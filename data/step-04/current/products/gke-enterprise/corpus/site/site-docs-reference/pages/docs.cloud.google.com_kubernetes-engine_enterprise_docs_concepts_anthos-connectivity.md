Impact of temporary disconnection from Google Cloud
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Distributed Cloud software only is based on Kubernetes, and you can
deploy it on-premises on either VMware or bare metal servers. Although
Distributed Cloud runs on-premises, we design it to have a
permanent connection to Google Cloud for a number of reasons, including
monitoring and management. However, you might need to know what happens if, for
any reason, you lose the connection to Google Cloud (for example, because of a
technical problem). This document outlines the impact of a loss of connectivity
for clusters in a Distributed Cloud software-only deployment (on
bare metal or on VMware), and which workarounds you can use in this event.
This information is useful for architects who need to prepare for an unplanned
or forced disconnection from Google Cloud and understand its consequences.
However, you shouldn't plan to use a software-only
Distributed Cloud deployment that's disconnected from
Google Cloud as a nominal working mode. Remember that we design
Distributed Cloud to take advantage of the scalability and
availability of Google Cloud services. This document draws on the design and
architecture of the various Google Cloud components that work compatibly with
Distributed Cloud during a temporary interruption. We can't
guarantee that this document is exhaustive.
This document assumes that you are familiar with GKE. If that
isn't the case, we recommend that you first read the GKE
overview .
License validation and metering
If you have enabled the Anthos API
( anthos.googleapis.com )
in your Google Cloud project, the metering controller running in the cluster
generates and refreshes the license entitlement periodically. The tolerance for
disconnection is 12 hours. Additionally, the system requires the connection for
managing metering and billing.
This table lists the behavior of features related to licensing and metering in
case of temporary disconnection from Google Cloud:
Feature
Connected behavior
Temporary disconnection behavior
Maximum disconnection tolerance
Loss of connectivity workaround
License validation
The metering controller generates and refreshes the
license entitlement custom resource periodically, as long as
anthos.googleapis.com is enabled in the Google Cloud project.
The components that consume the entitlement custom resource support a
grace period: they continue to function as long as the entitlement custom
resource is refreshed within the grace period.
Unlimited. After the grace period expires, components start to
log errors. You can't upgrade your cluster anymore.
None
Metering and billing
The metering controller reports the vCPU capacity of the
cluster to the Google Cloud Service Control API for billing purposes.
An in-cluster agent persists billing records in the cluster during
disconnection and retrieves the records once the cluster re-connects to
Google Cloud.
Unlimited. However, metering information is required for compliance as
stated in the Service
Specific Terms for "Premium Software".
None
Cluster lifecycle
This section covers scenarios such as creating, updating, deleting, and resizing
clusters, as well as monitoring the status of these activities.
For most scenarios, you can use CLI tools such as bmctl , gkectl , and
kubectl to perform operations during a temporary disconnection. You can also
monitor the status of these operations with these tools. Upon reconnection, the
Google Cloud console updates to display the results of operations performed during
the disconnected period.

Use kubectl to directly query your clusters and get the
information you need.
Removing nodes from a cluster
You don't need a connection to Google Cloud to remove nodes from a
cluster.
You can remove nodes from a cluster.

Adding nodes to a cluster
The new node pulls container images from Container Registry to properly work.
A preflight check runs to validate that there is connectivity to
Google Cloud.
The preflight checks that run when adding a new node validate that there is
connectivity to Google Cloud. Therefore, you can't add a new node to a
cluster when disconnected.
Zero
None
Application lifecycle
A temporary disconnection from Google Cloud mostly doesn't affect managing your
applications running in an on-premises cluster. Only the
connect gateway
is affected. If you use Container Registry ,
Artifact Registry , Cloud Build , or
Cloud Deploy to manage your container images or CI/CD pipelines in
Google Cloud, they become unavailable in case of disconnection. Strategies to
deal with disconnection for those products are outside of the scope of this
document.

Application deployment
You deploy applications locally using kubectl , through CI/CD
tooling, or using the connect gateway.
The connect gateway isn't available. All other methods of
deployments still work as long as they connect directly to the Kubernetes
API.
Unlimited
If you use the connect gateway, switch to using
kubectl locally.

You scale out applications locally using kubectl , through CI/CD
tooling, or using the connect gateway.
The connect gateway isn't available. All other methods of
deployments still work as long as they connect directly to the Kubernetes
API.
Unlimited
If you use the connect gateway, switch to using
kubectl locally.
Logging and monitoring
Auditability helps your organization meet its regulatory requirements and
compliance policies. Distributed Cloud helps with auditability by
offering application logging, Kubernetes logging, and audit logging. Many
customers choose to use Google's Cloud Logging and
Cloud Monitoring to avoid managing a logging and monitoring
infrastructure on-premises. Other customers prefer to centralize their logs into
an on-premises system for aggregation. To support these customers,
Distributed Cloud supports direct integration to services such as
Prometheus .
In this mode, during temporary disconnection from Google Cloud, there is no
impact on logging or monitoring functionality.

Application logging using Cloud Logging
The system writes logs to Cloud Logging.
The system buffers logs to the local disk.
4.5h or 4GiB local buffer per node. When the buffer fills or the
disconnection lasts 4.5 hours, then the system drops the oldest entries.

Application and Kubernetes metrics written to Cloud Monitoring
The system writes metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
The system buffers metrics to the local disk.
24h or 6GiB local buffer per node for system metrics and 1GiB local buffer
per node for application metrics. When the buffer fills or the disconnection
lasts 24 hours, then the system drops the oldest entries
Use a local monitoring solution.
Accessing and reading monitoring data from Kubernetes and application
workloads
All metrics are available in the console
and through the Cloud Monitoring API.
The system doesn't update metrics in Cloud Monitoring during the
disconnection.
24h or 6GiB local buffer per node for system metrics and 1GiB local buffer
per node for application metrics. When the buffer fills or the disconnection
lasts 24 hours, then the system drops the oldest entries
Use a local monitoring solution.
Alerting rules and paging for metrics
Cloud Monitoring supports alerting. You can create
alerts for any metric. The system can send alerts through different channels.
The system doesn't trigger alerts while disconnected. The system only
triggers alerts from metrics data already sent into Cloud Monitoring.
Use a local monitoring and alerting solution.
Config and policy management
Config Sync and
Policy Controller
lets you manage configuration and policies at scale, across all of your
clusters. You store configurations and policies in a Git repository, and the
system automatically synchronizes them to your clusters.
Config Sync
Config Sync uses in-cluster agents to connect directly to a Git repository.
You can manage changes to the repository URL or the synchronization parameters
with the Google Cloud CLI or kubectl tools.
During temporary disconnection, synchronization remains unaffected if the
in-cluster agents can still reach the Git repository. However, if you change the
synchronization parameters with the gcloud CLI or the
console, the cluster doesn't apply them during the disconnection.
You can temporarily overwrite them locally using kubectl . Reconnection
overwrites any local changes.
Policy Controller
Policy Controller
enables the enforcement of fully programmable policies for your clusters. These
policies act as "guardrails" and prevent any changes that violate security,
operational, or compliance controls that you have defined.
Action
Connected behavior
Temporary disconnection behavior
Maximum disconnection tolerance
Loss of connectivity workaround
Syncing configuration from a Git repository
In-cluster agents connect directly to the Git repository. You can change the
repository URL or synchronization parameters with a Google Cloud API.
Configuration syncing remains unaffected. If you change the
synchronization parameters with the gcloud CLI or in the
console, the cluster doesn't apply them during the
disconnection. You can temporarily overwrite them locally using
kubectl . Reconnection overwrites any local changes.
Unlimited
Never use the
Fleet
API for Config Sync, and only configure it
by
using the Kubernetes API.
Enforcing policies on requests to the Kubernetes API
The in-cluster agent enforces constraints thanks to its integration with the
Kubernetes API. You manage policies using the local Kubernetes API. You manage
the system configuration of Policy Controller with a Google Cloud
API.
Policy enforcement remains unaffected. You still manage policies using the local
Kubernetes API. The system doesn't propagate changes to the Policy Controller system configuration
using the Google Cloud API to the cluster, but you can
temporarily overwrite them locally. Reconnection overwrites any local changes.
Unlimited
Never use the
Fleet
API for Policy Controller, and only configure it
by
using the Kubernetes API.
Installing, configuring, or upgrading Config Sync using the Google Cloud
API
You use the Google Cloud API to manage the installation and upgrade of
in-cluster agents. You also use this API (or the gcloud CLI, or the
console) to manage the configuration of these agents.
In-cluster agents continue to operate normally. You can't install, upgrade,
or configure in-cluster agents using the Google Cloud API. Any pending
installations, upgrades, or configurations done using the API proceed upon
reconnection.
Zero
Never use the Fleet
API for Policy Controller, and only configure it
by
using the Kubernetes API.
Viewing system or sync status in the console
You can view the health of the in-cluster agents and the synchronization
status using a Google Cloud API or the console.
Status information in the Google Cloud API or console becomes
stale. The API shows a connection error. All the information remains available
on a per-cluster basis using the local Kubernetes API.
Zero
Use the nomos CLI or the local Kubernetes API.
Security
This section outlines how security features, including identity, authentication,
authorization, and secret management, are affected by a temporary disconnection
from Google Cloud.
Identity, authentication, and authorization
Distributed Cloud can connect directly to Cloud Identity for
application and user roles, to manage workloads using Connect, or for
endpoint authentication using OIDC . A
disconnection from Google Cloud severs the connection to Cloud Identity,
making those features unavailable. For workloads that require additional
resiliency through a temporary disconnection, you can use
GKE Identity Service to integrate
with an LDAP or OIDC provider (including
ADFS )
to configure end-user authentication.
Feature
Connected behavior
Temporary disconnection behavior
Maximum disconnection tolerance
Loss of connectivity workaround
Cloud Identity as identity provider, using the
connect gateway
You can access Distributed Cloud resources using
Cloud Identity as the identity provider, and connecting through the
connect gateway.
The connect gateway requires a connection to Google Cloud. You
aren't able to connect to your clusters during the disconnection.
Zero
Use GKE Identity Service to federate with another identity
provider.
Identity and authentication using a third-party identity provider
Supports OIDC and LDAP. You use the gcloud CLI to first log in.
For OIDC providers, you can use the console to log in. You can
then authenticate normally against the cluster API (for example, using
kubectl ).
As long as the identity provider remains accessible to both you and the
cluster, then you can still authenticate against the cluster API. You can't
log in through the console. You can only update the OIDC or LDAP
configuration of your clusters locally, you can't use the
console.
Unlimited
-
Authorization
Distributed Cloud supports role-based access control (RBAC).
Roles can be attributed to users, groups, or service accounts. The system
retrieves user identities and groups from the identity provider.
The RBAC system is local to the Kubernetes cluster, and disconnection
from Google Cloud doesn't affect it. However, if it relies on identities
coming from Cloud Identity then, they aren't available in case of
disconnection.
Unlimited
-
Secret and key management
Secret and key management is an important part of your security posture. The
behavior of Distributed Cloud in case of disconnection from
Google Cloud depends on which service you are using for those features.
Feature
Connected behavior
Temporary disconnection behavior
Maximum disconnection tolerance
Loss of connectivity workaround
Secret and key management using Cloud Key Management Service and Secret Manager
You directly use Cloud Key Management Service for your cryptographic keys, and
Secret Manager for your secrets.
Both Cloud Key Management Service and Secret Manager aren't available.
Zero
Use local systems instead.
Secret and key management using Hashicorp Vault and
Google Cloud services
You configure Hashicorp Vault to use Cloud Storage or Spanner
to store secrets, and Cloud Key Management Service to manage keys.
If Hashicorp Vault runs on your on-premises cluster and the disconnection
also impacts it, then secret storage and key management aren't available
during the disconnection.
Zero
Use local systems instead.
Secret and key management using Hashicorp Vault and on-premises services
You configure Hashicorp Vault to use an on-premises storage backend for
secrets, and an on-premises key management system (such as a hardware
security module).
Disconnection from Google Cloud has no impact.

Networking and network services
This section covers the networking and network services for on-premises
clusters, including how they are impacted by a temporary disconnection from
Google Cloud. It provides information on load balancing, Cloud Service Mesh, and
other network services.
Load Balancing
To expose Kubernetes Services hosted in an on-premises cluster to users, you
have the following options:
Bare metal:
Use a provided bundled load balancer,
MetalLB
or Bundled with
BGP .
Manually configure your clusters to use your own load
balancer ,
external to Distributed Cloud.
VMware:
Use the provided bundled load balancer,
MetalLB .
Manually configure your clusters to use your own load
balancer ,
external to Distributed Cloud.
These load balancing options remain operational even if disconnected from
Google Cloud.

Deploying or updating policies (routing, authorization, security, audit,
etc.)
You can use the console, kubectl , asmcli , or istioctl to manage
Cloud Service Mesh policies.
You can only use kubectl or istioctl to manage Cloud Service Mesh policies.
Unlimited
Use kubectl or istioctl
Certificate authority (CA)
You can use either the in-cluster CA or the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority to manage
the certificates used by Cloud Service Mesh.
There is no impact if you are using the in-cluster CA. If you are using
the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, then certificates expire after 24 hours. New
service instances can't retrieve certificates.
Unlimited for in-cluster CA. Degraded service during 24h, and no service
after 24h for Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority.
Use the in-cluster CA.
Cloud Monitoring for Cloud Service Mesh
You can use Cloud Monitoring to store, explore and exploit HTTP-related
metrics coming from Cloud Service Mesh.
Metrics aren't stored.
Zero
Use a compatible local monitoring solution such as Prometheus.
Cloud Service Mesh audit logging
Cloud Service Mesh relies on the local Kubernetes logging facilities. The
behavior depends on how you configured logging for your on-premises
cluster.

Egress proxy
You can configure your on-premises clusters to use a proxy for egress connections.
If your proxy runs on-premises, the cluster is still able to use it
during a temporary disconnection. However, if the proxy loses the
connection to Google Cloud, then all the scenarios from this document
still apply.

Sharing a cluster snapshot with the support team
You can create a cluster snapshot locally using the bmctl check
cluster or gkectl diagnose snapshot commands. You share
this snapshot through the normal support process.
You can still generate the snapshot as it is a local operation. If you
lost access to Google Cloud and its support web interfaces, you can phone
the support team provided you have subscribed to the Enhanced or Premium
support plans.
