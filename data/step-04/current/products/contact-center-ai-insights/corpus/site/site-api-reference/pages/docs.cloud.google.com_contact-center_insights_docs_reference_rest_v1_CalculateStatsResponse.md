Fields
averageDuration
string ( Duration format)
The average duration of all conversations. The average is calculated using only conversations that have a time duration.
A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with ' s '. Example: "3.5s" .
averageTurnCount
integer
The average number of turns per conversation.
conversationCount
integer
The total number of conversations.
smartHighlighterMatches
map (key: string, value: integer)
A map associating each smart highlighter display name with its respective number of matches in the set of conversations.
An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" } .
customHighlighterMatches
map (key: string, value: integer)
A map associating each custom highlighter resource name with its respective number of matches in the set of conversations.
An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" } .
issueMatches (deprecated)
map (key: string, value: integer)
This item is deprecated!
A map associating each issue resource name with its respective number of matches in the set of conversations. Key has the format: projects/<Project-ID>/locations/<Location-ID>/issueModels/<Issue-Model-ID>/issues/<Issue-ID> Deprecated, use issueMatchesStats field instead.
An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" } .
issueMatchesStats
map (key: string, value: object ( IssueStats ))
A map associating each issue resource name with its respective number of matches in the set of conversations. Key has the format: projects/<Project-ID>/locations/<Location-ID>/issueModels/<Issue-Model-ID>/issues/<Issue-ID>
An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" } .
conversationCountTimeSeries
object ( TimeSeries )
A time series representing the count of conversations created over time that match that requested filter criteria.
TimeSeries
A time series representing conversations over time.
JSON representation
{
"intervalDuration" : string ,
"points" : [
{
object ( Interval )
}
]
}
Fields
intervalDuration
string ( Duration format)
The duration of each interval.
A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with ' s '. Example: "3.5s" .
points[]
object ( Interval )
An ordered list of intervals from earliest to latest, where each interval represents the number of conversations that transpired during the time window.
Interval
A single interval in a time series.
JSON representation
{
"startTime" : string ,
"conversationCount" : integer
}
Fields
startTime
string ( Timestamp format)
The start time of this interval.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and uses 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
