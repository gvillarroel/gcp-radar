CEL matcher language reference
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Common Expression Language (CEL) is an
open source non-Turing complete language that implements common semantics for
expression evaluation. Service Extensions uses a subset of CEL
conditions to make chain evaluation decisions based on attribute data. In
general, a condition expression consists of one or more statements that are
joined by logical operators ( && , || , or ! ).
Attributes
For any given connection request, the proxy extracts attributes,
which are a set of contextual information. Attributes have a fixed type (such as
string or int ), and might be absent or present, depending on the context.
Attributes are exposed to the CEL runtime during match condition processing.
Attributes are not available to be sent to an extension service.
Request attributes
The following attributes can be extracted from requests:
Attribute
Attribute type
Description
request.headers
map{string,string}
A string-to-string map of the HTTP request headers. If a header
contains multiple values, the value in this map is a comma-separated
string of all values of the header. The keys in this map are in
lowercase.
request.method
string
The HTTP request method, such as GET or POST .
request.host
string
Convenience equivalent to request.headers['host'] .
request.path
string
The requested HTTP URL path.
request.query
string
The HTTP URL query in the format of
name1=value&name2=value2 , as it appears in the first line
of the HTTP request.
No decoding is performed.
request.scheme
string
The HTTP URL scheme, such as HTTP or HTTPS. Values for this attribute
are in lowercase.
request.backend_service_name
string
The backend service to which the request is forwarded.
Not applicable for edge extensions.
request.backend_service_project_number
int
When using Shared VPC, the project number of the backend
service to which the request is forwarded.
Not applicable for edge extensions.
Connection attributes
The following attributes can be extracted from connections:
Attribute
Attribute type
Description
source.ip
string
The source IP address of the request.
source.port
int
The connection port of the downstream client.
connection.sni
string
The requested server name of the downstream TLS connection.
connection.tls_version
string
The TLS version of the downstream TLS connection. Valid values:
TLSv1 , TLSv1.1 , TLSv1.2 , and
TLSv1.3 .
connection.sha256_peer_certificate_digest
string
The hexadecimal-encoded SHA256 hash of the peer certificate in the
downstream TLS connection, if present.
Operators
Service Extensions supports several operators that you can use
to build complex match conditions from simple expression statements.
Service Extensions supports
logical operators, such as && , || , and ! , and string manipulation
operators, such as x.contains('y') .
String manipulation operators match strings or substrings that you define. For
example, request.host.endsWith('.example.com') evaluates to true if the HTTP
request was made to a domain ending with example.com .
Logical operators let you verify multiple variables in a conditional
expression. For example,
request.method == 'GET' && request.host.matches('.example.com') joins two
statements and requires both statements to be true to produce an
overall result of true .
Logical operators
The following table describes the logical operators that Service Extensions
supports.
Example expression
Description
x == "foo"
Returns true if x is equal to the constant
string literal argument.
x == R"fo'o"
Returns true if x is equal to the given raw
string literal that does not interpret escape sequences. Raw string
literals are convenient for expressing strings that the code must
use to escape sequence characters.
x == y
Returns true if x is equal to
y .
x != y
Returns true if x is not equal to
y .
x && y
Returns true if both x and y
are true .
x || y
Returns true if x , y , or both
are true .
!x
Returns true if the boolean value x is
false , or returns false if the boolean value
x is true .
m['k']
If key k is present, returns the value at key
k in the string-to-string map m . If key
k is not present, returns an error that
causes the rule under evaluation to not match.
String manipulation operators
The following table describes the string manipulation operators that
Service Extensions supports.
Expression
Description
x.contains(y)
Returns true if the string x contains the
substring y .
x.startsWith(y)
Returns true if the string x begins with the
substring y .
x.endsWith(y)
Returns true if the string x ends with the
substring y .
x.matches(y)
Returns true if the string x matches the
specified
RE2 pattern y .
Service Extensions uses the RE2::Latin1 option when it
compiles the RE2 pattern, which disables Unicode features.
Edge extensions let you use only one regular expression per
CEL expression.
x.lower()
Returns the lowercase value of string x .
x.upper()
Returns the uppercase value of string x .
int(x)
Converts the string result of x to an int
type. You can use the converted string for integer comparison by using
standard arithmetic operators, such as greater than ( > )
and less than or equal to ( ≤ ).
This works only for values that can be integers.
Sample expressions
Match all requests to host example.com with backend service bs1 in 123
as the final destination:
request.host == "example.com" && request.backend_service_name == "bs1" &&
request.backend_service_project_number == 123
Match all requests for the path */inventory with an HTTP header Hello :
request.path.endsWith("/inventory") && request.headers["Hello"] != ""
Limitations
The following limitations apply to CEL expressions when specified for
Service Extensions:
Maximum expressions per extension: 1 for edge extensions and 5 for
other extensions
Maximum number of characters per regular expression: 100
Maximum number of characters per CEL expression: 500
