Use the API - Insights
This page explains how to view and manage
insights in Recommender using
gcloud commands or the
REST API .
A typical insight interaction with the Recommender API is:
List the insights for a specific project
Mark an insight that you intend to take action on as
accepted
Set the default project
Set the default project if you haven't done so already:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
where PROJECT_ID is the ID of your project.
Set environment variables
Set environment variables for Recommender interactions:
PROJECT= TARGET_PROJECT_ID
LOCATION= LOCATION_ID
INSIGHT_TYPE= INSIGHT_TYPE_ID
where:
TARGET_PROJECT_ID is the project whose insights
you want to list. This can be a different project than your current project.
For gcloud commands, you must use the project ID
For API requests, you can use the project number or project ID. Project
number is recommended.
The project number is returned in responses from both the API and gcloud
commands.
LOCATION_ID is the Google Cloud
location where resources
associated with the insights are located (for example, global or
us-central1-a ).
INSIGHT_TYPE_ID is the fully-qualified
insight type ID (for example,
google.iam.policy.Insight ).
See Insight types for a table of links to information
about each insight type, including supported locations and insight type IDs.
Set permissions
You must have permissions to access insights in the target project.
For requesters who include a billing project in their request. The project
used in the request must be in good standing, and the user must have a role in
the project that contains the serviceusage.services.use permission. The
Service Usage Consumer role contains the required permission.
Each insight type requires specific permissions. See Insight types
for a table of links to information about each insight type, including the
required permissions.
Note: If you use the x-goog-user-project header or
userProject query string parameter in your request, you must have
serviceusage.services.use permission for the project ID that you specify,
in addition to the normal IAM permissions required
to make the request.
List insights
As shown in the gcloud Beta tab, you can list all of your project's
insights without having to specify a location and recommender. This
feature is in Preview.
The GA feature requires that you specify a
project, location, and recommender. For details, see the gcloud tab.
gcloud Beta
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Enter the following:
gcloud beta recommender insights list \
--project=${PROJECT} \
--format= FORMAT
where FORMAT is a supported Google Cloud CLI
output format , such as
json .
For example:
gcloud beta recommender insights list \
--project=example-project \
--format=json
Note: Unlike the following output for the gcloud and REST
tabs, which is limited to insights for a location and recommender, the
output will include all insights for the project.
gcloud
Enter the following:
gcloud recommender insights list \
--project=${PROJECT} \
--location=${LOCATION} \
--insight-type=${INSIGHT_TYPE} \
--format= FORMAT
where FORMAT is a supported gcloud
output format (for example,
json ).
For example:
gcloud recommender insights list \
--project=example-project \
--location=global \
--insight-type=google.iam.policy.Insight \
--format=json
REST
Enter the following:
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: ${PROJECT}" \
"https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT}/locations/${LOCATION}/insightTypes/${INSIGHT_TYPE}/insights"
For example:
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: example-project" \
"https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1/projects/example-project/locations/us-central1-a/insightTypes/google.iam.policy.Insight/insights"
This operation outputs the current IAM policy insights in the target project as
a list of Insight entities in the
specified format.
The output is similar to the following:
[
{
"category": "SECURITY",
"content": {
"condition": {
"description": "",
"expression": "",
"location": "",
"title": ""
},
"exercisedPermissions": [],
"inferredPermissions": [],
"member": "user:my-service-account@example-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
"role": "roles/iam.securityReviewer"
},
"description": "0 permission checks were authorized by this policy binding tuple.",
"etag": "\"45f4e2c63f6952e8\"",
"insightSubtype": "PERMISSIONS_USAGE",
"lastRefreshTime": "2020-03-06T08:00:00Z",
"name": "projects/32428390823/locations/global/insightTypes/google.iam.policy.Insight/insights/a523ff7e-ed03-4143-a3a5-5b396b99cba9",
"observationPeriod": "7776000s",
"stateInfo": {
"state": "ACTIVE",
},
"targetResources": [
"//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/32428390823"
],
}
]
Note that the returned insights include the following fields:
A name field in the following format:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /insightTypes/ INSIGHT_TYPE_ID /insights/ INSIGHT_ID
where INSIGHT_ID uniquely identifies the insight
An etag field that is associated with the current insight state.
When you reference an insight using subsequent gcloud commands or
REST API calls, you reference both the insight ID and etag, which makes
sure that any operations are performed only if the insight has not
been modified since you last retrieved it.
Mark an insight as accepted
You can mark an insight as accepted to indicate that you intend to take or have
taken an action on an associated resource based on the information provided in
the insight. When an insight is accepted, your user name is assigned as the
actor for the insight, and Recommender will not update the insight
with newer content.
To mark an insight as accepted:
gcloud
Enter the following:
gcloud recommender insights mark-accepted \
INSIGHT_ID \
--project=${PROJECT} \
--location=${LOCATION} \
--insight-type=${INSIGHT_TYPE} \
--etag= etag \
--state-metadata= STATE_METADATA
--format= FORMAT
where:
INSIGHT_ID is the ID of an insight
retrieved from a previous call to list insights
etag is the returned etag representing the insight state
STATE_METADATA is an optional metadata about the operation.
Specify the metadata as a comma-separated list of
KEY = VALUE pairs.
For example:
gcloud recommender insights mark-accepted \
a523ff7e-ed03-4143-a3a5-5b396b99cba9 \
--project=example-project \
--location=global \
--insight-type=google.iam.policy.Insight \
--etag='"280b34810bba8a1a"' \
--state-metadata=priority=high,tracking_number=12345
--format=json
REST
Enter the following:
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: ${PROJECT}" \
--data-binary @- \
https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT}/locations/${LOCATION}/insightTypes/${INSIGHT_TYPE}/insights/ INSIGHT_ID :markAccepted \
<< EOM
{
"etag": " etag ",
"stateMetadata": STATE_METADATA
}
EOM
where:
INSIGHT_ID is the ID of an insight
retrieved from a previous call to list insights
etag is the returned etag representing the insight state
STATE_METADATA is an optional field with additional metadata
about the operation. Specify the metadata as key:value pairs.
For example:
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: example-project" \
--data-binary @- \
https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1/projects/example-project/locations/global/insightTypes/google.iam.policy.Insight/insights/a523ff7e-ed03-4143-a3a5-5b396b99cba9:markAccepted \
<< EOM
{
"etag": "\"280b34810bba8a1a\""
"stateMetadata": {
"priority" : "high",
"tracking_number": "12345"
}
}
EOM
This operation returns the
Insight entity in the
specified format after the operation has taken place.
The output is similar to the following:
{
"category": "SECURITY",
"content": { ... },
"description": "0 permission checks were authorized by this policy binding tuple.",
"etag": "\"356ae51165729f38\"",
"insightSubtype": "PERMISSIONS_USAGE",
"lastModifiedUser": "admin123@example-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
"lastRefreshTime": "2020-03-06T08:00:00Z",
"name": "projects/32428390823/locations/global/insightTypes/google.iam.policy.Insight/insights/a523ff7e-ed03-4143-a3a5-5b396b99cba9",
"observationPeriod": "7776000s",
"stateInfo": {
"state": "ACCEPTED",
"stateMetadata": {
"priority" : "high",
"tracking_number": "12345"
}
},
"targetResources": [
