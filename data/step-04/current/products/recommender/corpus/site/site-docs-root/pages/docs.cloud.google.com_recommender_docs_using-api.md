Use the API - Recommendations
This page explains how to view and manage
recommendations in
Recommender by using gcloud commands
or the REST API .
A typical recommendation interaction with the Recommender API is:
List the recommendations for a
specific project.
Mark a recommendation that you intend to
apply as claimed , or mark a recommendation that you don't intend to apply
as dismissed .
Apply the recommendation. You can do this automatically
using Active Assist
in the Google Cloud console, or manually using the Google Cloud CLI commands,
REST API calls, or other tools.
When you manually apply the recommendation, the commands or calls that you
use are specific to the resource type. For example, to change the size of a
VM instance in response to a recommendation from the VM instance sizing
recommender, you use Compute Engine
gcloud commands or calls to
the Compute Engine REST API .
When you perform these operations, you identify the target resource by using
the value of the resource field in the OperationsGroup array in the
returned
Recommendation
entity. This field is in the following format:
// API_NAME / RESOURCE_PATH
For example:
//compute.googleapis.com/projects/example-project/zones/us-central1-a/instances/instance-1
Mark the recommendation as
succeeded or failed .
Note that only recommendations retrieved through the API can be interacted with
using the API or BigQuery Export .
For information about changing the state of recommendations in the
Google Cloud console, refer to the documentation for
Active Assist
or for the appropriate recommender .
Warning:
Before applying recommendations in the Google Cloud console or
using the API, ensure that impacts are assessed by a reviewer within your organization.
The reviewer should have the knowledge to assess impacts identified in
recommendations, as well as impacts specific to your infrastructure and
business. Applying recommendations without proper assessment could result in
unexpected changes, such as issues with system performance, poor reliability, or
loss of required permissions. If you choose to apply recommendations without
human review, ensure that you have set up a rollback process before making any
changes.
Set the default project
Set the default project if you haven't done so already:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
where PROJECT_ID is the ID of your project.
Set environment variables
Set environment variables for Recommender interactions:
PROJECT= TARGET_PROJECT_ID
LOCATION= LOCATION_ID
RECOMMENDER= RECOMMENDER_ID
where:
TARGET_PROJECT_ID is the project whose recommendations
you want to list. This can be a different project than your current project.
For gcloud commands, you must use the project ID
For API requests, you can use the project number or project ID. Project
number is recommended.
The project number is returned in responses from both the API and gcloud
commands.
LOCATION_ID is the Google Cloud
location where resources
associated with the recommendations are located (for example, global or
us-central1-a ).
RECOMMENDER_ID is the fully-qualified
recommender ID (for example,
google.compute.instance.MachineTypeRecommender ).
See Recommenders for a table of links to
information about each recommender, including supported locations and
recommender IDs.
Set permissions
You must have permissions to access recommendations in the target project.
For requesters who include a billing project in their request. The project
used in the request must be in good standing, and the user must have a role in
the project that contains the serviceusage.services.use permission. The
Service Usage Consumer role contains the required permission.
Each recommender requires specific permissions. See
Recommenders for a table of links to
information about each recommender, including the required permissions.
Note: If you use the
x-goog-user-project header or userProject query string parameter
in your request, you must have the serviceusage.services.use permission for
the project ID that you specify, in addition to the normal IAM
permissions required to make the request.
List recommendations
As shown in the gcloud Beta tab, you can list all of your project's
recommendations without having to specify a location and recommender. This
feature is in Preview.
The GA feature requires that you specify a
project, location, and recommender. For details, see the gcloud tab.
gcloud Beta
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Enter the following:
gcloud beta recommender recommendations list \
--project=${PROJECT} \
--format= FORMAT
where FORMAT is a supported gcloud
output format , such as
json .
For example:
gcloud beta recommender recommendations list \
--project=example-project \
--format=json
Note: Unlike the following output for the gcloud and REST
tabs, which is limited to recommendations for a location and recommender,
the output will include all recommendations for the project.
gcloud
Enter the following:
gcloud recommender recommendations list \
--project=${PROJECT} \
--location=${LOCATION} \
--recommender=${RECOMMENDER} \
--format= FORMAT
where FORMAT is a supported gcloud
output format (for example,
json ).
For example:
gcloud recommender recommendations list \
--project=example-project \
--location=us-central1-a \
--recommender=google.compute.instance.MachineTypeRecommender \
--format=json
REST
Enter the following:
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: ${PROJECT}" \
"https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT}/locations/${LOCATION}/recommenders/${RECOMMENDER}/recommendations"
For example:
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: example-project" \
"https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1/projects/example-project/locations/us-central1-a/recommenders/google.compute.instance.MachineTypeRecommender/recommendations"
This operation outputs the current VM instance sizing recommendations
in the target project as a list of
Recommendation
entities in the specified format.
The output is similar to the following:
[
{
"content": {
"operationGroups": [
{

]
Note that the returned recommendations include the following fields:
A name field in the following format:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /recommenders/ RECOMMENDER_ID /recommendations/ RECOMMENDATION_ID
where RECOMMENDATION_ID uniquely identifies the recommendation
An etag field that is associated with the current recommendation state.
When you reference a recommendation using subsequent Google Cloud CLI commands or
REST API calls, you reference both the recommendation ID and etag, which makes
sure that any operations are performed only if the recommendation has not
been modified since you last retrieved it.
Change the state of a recommendation
You can mark a recommendation as claimed to indicate that you intend to apply
the recommended changes to the associated resource. When a recommendation is
claimed, your username is assigned as the actor for the recommendation, and
Recommender does not update the recommendation with newer content.
You can mark a recommendation as dismissed to indicate that you don't intend to
apply the recommended changes to the associated resource or that you don't want
to continue to see the recommendation. When a recommendation is dismissed, it
will no longer appear as an ACTIVE recommendation. Recommender might
continue to update the recommendation with newer content.
After you have applied a recommendation, you can mark it as succeeded or failed.
To change the state of a recommendation, complete the following steps:
gcloud
Enter the following:
gcloud recommender recommendations STATE_CHANGE \
RECOMMENDATION_ID \
--project=${PROJECT} \
--location=${LOCATION} \
--recommender=${RECOMMENDER} \
--etag= ETAG \
--state-metadata= STATE_METADATA \
--format= FORMAT
Where
STATE_CHANGE is the change you want to make to a recommendation.
Valid values are:
mark-claimed to mark the recommendation as claimed.
mark-dismissed to mark the recommendation as dismissed.
mark-succeeded to mark the recommendation as succeeded.
mark-failed to mark the recommendation as failed.
RECOMMENDATION_ID is the ID of a recommendation that you
retrieved from a previous call to list recommendations.
ETAG is the returned etag representing the recommendation state
STATE_METADATA is optional metadata about the operation.
Specify the metadata as a comma-separated list of
KEY = VALUE pairs. This
option is available when you mark a recommendation as
claimed, succeeded, or failed.
For example:
gcloud recommender recommendations mark-succeeded \
a523ff7e-ed03-4143-a3a5-5b396b99cba9 \
--project=example-project \
--location=us-central1-a \
