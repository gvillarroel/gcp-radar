Export recommendations to BigQuery
Overview
With BigQuery export, you can view daily snapshots of recommendations
for your organization. This is done using the BigQuery Data Transfer Service. See
Recommenders to see which recommenders are
included in BigQuery export today.
BigQuery export supports the following:
Exporting recommendations and insights for all projects, folders, and billing
accounts for an organization (including organization-level recommendations
and insights)
Exporting negotiated pricing instead of standard pricing for cost savings
recommendations.
Before you begin
Complete the following steps before you create a data transfer for recommendations:
Allow the BigQuery Data Transfer Service permission to manage your data transfer. If
you use the BigQuery web UI to create the transfer, you must allow
pop-ups from console.cloud.google.com on your browser to be able
to view the permissions. For more details, see enable a BigQuery Data Transfer Service.
Create a
BigQuery dataset to store data.
The data transfer uses the same region where the dataset is created.
The location is immutable once the dataset and transfer are created.
The dataset will contain insights and recommendations from all regions
across the globe. Thus this operation would aggregate all those data into a
global region during the process. Please refer to
Google Cloud Customer Care if there are
any data residency concerns.
If the dataset location is newly launched, there may be a delay in
initial export data availability.
Pricing
Exporting recommendations to BigQuery is available to all
Recommender customers based on their Recommender pricing tier .
Required permissions
While setting up the data transfer, you require the following permissions at the
project level where you create a data transfer:
bigquery.transfers.update - Allows you to create the transfer
bigquery.datasets.update - Allows you to update actions on the target dataset
resourcemanager.projects.update - Allows you to select a project where you'd like the export data to be stored
pubsub.topics.list - Allows you to select a Pub/Sub topic in order to receive notifications about your export
The following permission is required at the organization level. This organization
corresponds to the one that the export is being set up for.
recommender.resources.export - Allows you to export
recommendations to BigQuery
The following permissions are required to export negotiated prices for cost savings
recommendations:
billing.resourceCosts.get at project level - Allows exporting negotiated prices for project level recommendations
billing.accounts.getSpendingInformation at billing account level - Allows exporting negotiated prices for billing account level recommendations
Without these permissions, cost savings recommendations will be exported with
standard prices instead of negotiated prices.
Note: The latest available permissions are used to determine whether negotiated prices
are exported. If you have recently added or removed permissions, there may be a few
days delay before prices are updated in the export. Note: Service accounts are currently not supported via the UI - see instructions
below on using the API/CLI if you want to set up an export using a service account.
Grant permissions
The following roles have to be granted on the project where you create the
data transfer:
To allow you to create a transfer and update actions on the target dataset,
you must grant the following role:
BigQuery admin role - roles/bigquery.admin
There are multiple roles that contain permissions to select a project for
storing your export data and for selecting a Pub/Sub topic to receive notifications.
To have both these permissions available, you can grant the following role:
Project owner role - roles/owner
There are multiple roles that contain the permission billing.resourceCosts.get
to export negotiated prices for cost savings project level recommendations -
you can grant any one of them:
Project Owner role - roles/owner
Project Viewer role - roles/viewer
Project Editor role - roles/editor
There are multiple roles that contain the permission billing.accounts.getSpendingInformation
to export negotiated prices for cost savings billing account level recommendations -
you can grant any one of them:
Billing Account Administrator role - roles/billing.admin
Billing Account Costs Manager role - roles/billing.costsManager
Billing Account Viewer role - roles/billing.viewer
You must grant the following role at the organization level:
Recommendations Exporter ( roles/recommender.exporter ) role on the Google Cloud console.
Note: If you do not have this permission granted, the daily run history status shows that the permission is
missing. Upon granting this permission, the future exports will run successfully. You also have
the option to retry the export for the runs that didn't have the permission granted.
You can also create Custom
roles containing the required permissions .
Create a data transfer for recommendations
Go to the BigQuery export form for Active Assist.
Go to BigQuery export form
Select a Destination Project to store the recommendation data.
Note: If you can't find the project, then you either don't have the necessary
permissions ,
or there aren't any projects available.
Click Next .
Click Enable APIs to enable the BigQuery APIs for the export.
This can take a several seconds to complete. Once done, click Continue .
Note: If the APIs are already enabled for this project, this step is skipped.
On the Configure Transfer form, provide the following details:
In the Transfer config name section, for Display name , enter a name
for the transfer. The transfer name can be any value that allows you to easily
identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.
In the Schedule options section, for Schedule , leave the
default value ( Start now ) or click Start at a set time .
For Repeats , choose an option for how often to run the
transfer.
Daily (default)
Weekly
Monthly
Custom
On-demand
For Start date and run time , enter the date and time to start
the transfer. If you choose Start now , this option is disabled.
In the Destination settings section, for Destination dataset ,
choose the dataset ID you created to store your data.
In the Data source details section:
The default value for organization_id is the organization that you
are currently viewing recommendations for. If you want to export
recommendations to another organization, you can change this on top of
the console in the organization viewer.
Note: Recommendations for projects without organizations are not exported.
(Optional) In the Notification options section:
Click the toggle to enable email notifications. When you enable this
option, the transfer administrator receives an email notification
when a transfer run fails.
For Select a Pub/Sub topic , choose your topic
name or click Create a topic . This option
configures Pub/Sub run notifications
for your transfer.
Click Create to create the transfer.
Click Allow on the consent pop-up.
Note: By allowing consent, this permits the usage of scopes BigQuery and Google Cloud Platform APIs in your data transfer.
These APIs are used to view and manage your data in https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery
and https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform .
These APIs are only used for projects and organizations that you have access to based on the permissions set.
Once the transfer is created, you are directed back to the Active Assist.
You can click the link to access the transfer configuration details.
Alternatively, you can access the transfers by doing the following:
Go to the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the BigQuery page
Click Data Transfers . You can view all the available data transfers.
View the run history for a transfer
To view the run history for a transfer, do the following:
Go to the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the BigQuery page
Click Data Transfers . You can view all the available data transfers.
Note: A transfer is complete when the status appears green.
Click the appropriate transfer in the list.
In the list of run transfers displayed under the RUN HISTORY tab, select the transfer you want to view the details for.
The Run details panel is displayed for the individual run transfer you selected.
Some of the possible run details displayed are:
Deferred transfer due to unavailable source data.
Job indicating the number of rows exported to a table
Missing permissions for a datasource that you must grant and later schedule a backfill.
When does your data get exported?
When you create a data transfer, the first export occurs in two days.
After the first export, the export jobs run at the cadence you have requested at set up time. The following conditions apply:
The export job for a specific day (D) exports the end-of-day 's (D) data to your BigQuery dataset, which usually finishes by the end-of-next-day (D+1). The export job runs in PST time zone and may appear to have additional delay for other time zones.
The daily export job does not run until all the data for export is available. This can result in variations, and sometimes delays, in the day and time that your
dataset is updated. Therefore, it is best to use the latest available snapshot of data rather
than having a hard time sensitive dependency on specific dated tables.
The export job transfers latest available data per region - this means there could be a difference
in the latest date that different regions recommendations are available for.
Common status messages on an export
Learn about common status messages you can see exporting recommendations to BigQuery.
User does not have required permission
The following message occurs when user does not have required permission recommender.resources.export . You will see the following message:
User does not have required permission "recommender.resources.export". Please, obtain the required permissions for the datasource and try again by triggering a backfill for this date
To resolve this issue grant the IAM role roles/recommender.exporter to user/service account setting up the export at organizational level for the organization for which the export was set up for. It can be given through the gcloud commands below:
In case of User:
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding *<organization_id>* --member = 'user:*<user_name>*' --role = 'roles/recommender.exporter'
In case of Service Account:
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding *<organization_id>* --member = 'serviceAccount:*<service_acct_name>*' --role = 'roles/recommender.exporter'
Note: Granting permissions to Service accounts are currently not supported via the UI.
Transfer deferred due to source data not being available
The following message occurs when the transfer is rescheduled because the source data is not yet available. This is not an error. It means the export pipelines have not completed yet for the day. The transfer will re-run at the new scheduled time and will succeed once the export pipelines have completed. You will see the following message:
Transfer deferred due to source data not being available
Source data not found
The following message occurs when the export pipelines have completed, but no recommendations or insights were found for the organization that the export was set up for. You will see the following message:
Source data not found for 'recommendations_export$<date>'insights_export$<date>
This message occurs due to following reasons:
The user set up the export less than 2 days ago. The customer guide lets customers know that there is a day's delay before their export will be available.
There are no recommendations or insights available for their organization for the specific day. This could be the actual case or the pipelines may have run before all recommendations or insights were available for the day.
View tables for a transfer
When you export recommendations to BigQuery, the dataset contains
two tables that are partitioned by date:
recommendations_export
insight_export
For more details on tables and schema, see Creating and using tables and Specifying a schema .
To view the tables for a data transfer, do the following:
Go to the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the BigQuery page
Click Data Transfers . You can view all the available data transfers.
Click the appropriate transfer in the list.
Click the CONFIGURATION tab and click the dataset.
In the Explorer panel, expand your project and select a dataset.
The description and details appear in the details panel. The tables for a dataset are listed with the dataset name in the Explorer panel.
Schedule a backfill
Recommendations for a date in the past (this date being later than the date when the organization
was opted in for the export) can be exported by scheduling a backfill.
To schedule a backfill, do the following:
Go to the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the BigQuery page
Click Data Transfers .
On the Transfers page, click on an appropriate transfer in the list.
Click Schedule backfill .
In the Schedule backfill dialog, choose your Start date and
End date .

Example queries
You can use the following sample queries to analyze your exported data.
Viewing cost savings for recommendations where the recommendation duration is
displayed in days
SELECT name , recommender , target_resources ,
case primary_impact . cost_projection . cost . units is null
when true then round ( primary_impact . cost_projection . cost . nanos * power ( 10 , - 9 ), 2 )
else
round ( primary_impact . cost_projection . cost . units +
( primary_impact . cost_projection . cost . nanos * power ( 10 , - 9 )), 2 )
end

Use Sheets to explore BigQuery data
As an alternative to executing queries on BigQuery, you can access,
analyze, visualize, and share billions of rows of BigQuery data from
your spreadsheet with Connected Sheets, the new BigQuery data connector.
For more information, refer to Get started with BigQuery data in Google Sheets .
Set up the Export Using BigQuery Command Line & REST API
Get required permissions :
You can get the required Identity and Access Management permissions via the Google Cloud console or command line.
Command Line for Service Accounts
Command Line for Users:
Project level permissions
Organization level permissions
For example, to use Command Line to get organization level recommender.resources.export permission for the service account:
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding *<organization_id>* --member=serviceAccount:*<service_acct_name>*' --role='roles/recommender.exporter'
Create dataset & enable BigQuery API
Enroll project in BigQuery data source
Datasource to use: 6063d10f-0000-2c12-a706-f403045e6250
Create the export:
Using Rest API
Using BigQuery Command Line:
bq mk \
--transfer_config \
--project_id = project_id \
--target_dataset = dataset_id \
--display_name = name \
--params = ' parameters ' \
--data_source = data_source \
--service_account_name = service_account_name
Where:
project_id is your project ID.
dataset is the target dataset id for the transfer configuration.
name is the display name for the transfer configuration. The
transfer name can be any value that allows you to easily identify the
transfer if you need to modify it later.
parameters contains the parameters for the created transfer
configuration in JSON format. For Recommendations and Insights BigQuery Export,
you must supply the organization_id for which recommendations and insights
need to be exported.
Parameters format: '{"organization_id":"<org id>"}'
data_source Datasource to use: '6063d10f-0000-2c12-a706-f403045e6250'
service_account_name is the service account name used for
authenticating your export. The service account should
be owned by the same project_id used for creating the transfer and it
should have all the required permissions listed
above.
Manage an existing export via UI or BigQuery Command Line:
Viewing the export
Working with transfers
Note - the export runs as the user that set up the account, irrespective of who updates the export configuration in future. For example, if the export is set up using a service account, and later a human user updates the export configuration via the BigQuery Data Transfer Service UI, the export will continue to run as the service account. The permission check for 'recommender.resources.export' in this case is done for the service account every time the export runs.
