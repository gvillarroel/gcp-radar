Unattended project recommender
The unattended project recommender analyzes usage activity on projects
in your organization and provides recommendations that help you discover,
reclaim or remove unattended projects.
Overview
In fast-moving organizations, it's not uncommon for cloud resources, including
entire projects, to occasionally be forgotten about. Such unattended resources
can be difficult to identify and tend to result in unnecessary waste and security risks.
Unattended project recommender analyzes usage activity across all projects in
your organization and provides you with the following features to help you
discover, reclaim, and shut down unattended projects:
Usage insights for every project (networking, API, project owner, service activity, and more).
Recommendations to turn down projects having low usage activity.
Recommendations to assign a new owner to projects that have high usage activity but no active owner.
Shutting down or reclaiming unattended projects can provide the following impact and benefits to your organization:
Reduction in security risks ( SECURITY )
Reduction in unnecessary spending ( COST )
Reduction in carbon footprint associated with your workloads ( SUSTAINABILITY )
Note: The unattended project recommender can be used only for projects assigned
to Google Cloud organizations.
How it works
The unattended project recommender analyzes project usage over the last 30 days.
The following table lists the recommendations and insights that the unattended
project recommender can generate based on whether the usage activity is low or high .
Project usage/type
Insight subtype
Recommendation
Recommendation subtype
Projects with:
Low usage for the last 30 days
PROJECT_ACTIVITY
Review or delete the project.
CLEANUP_PROJECT
Projects with:
High usage for the last 30 days
User owners assigned but none of whom are active on the project.
PROJECT_ACTIVITY
Reclaim the project by assigning a new owner.
RECLAIM_PROJECT
All other non-Apps Script projects.
PROJECT_ACTIVITY

-
Note: The unattended project recommender does not generate any insights or
recommendations for Apps Scripts
projects since these projects are auto-deleted upon deletion of the associated scripts.
Recommendations and Insights are available at different levels of your Cloud Organization Hierarchy. Accessing those recommendations and insights requires an IAM role binding at the corresponding level :
At a Project level: Project Owners can discover and act on insights and
recommendations for the projects they have access to.
At an Organizational level: Organization Administrators can discover and act on
insights and recommendations for projects within a cloud organization.
At a Billing Account level: Billing Administrators can discover and act on insights
and recommendations for projects associated with a particular billing account.
Note: The number of Insights and Recommendations per Organization or Billing Account
is currently limited to 10,000. If your Organization or Billing Account includes more than
10,000 projects and you would like to review the full set of recommendations and insights,
we recommend that you either rely on the Project-level insights and recommendations
or use BigQuery export of insights and recommendations .
Ranking the usage activity of a project
A project can be ranked to have a low or high usage activity, based on which
recommendations are provided. The ranking of a project's usage activity is computed
based on the content included in the project's utilization insight .
For projects that are identified to have low usage activity, the following
conditions apply:
Usage classification
Condition
Organizations that have more than 50 projects
A project is ranked based on the level of usage activity across all
content included in the
project's utilization insight .
A project is classified as unattended if it falls within 10% of usage
activity in comparison to all other projects in that organization.
Organizations that have less than 50 projects
Daily average of API calls consumed by a project
( consumedApiDailyCount ) is less than 100.
Cloud logging is the only
service used by a project.
All other project utilization insights have a value equal to zero.
Note: Recommendations are provided only for projects that are older than 30 days.
Recommendation priority and impacts
Unattended project recommendations contain the following fields that help
prioritize and estimate the benefits of applying them:
priority - A priority value between P1-P4, with P1 being the
highest priority.
primaryImpact - SECURITY . The count of high-priority
security recommendations in an unattended project.
additionalImpact(s) - COST and SUSTAINABILITY .
The cost ($) and sustainability emission (kgCO 2 e) reduction that
would be realized if the project was removed.
Recommendation priority
The priority of the unattended project recommendation ranges
from P1 to P4, with P1 being the highest priority.
The recommender begins by reviewing security recommendations in each unattended
project. From there, it sets the priority of the unattended project
recommendation equal to that of the highest priority recommendation found
within the project. For example, if an unattended project has 10 security
recommendations, eight P2 recommendations and two P1 recommendations, the
unattended project recommendation would be assigned a priority value of P1.
The most frequently occurring security recommendations found in unattended
projects are from the
IAM Recommender .
An unattended project recommendation with a priority of P1 likely means there is
a publicly accessible cloud storage bucket in the unattended project
(learn more about
how IAM Recommender sets priorities ).
Security impact
The primaryImpact - SECURITY field offers a
securityProjection equal to the count of high-priority
(P2 and higher) security recommendations in the unattended project.
For example, when a project has a recommendation to replace the broad Editor
role with a more granular role, that recommendation has a
priority of P2
and gets counted in the priorityRecommendationCount .
Cost Impact
The additionalImpact - COST field offers a
costProjection that is an estimate of the cost savings if the
unattended project was removed. This is based on the costs incurred from
resources running in the unattended project over the last 30 days.
Note: To view custom pricing in cost projections, the associated cloud billing
account must not have changed in the last 30 days, and the user must have
billing permissions.
Sustainability impact
The additionalImpact - SUSTAINABILITY field offers
a sustainabilityProjection that is an estimate of
carbon emissions contributed by the
resources running in the unattended project over the last 30 days. The estimate
is measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent (kgCO 2 e).
Contents of a project utilization insight
The contents of a project's utilization insight are field values that are used
to rank the usage activity of the project and generate CLEANUP_PROJECT
and/or RECLAIM_PROJECT recommendations.
Warning: Project utilization insights are generated for all projects, regardless
of whether the project is unattended or not. These insights are generated on a
daily basis. A single insight is not a reliable indicator for
a project to be considered as unattended. Please refrain from removing projects
based on a single day's insight.
The following table lists the various fields that the recommender surfaces as
part of the PROJECT_ACTIVITY insight:
Field
Description
Level of usage
usagePercentile
Percentile of the usage level of this project compared with other
projects within the same organization.
If the percentile is -1, this means that the value is not computed. The

Daily average of carbon emissions contributed by this project based on the last 30 days of data available.
costProjection
Projected cost
savings for the specified duration if the project was to be removed.
A custom or list price is shown based on the billing account permissions.
It is an estimate based on the last 30 days of available data and
does not constitute a bill.
severity
The severity is set to the corresponding value of the
highest severity security insight found in the project. For example,
based on how
IAM Recommender sets severities
for their insights, a CRITICAL severity on the unattended
project insight likely means there is a publicly accessible cloud storage
bucket in the unattended project.
Recommendations to delete a project
A project is recommended for deletion when it has a low usage
in the last 30 days and no OAuth tokens used in the last 180 days.
Warning: Carefully examine the utilization insights associated with a project.
Deleting a project might lead to irreversible data loss. For more information,
refer to Shutting down (deleting) projects . Caution: Recommendations are provided for tenant projects .
Deleting this project might lead to data loss owing to additional project
utilization fields that aren't captured for these projects.
Recommendations to assign a new owner to a project
It is recommended to assign a new owner to a project when it meets all conditions
as listed below:
All assigned owners are either inactive on the project for the last 90 days or
no longer with the company.
The project has a high usage activity.
Note: If a project has no user owner assigned, it is considered as an intended behavior
where the RECLAIM_PROJECT recommendation is not provided.
Pricing
For more details on Active Assist pricing, refer to the recommender
pricing .
Before you begin
Before you can view the insights and recommendations, you must do the following:
You must enable the Recommender API .
You only need to enable the API on a single billing project. You can then use this
same billing project to examine recommendations and insights for other projects, the
entire organization or the billing account, using the --billing-project
functionality of gcloud/API.
Make sure that you have one of these required roles assigned:
Description
Roles
View recommendations
recommender.projectUtilViewer
View and update recommendations
recommender.projectUtilAdmin
Opting-out of insights and recommendations in Transparency and Control Center
dataprocessing.admin
These roles provide a set of permissions
that enable you to access the insights and recommendations. For more information about roles, refer to
understanding roles and
granting IAM permissions .
Granting these roles at the Organization level lets you access the recommendations
and insights for the projects in the organization individually, or
collectively (all unattended projects in the organization) using the Organization level API.
Granting these roles at the Billing Account level lets you access the recommendations
and insights for projects that use the specified billing account.
For more information about opting out,
refer to opting out of insights and recommendations .
Recommender ID
Here are the unattended project recommender ID and insight type:
google.resourcemanager.projectUtilization.Recommender
google.resourcemanager.projectUtilization.Insight
Required IAM permissions
To access the list of recommendations and insights, the following
permissions are required:
recommender.resourcemanagerProjectUtilizationRecommendations.get
recommender.resourcemanagerProjectUtilizationRecommendations.list
recommender.resourcemanagerProjectUtilizationInsights.get
recommender.resourcemanagerProjectUtilizationInsights.list
To update recommendations and insights (for example, to dismiss a recommendation),
the following permissions are required:
recommender.resourcemanagerProjectUtilizationRecommendations.update
recommender.resourcemanagerProjectUtilizationInsights.update
