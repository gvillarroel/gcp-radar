Recent change recommendations

— Recent change recommendations
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Recent change recommendations automatically flag risky changes made recently to
cloud resources identified as important based on their usage and other signals
to help detect and mitigate issues, like service outages, caused by
misconfigurations of those important cloud resources. For example, if you
deleted a highly used project, recent change recommendations can help identify
unintended issues by proactively warning you about the risks associated with a
given change.
Scope
The recent change recommendations only support the resources and actions listed
in the following table.
Resource
Action
Recommendation Scope/Level
Surfaces
Criteria used to determine resource importance
Project

Organization
Google Cloud CLI
Recommender API
Cloud Logging (opt-in)
Project usage (API calls, networking traffic, and Google Cloud services usage)

To provide feedback on this capability overall or request additional resources
and actions you'd like to see supported in future releases, see
Troubleshooting, feedback and support .
Before you begin
Enable the Recommender API on a
single billing project. You can then use this same billing project to
retrieve recommendations and insights for other projects, the entire
organization or the billing account, using the billing-project functionality
of gcloud/API.
Grant permissions on the user or service account that you will be used for
accessing this feature.
Permissions
To view the recommendations for recent change recommendations, you must have the
specific permissions for the recent change recommender.
recommender.cloudRecentChangeRecommendations.get
recommender.cloudRecentChangeRecommendations.list
recommender.cloudRecentChangeInsights.get
recommender.cloudRecentChangeInsights.list
You can also grant
roles/recommender.viewer
role to cover these permissions.

Log recent change recommendations
Optionally, you can use Cloud Logging to create a log whenever a
new recent change recommendation occurs. Note that these logs are
platform logs , so additional charges apply
for such logs. The logging is turned off by default. You must enable logging
using the recommender config to generate logs.
Recommendation type
Logging Scope
Risky project deletion
Organization level
Risky service account deletion
Project level
The logging scope for a recommendation corresponds to the recommendation scope.
You can enable logging for an organization or a project separately. The
recommendation logging config is not inherited from an organization to a project
for this feature. To generate service account deletion recommendations logging,
you must enable logging for the corresponding project.
To viewCloud Logging (if enabled) you need
Logs Viewer permissions.
Logging configuration
To view and update recommender configuration, you must have the following
permissions:
recommender.cloudRecentChangeRecommenderConfig.get
recommender.cloudRecentChangeRecommenderConfig.list
recommender.cloudRecentChangeRecommenderConfig.update
Enable logging
Use the --project flag to enable logging for a project or the --organization
flag to enable logging for an organization. The following examples show how to
enable logging for a project.
Check enable_creation_logs param in the recommenderGenerationConfig :
gcloud recommender recommender-config describe google.cloud.RecentChangeRecommender \
--project = PROJECT_ID --location = global
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The project ID of a project where you've
enabled the Recommender API.
The output is similar to the following:
<pre class="console">
etag: '"******"'
recommenderGenerationConfig:
params:
enable_creation_logs: false
…
</pre>
Create a config.txt ` file that contains the following lines:
{
"params": {
"enable_creation_logs": true
}
}
Update the param:
gcloud recommender recommender-config update google.cloud.RecentChangeRecommender \
--project = PROJECT_ID --location = global --config-file = config.txt \
--etag = " ETAG "
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The project ID of a project where you've
enabled the Recommender API.
ETAG : Where ETAG is the value from the
previous describe command.
