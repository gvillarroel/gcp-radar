Standard
When you enable the Backup for GKE agent in your Google Kubernetes Engine cluster,
Backup for GKE provides a CustomResourceDefinition that introduces a new kind of Kubernetes
resource: the ProtectedApplication .
Composing a ProtectedApplication involves three activities:
Selecting the set of resources that you want to
backup and restore as part of the application.
Defining detailed orchestration rules for
a subset of those resources.
Validating the ProtectedApplication to check if it is
ready for backup.
ProtectedApplication resources provide you with these capabilities when
customizing backup and restore logic at the application level:
More fine-grained backup and restore operations. Without
ProtectedApplications , the scope of your backups must be defined at the
Namespace level (either by selecting
allNamespaces
or
selectedNamespaces ).
Similar logic applies to namespaced resource restoration. Creating
ProtectedApplication resources allows you to supply a name to a subset of
the resources in a Namespace . You can then backup and restore that subset
by listing selectedApplications
in your backup scope (and similarly, for restore ).
Orchestrating fine-grained details of the backup or restore process, including:
Skipping selected volumes during backup.
Incorporating application topology into backup and restore (for
example, only backing up one instance of a replicated database and using it
to restore multiple instances).
Executing user-defined hooks before and after volumes are snapshotted.
These can be used, for example, to flush and quiesce a workload before
snapshotting and unquiesce it afterwards.
You create ProtectedApplication by using kubectl like other Kubernetes resources.
They are completely optional. If ProtectedApplication resources are not
present, Backup for GKE creates volume backups for all volumes within the
scope of a backup and the resulting volume backups will be crash consistent -
all writes flushed to the disk at a particular point in time will be captured
(i.e., no partial writes). However, some applications may keep data in
memory that isn't flushed to disk, so whether or not an application can recover
successfully from a crash consistent backup depends upon the application logic.
Selecting resources
The first step in building your ProtectedApplication resource is to identify
the other resources in the same Namespace that you want to include as part
of the application. This is the set of resources that will be backed up or
restored if you supply the
selectedApplications
scope option in your BackupPlan configuration.
Resources are identified using a label
selector .
This requires that you label all your resources (using the metadata.label field
in each resource) with the same label. Note that this
also applies to resources that are automatically created by controllers. These
auto-created resources are labeled using their corresponding template.
Note that it is common to re-use the same label you are already using to
associate generated Pods and PersistentVolumeClaims with their parent
resource.
Usage considerations include the following:
If you want to protect resources that create child resources, then both
parent resources (like StatefulSet , Deployment , or DaemonSet ) and child
resources (like Pod or PersistentVolumeClaim ) must both have the label
that is used in the Selector field of the ProtectedApplication .
If some of the resources referenced by your
ProtectedApplication are created automatically by an operator,
you should also include the operator's custom resources in your
ProtectedApplication selector. This will help avoid a restore-time
race condition that can occur when the operator attempts to create a
resource while it is simultaneously being restored from backup.
The following example shows how you can apply the app: nginx label to the
other resources in addition to the Deployment .
apiVersion : v1
kind : ConfigMap
metadata :
name : nginx-vars
namespace : webserver
labels :
app : nginx
data :
...
---
apiVersion : v1
kind : PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata :
name : nginx-logs
namespace : webserver
labels :
app : nginx
spec :
accessModes :
- ReadWriteOnce
resources :
requests :
storage : 50Mi
storageClassName : standard-rwo
---
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : nginx-deployment
namespace : webserver
labels :
app : nginx
spec :
replicas : 1
selector :
matchLabels :
app : nginx
template :
metadata :
labels :
app : nginx
spec :
volumes :
- name : nginx-logs
persistentVolumeClaim :
claimName : nginx-logs
containers :
...
Once you have your selected label applied to all your target resources (and the
templates from which additional resources are generated), then you can
reference those resources from a ProtectedApplication . For example:
kind : ProtectedApplication
apiVersion : gkebackup.gke.io/v1
metadata :
name : nginx
namespace : webserver
spec :
resourceSelection :
type : Selector
selector :
matchLabels :
app : nginx
...
Define orchestration rules
Once you have all the resources in your ProtectedApplication identified, you
can choose to define detailed orchestration rules for a subset of these
resources. These rules may only apply to two kinds of resources:
Deployments
and StatefulSets and are
referenced in the components section of the ProtectedApplication .
Component overview
Configuring a component involves the following:
Selecting a fundamental strategy for how backup and restore will work for
this component. There are three strategies available:
BackupAllRestoreAll - backup the volumes associated with all instances of
the component and restore them all from the backups.
BackupOneRestoreAll - backup the volumes from only one instance of the
component and use those backups to restore all instances.
DumpAndLoad - export data from the application to a single volume at backup
time and import that data into the application at restore time.
Defining execution hooks to run during backup (and possibly
restore, depending on the strategy). A hook is a command that is executed in
specific containers.
Selecting a subset of volumes to backup .
Execution hooks
A hook is a shell command that Backup for GKE executes in a container at
particular phase of the backup or restore process.
There are four different types of hooks:
pre hooks - these commands are executed right before volumes are backed up
and are generally expected to flush any data in memory to disk and
then quiesce the application so that no new disk writes are occurring. These
hooks are used in the BackupAllRestoreAll
and BackupOneRestoreAll strategies.
post hooks - these commands are executed during the volume backup process
right after the SNAPSHOTTING step of the volume backup process (before the
UPLOADING step). Generally, the SNAPSHOTTING step takes just a few seconds.
They are generally expected to unquiesce the application (i.e. allow
normal processing and disk writes to proceed).
These hooks are used in the BackupAllRestoreAll ,
BackupOneRestoreAll , and DumpAndLoad
strategies.
dump hooks - these commands are executed before the volume is backed up in
the DumpAndLoad strategy and are generally expected to export
data from the application into the designated backup volume.
load hooks - these commands are executed at restore time after the backup
volume is restored in DumpAndLoad strategy cases. They are
generally expected to import the data from the backup volume into the
application.
You may provide more than one hook for each type and Backup for GKE will
execute them in the order you define them.
You define hooks as part of the component section of the
ProtectedApplication specification. All hook definitions have the same
available fields:
name - a name you assign to the hook.
container - (optional) name of container to run command in. If you don't
supply the container, Backup for GKE will run the hook in the first
container defined for the target Pod (s).
command - this is the actual command sent into the container, constructed
as an array of words. The first word in the array is the path to the
command and subsequent words are the arguments to be passed to the command.
timeoutSeconds - (optional) time before hook execution is aborted.
If you don't supply this, then it defaults to 30 seconds.
onError - (optional) behavior taken when the hook fails. May be set to Ignore or Fail (default).
If you set this to Fail , then when a hook fails, the volume backup will fail. If you set
this to Ignore , failures of this hook are ignored.
Before applying ProtectedApplication hooks to your application, you should test the command
by using kubectl exec
to ensure that the hooks behave as expected:
kubectl exec POD_NAME -- COMMAND
Replace the following:
POD_NAME : the name of the Pod that contains the ProtectedApplication resource.
COMMAND : the array containing the command that you want to run in the container.
Selecting a subset of volumes to backup
Sometimes, applications write to volumes that are not interesting to restore
(for example, certain log or scratch volumes). You can suppress the
backup of these volumes by using a volume selector .
To use this feature, you must first apply a common label to the
PersistentVolumeClaim resources of volumes you want to backup. You must also
leave this label off of the PersistentVolumeClaim resources of volumes you
do not want backed up. Then, you include a volumeSelector clause in your
component definition as follows:
spec :
...
components :
...
strategy :
...
volumeSelector :
matchLabels :
label_name : label_value
If you supply a volumeSelector for a component, then only the volumes whose
PersistentVolumeClaim resources have the given label are backed up and
restored. At restore time, any other volumes are provisioned as empty
instead of restored from a volume backup.
Strategy: BackupAllRestoreAll
This is the simplest strategy and backs up all the component's volumes
at backup time and restores them all from their volume backups at restore time.
It is your best choice when your application has no replication between Pods .
This strategy supports the following parameters:
backupPreHooks - (optional) an ordered list of hooks that are
executed right before volumes are backed up. These commands are executed on
all Pods in the component.
backupPostHooks - (optional) an ordered list of hooks that are
executed after volume backups have reached the UPLOADING phase. These commands are
executed on all Pods in the component.
volumeSelector - (optional) logic for matching a subset of volumes to
backup .
This example creates a ProtectedApplication resource that quiesces the
file system before backing up the logs volume and unquiesces after the backup:
kind : ProtectedApplication
apiVersion : gkebackup.gke.io/v1
metadata :
name : nginx
namespace : sales
spec :
resourceSelection :
type : Selector
selector :
matchLabels :
app : nginx
components :
- name : nginx-app
resourceKind : Deployment
resourceNames : [ "nginx-deployment" ]
strategy :
type : BackupAllRestoreAll
backupAllRestoreAll :
backupPreHooks :
- name : freeze
container : nginx
command :
- bash
- "-c"
- |
# Add application logic to flush data to disk before snapshot
# and freeze the application from further changes.
echo "Freezing the application"
# Return 0 on successful freeze of application, and non-zero
# for errors
exit 0
backupPostHooks :
- name : unfreeze
container : nginx
command :
- bash
- "-c"
- |
# Add application logic to unfreeze the application.
echo "Unfreezing the application"
# Return 0 on successful freeze of application, and non-zero
# for errors
exit 0
Strategy: BackupOneAndRestoreAll
This strategy backs up one copy of a selected Pod. This single copy is
the source for restoring all Pods during a restore. This method can help reduce
storage cost and backup time. This strategy works in a high availability configuration
when a component is deployed with one primary PersistentVolumeClaim and multiple
secondary PersistentVolumeClaims .
This strategy supports the following parameters:
backupTargetName - (required) specifies which Deployment or StatefulSet that you want to use to back up the data.
The best Pod to back up is automatically selected. In a high availability configuration,
we recommend that you set this to one of your application replicas.
backupPreHooks - (optional) an ordered list of hooks that are
executed right before volumes are backed up. These commands are executed only
on the selected backup Pod .
backupPostHooks - (optional) an ordered list of hooks that are
executed after volume backups have reached the UPLOADING phase. These commands are executed only
on the selected backup Pod .
volumeSelector - (optional) logic for matching a subset of volumes to
backup .
If a component is configured with multiple Deployments or StatefulSets, all
resources must have the same PersistentVolume structure, meaning they must follow
these rules:
The number of PersistentVolumeClaims used by all Deployments or StatefulSets must be the same.
The purpose of PersistentVolumeClaims in the same index must be the same. For StatefulSets, the
index is defined in the volumeClaimTemplate . For Deployments, the index is defined in Volumes
and any non-persistent volumes are skipped.
If the application component consists of Deployments, each Deployment must have exactly one replica.
Given these considerations, multiple volume sets can be selected for backup,
but only one volume from each volume set will be selected.
This example, assuming an architecture of one primary StatefulSet and a secondary StatefulSet,
shows a backup of volumes of one Pod in secondary StatefulSet, and then a restore to all other volumes:
kind : ProtectedApplication
apiVersion : gkebackup.gke.io/v1
metadata :
name : mariadb
namespace : mariadb
spec :
resourceSelection :
type : Selector
selector :
matchLabels :
app : mariadb
components :
- name : mariadb
resourceKind : StatefulSet
resourceNames : [ "mariadb-primary" , "mariadb-secondary" ]
strategy :
type : BackupOneRestoreAll
backupOneRestoreAll :
backupTargetName : mariadb-secondary
backupPreHooks :
- name : quiesce
container : mariadb
command : [ ... ]
backupPostHooks :
- name : unquiesce
container : mariadb
command : [ ... ]
Strategy: DumpAndLoad
This strategy uses a dedicated volume for backup and restore processes
and requires a dedicated PersistentVolumeClaim attached to a component that stores
dump data.
This strategy supports the following parameters:
dumpTarget - (required) specifies which Deployment or StatefulSet that you want to use
to back up the data. The best Pod to back up is automatically selected. In a high
availability configuration, we recommend that you set this to one of your application replicas.
loadTarget - (required) specifies which Deployment or StatefulSet should be used to load the data.
The best Pod to back up is automatically selected. The load target does not have
to be the same as the dump target.
dumpHooks - (required) an ordered list of hooks that are
executed to populate the dedicated backup volume. These commands are only executed
on the selected dump Pod .
backupPostHooks - (optional) an ordered list of hooks that are
executed after volume backups have reached the UPLOADING phase. These commands are executed only
on the selected dump Pod .
loadHooks - (required) an ordered list of hooks that
are executed to load the data from the restored volume after the application
starts. These commands are executed only on the selected load Pod .
volumeSelector - (required) logic for matching a single volume to backup
and restore (the "dump" volume). Though it must only match a single volume,
you configure this the same way you do the subset of volumes to
backup used by other strategies.
If the application consists of Deployments, each Deployment must have exactly one replica.
This example, assuming an architecture of one primary StatefulSet and a secondary StatefulSet
with dedicated PersistentVolumeClaims for both primary and secondary StatefulSets,
shows a DumpAndLoad strategy:
kind : ProtectedApplication
apiVersion : gkebackup.gke.io/v1
metadata :
name : mariadb
namespace : mariadb
spec :
resourceSelection :
type : Selector
selector :
matchLabels :
app : mariadb
components :
- name : mariadb-dump
resourceKind : StatefulSet
resourceNames : [ "mariadb-primary" , "mariadb-secondary" ]
strategy :
type : DumpAndLoad
dumpAndLoad :
loadTarget : mariadb-primary
dumpTarget : mariadb-secondary
dumpHooks :
- name : db_dump
container : mariadb
command :
- bash
- "-c"
- |
mysqldump -u root --all-databases > /backup/mysql_backup.dump
loadHooks :
- name : db_load
container : mariadb
command :
- bash
- "-c"
- |
mysql -u root < /backup/mysql_backup.sql
volumeSelector :
matchLabels :
gkebackup.gke.io/backup : dedicated-volume
Check if a ProtectedApplication is ready for backup
You can check whether a ProtectedApplication is ready for a backup by running
the following command:
kubectl describe protectedapplication APPLICATION_NAME
Replace APPLICATION_NAME with the name of your application.
If ready, the application description will show Ready to backup status as true ,
such as in this example:
% kubectl describe protectedapplication nginx
Name: nginx
Namespace: default
API Version: gkebackup.gke.io/v1
Kind: ProtectedApplication
