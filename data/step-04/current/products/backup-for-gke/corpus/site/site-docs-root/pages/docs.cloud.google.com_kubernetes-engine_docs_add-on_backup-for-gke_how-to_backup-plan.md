This page describes how to create a Backup for GKE backup plan, which is used
for backing up your workloads in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
Backup plans provide the configuration, location, and management functions for
a sequence of backups. A backup plan contains a backup configuration including
the source cluster, the selection of which workloads to back up, and the region
in which backup artifacts produced under this plan are stored.
You can create one or more backup plans for each cluster. There are two main
reasons why you might want more than one backup plan for a cluster:
You want to store your backup artifacts in multiple regions. In this
case, create a backup plan for each region in which you want to store backups.
You want to partition the backups of your cluster, for example:
Instead of one very large backup taken at a single time of
the day, you want multiple smaller backups distributed throughout the day.
You want to back up some portions of your cluster more often
than others (such as daily backups for some namespaces and hourly
backups for others).
We recommend that every cluster has at least one backup plan.
Backup for GKE doesn't support backing up a cluster from one project to
another. You can only create a backup plan to a cluster within the same project
where the cluster is created.
You can create a backup plan with a backup scheduling method to automatically
create backups: smart scheduling or cron scheduling. We recommend
smart scheduling for your backup plan. This ensures backups are automatically created
to meet the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) requirements.
For more information, see Automatic backup creation and deletion .
If you don't want to create a backup plan with backup scheduling methods,
you need to manually back up
your workloads. After creating a backup plan, you can create a backup from
that plan.
Before you begin
Enable Backup for GKE API
Enable Backup for GKE for a cluster
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create and manage a backup plan,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Backup for GKE Backup Admin ( roles/gkebackup.backupAdmin ), which is a subset of Backup for GKE Admin ( roles/gkebackup.admin )
IAM role on your project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Create a backup plan
Create a backup plan by using the gcloud CLI or the Google Cloud console.
Note: This will automatically install the Backup for GKE
agent
in the specified cluster. Installing the agent can take several minutes.
gcloud
To create a backup plan with a schedule, run the following command:
gcloud beta container backup-restore backup-plans create BACKUP_PLAN_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = BACKUP_LOCATION \
--cluster = CLUSTER \
--all-namespaces \
--include-secrets \
--include-volume-data \
--encryption-key = ENCRYPTION_KEY \
--target-rpo-minutes = TARGET_RPO_MINUTES \
--exclusion-windows-file = EXCLUSION_WINDOWS_FILE \
--cron-schedule = CRON_SCHEDULE \
--backup-retain-days = RETAIN_DAYS \
--backup-delete-lock-days = DELETE_LOCK_DAYS \
--locked
Replace the following:
BACKUP_PLAN_NAME : the name of the backup plan that you want to create.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud
project.
BACKUP_LOCATION : the
compute region
for the resource, for example us-central1 . See About
resource locations .
CLUSTER : the relative path to the cluster:
Regional clusters: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /clusters/ CLUSTER_NAME
Zonal clusters: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /clusters/ CLUSTER_NAME
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster to back up.
--all-namespaces : backs up all namespaces for the cluster.
Alternatively, specify:
--selected-applications with a list of
ProtectedApplications
as NAMESPACE1/APP1 , NAMESPACE2/APP2 ,...
to back up.
--selected-namespaces with a list of namespaces as
NAMESPACE1 , NAMESPACE2 ,...
to back up.
You must specify one of these options when creating a backup plan.
--include-secrets : an optional argument to include Secret resources if they are
in the scope of the backup.
--include-volume-data : an optional argument to include persistent volume data in
the backup. Don't set this argument if you want to create empty volumes during
restore.
ENCRYPTION_KEY : an optional argument to define the path to a
customer-managed encryption key. See About CMEK encryption .
TARGET_RPO_MINUTES : required argument
if EXCLUSION_WINDOWS_FILE is set. Specify the
target RPO in minutes.
Smart scheduling uses this value to automatically create backups.
The minimum is 60 minutes (1 hour) and maximum is 86400 minutes (60 days).
You can't set both TARGET_RPO_MINUTES and
CRON_SCHEDULE simultaneously in one backup plan.
EXCLUSION_WINDOWS_FILE : an optional argument to
define time windows during which backup cannot happen. All times are
interpreted as UTC. This argument is available only when
TARGET_RPO_MINUTES is set.
Note: Backup jobs are scheduled to start and finish outside the window
duration as much as possible, but ongoing jobs won't be canceled if an
exclusion window begins when jobs are in progress.
CRON_SCHEDULE : an optional argument to define a cron schedule that
automatically creates backups and supports standard cron
syntax. For example "10 3 * * *" creates a backup at 3:10 AM every day. All
times are interpreted as UTC. The minimum interval between scheduled
backups is 10 minutes. You can't set both CRON_SCHEDULE
and TARGET_RPO_MINUTES simultaneously in one backup plan.
RETAIN_DAYS : required argument if
TARGET_RPO_MINUTES or CRON_SCHEDULE
is set. Specify the number of days to retain the backup. Backups for this plan are
automatically deleted after the retention period expires.
DELETE_LOCK_DAYS : an optional argument to specify the number of days
during which backups cannot be deleted. If this value is set, then
backups created for that plan cannot be deleted (either automatically or
manually) until that lifetime expires.
Caution: If you have a delete lock on a backup, you cannot delete that
backup, the plan that contains the backup, or the project that
contains the plan, until the lock expires.
--locked : an optional argument to lock the retention policy for the backup plan.
For the full list of options, refer to the
gcloud beta container backup-restore backup-plans create
documentation.
Create a backup plan for all namespaces with a RPO of 24 hours and a single exclusion window

--locked
Create a backup plan for a selected namespace with an hourly cron schedule
The following command creates a backup plan to schedule hourly backup for
the selected namespace ( my-ns ) at minute 15 every hour. Backups are
retained for three days after creation:
gcloud beta container backup-restore backup-plans create BACKUP_PLAN \
--location = LOCATION \
--cluster = CLUSTER \
--selected-namespaces = my-ns \
--include-secrets \
--include-volume-data \
--cron-schedule = "15 * * * *" \
--backup-retain-days = 3
Create a backup plan for a selected ProtectedApplication
The following command creates a backup plan to select the
ProtectedApplication
( my-ns/my-app ).
gcloud beta container backup-restore backup-plans create BACKUP_PLAN \
--location = LOCATION \
--cluster = CLUSTER \
--selected-applications = my-ns1/my-app1,my-ns2/my-app2 \
--include-secrets \

Expand the cluster and click the plan name.
Click the Details tab to see the plan details.
Update a backup plan
You can update the backup plan information, such as its description, backup scope,
backup mode, encryption, or backup schedule. You can also modify the retention
policy of the backup plan, such as how long to retain the backups or the period of
time during which backups cannot be deleted.
Note: Any updates to the backup plan apply only to backups created after the
backup plan is updated. Updates to the backup plan don't affect existing backups.
Update a backup plan by using the gcloud CLI or the
Google Cloud console.
gcloud
To update a backup plan, for example by adding a new description, run the
following command:
gcloud beta container backup-restore backup-plans update BACKUP_PLAN \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = LOCATION \
--description = DESCRIPTION
For the full list of options, refer to the
gcloud beta container backup-restore backup-plans update
documentation.
Console
Use the following instructions to update a backup plan in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Google Kubernetes Engine page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Google Kubernetes Engine
In the navigation menu, click Backup for GKE .
Click the Backup Plans tab.
Expand the cluster and click the plan name.
Click the Details tab to edit the plan details.
Click edit Edit to
edit a plan section and click Save changes .
Pause a backup schedule
Backup plans can be paused manually or automatically to pause the backup schedules.
When the backup plan is paused, automatic backups aren't created. However,
you can still create manual backups. For instructions, see
Create a manual backup .
Manual pause : You can manually pause a backup plan using Google Cloud console,
gcloud, or terraform.
Automatic pause : Backup for GKE can automatically pause a backup plan in
the following scenarios:
When initiating a backup (scheduled or manual), if any of the following errors occur:
StatusInvalidCluster : The StatusInvalidCluster error indicates
an unrecoverable condition where the cluster name is invalid or metadata
information of the cluster is unavailable.
GKEMetadataNotEnabledOnNodepool : The GKEMetadataNotEnabledOnNodepool
error represents an unrecoverable condition where the cluster has
Workload Identity Federation for GKE enabled, but GKE_METADATA is not configured on
any node pool, preventing the agent from functioning correctly.
AgentNotInstalled : The AgentNotInstalled error indicates an
unrecoverable condition where the cluster doesn't have the necessary
agent custom resource definitions installed, implying improper
agent installation.
If a backup remains in the Creating phase for an hour, it might indicate
connectivity issues between the cluster and Google Cloud or agent
misconfiguration.
To prevent repeated backup failures, the backup plan might be automatically paused
if it exhibits a pattern of prolonged or frequent unsuccessful backup attempts.
This situation typically occurs when the system detects a significant period
without a
successful backup or a consistent series of recent failures, which indicates a
persistent underlying issue.
If the backup plan was paused due to backup failures, you can troubleshoot
the backup failure issue by checking the Current RPO risk field on the
Backup plan details page and the Status reason field on the recent
failed backups. If the pause is unintentional and the issue is resolved,
resume the backup plan to continue automatic backups.
You can set up alerts for paused backup plans and unpause them when the
underlying issues are fixed. For instructions, see
Set up alerts for paused backup plans .
gcloud
To pause a backup schedule, run the following command:
gcloud beta container backup-restore backup-plans update BACKUP_PLAN \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
