Standard
This page describes how to use VPC Service Controls to protect Backup for GKE
resources. For more information about VPC Service Controls, read the Overview of VPC Service Controls .
Before you begin
Ensure that you have the required IAM permissions to
administer VPC Service Controls.
Create a service perimeter to protect Backup for GKE resources
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC Service Controls page.
Go to VPC Service Controls
If you are prompted, select your Organization.
On the VPC Service Controls page, click New Perimeter .
On the New VPC Service Perimeter page, in the Perimeter Name box,
type a name for the perimeter.
Select the projects that you want to secure within the perimeter:
Click Add Projects button.
To add a project to the perimeter, in the Add Projects dialog, select that project's checkbox.
Click Add n Projects button, where n is
the number of projects you selected in the previous step.
Select Backup for GKE to secure within the perimeter:
Click Add Services button.
To secure Backup for GKE within the perimeter, in the
Specify services to restrict dialog, select Backup for GKE's
checkbox.
Click Add Backup for GKE API button.
Click Save button.
You've created a service perimeter that restricts access to Backup for GKE
resources. The service perimeter may take up to 30 minutes to propagate and take
effect. When the changes have propagated, access to Backup for GKE will be
limited for the projects you added to the perimeter. For example, no backup plan
or backup can be created from outside of the perimeter, unless otherwise explicitly allowed by an ingress rule.
Details about how Backup for GKE works with service perimeters
If Backup for GKE is not among the list of VPC accessible services of a
service perimeter, backup and restore may fail even if you are able to create
backup or restore using the Google Cloud console or gcloud CLI. This
is because the Backup for GKE agent is running in your GKE
cluster (within the service perimeter) and requires access to
Backup for GKE to perform backup and restore.
To perform cross-project backups and restores successfully, the
backup_project , cluster_project , and restore_project should be within
the same VPC Service Controls perimeter.
