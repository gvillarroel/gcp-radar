Standard
This page describes how to create a Backup for GKE restore plan, which is used
for restoring your backups in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
Restore plans are pre-configured restore scenarios for a corresponding line of
backups.
Restore plans can assign permissions for administrators to use these
configurations. Those users can quickly and independently restore a backup when
an incident occurs. For example, persistent data might be corrupted by a
software update in a deployed application, putting the application namespace in
an invalid state, which requires a restore.
Backup for GKE doesn't support restoring a backup from one project to another.
You can only restore backups to clusters within the same project that the backup
originated from. Restore plans cannot reference backup plans in a different
project.
During restoration, you can optionally apply transformation rules, which are
used to match a set of resources and substitute the current value of an
attribute on those resources for a new value.
Note: Restoration is subject to a maximum GKE version difference
constraint. Specifically, the target cluster version must be between the backup
cluster version and the backup cluster version + 3 minor versions, inclusive.
For example, a backup that was produced from a cluster running
GKE 1.28 can only be restored to a cluster running 1.28 through
1.31.
Managed namespaces
Backup for GKE does not restore into managed namespaces. These namespaces are
silently skipped during restore. The list of managed namespaces include the
following:
cnrm-system
configconnector-operator-system
gatekeeper-system
gke-connect
gke-gmp-system
gmp-public
kube-node-lease
kube-public
kube-system
Namespaces with the following label:
Key: addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode
Value: Reconcile or EnsureExists
Before you begin
Plan a set of backups .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create and manage a restore plan,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Backup for GKE Restore Admin ( roles/gkebackup.restoreAdmin ), which is a subset of Backup for GKE Admin ( roles/gkebackup.admin )
IAM role on your project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Create a restore plan
You can create a restore plan for your backups by using the Google Cloud CLI or
the Google Cloud console.
Note: This will automatically install the Backup for GKE
agent
in the specified cluster.
gcloud
To create a restore plan, run the following command:
gcloud beta container backup-restore restore-plans create RESTORE_PLAN \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = RESTORE_LOCATION \
--backup-plan = projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ BACKUP_LOCATION /backupPlans/ BACKUP_PLAN_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER \
--namespaced-resource-restore-mode = NAMESPACED_RESOURCE_RESTORE_MODE \
--all-namespaces \
--cluster-resource-conflict-policy = CLUSTER_RESOURCE_CONFLICT_POLICY \
--cluster-resource-scope-selected-group-kinds = CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SCOPE \
--volume-data-restore-policy = VOLUME_DATA_RESTORE_POLICY
Replace the following:
RESTORE_PLAN : the name of the restore plan that you want to create.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud
project.
RESTORE_LOCATION : the
compute region
for the resource, for example us-central1 . See About
resource locations .
The location must be the same region where the target cluster is located.
BACKUP_PLAN : the source of backups that can be
restored with this restore plan:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ BACKUP_LOCATION /backupPlans/ BACKUP_PLAN_NAME
Ensure that the backup plan is in the same project as the new restore plan.
CLUSTER : the name of the target cluster to which you want
to restore the backup:
Regional clusters: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /clusters/ CLUSTER_NAME
Zonal clusters: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /clusters/ CLUSTER_NAME
NAMESPACED_RESOURCE_RESTORE_MODE : defines how to
handle restore-time conflicts for namespaced resources. Namespaced
resources are always restored in groups, either by namespace or by
ProtectedApplication . Use one of these options:
merge-skip-on-conflict : skip the individual conflicting resources.
merge-replace-volume-on-conflict : skip the individual conflicting resources but replace the underlying persistent volume data.
merge-replace-on-conflict : replace the individual conflicting resources and underlying persistent volume data.
delete-and-restore : When the target cluster contains the same
group of resources that are targeted for restore to the cluster,
the existing group of resources is deleted before the new resources
are restored.
fail-on-conflict : If any groups of resources targeted for restore
from a backup already exist in the target cluster, the restore will
fail.
--all-namespaces : restores all namespaced resources in the backup.
Alternatively, specify:
--excluded-namespaces with a list of namespaces as NAMESPACE1 , NAMESPACE2 ,...
to restore all namespaces except the ones in the list.
--selected-applications with a list of
ProtectedApplications
as NAMESPACE1/APP1 , NAMESPACE2/APP2 ,...
to restore.
--selected-namespaces with a list of namespaces as
NAMESPACE1 , NAMESPACE2 ,...
to restore.
--no-namespaces restores no namespaced resources in the backup.
This option cannot be specified together with
--cluster-resource-scope-no-group-kinds .
You must specify one of these options when creating a restore plan.
Caution: Backup for GKE does not restore resources into
managed namespaces . These namespaces
are silently skipped during a restore process. Listing them explicitly
results in an error.
CLUSTER_RESOURCE_CONFLICT_POLICY : defines how to
handle restore-time conflicts for selected cluster resources. Use one of
these options:
use-existing-version : If the resources that are being restored
already exist in the target cluster, Backup for GKE keeps the
existing resources.
use-backup-version : If the resources that are being restored
already exist in the target cluster, Backup for GKE replaces the
existing resources with the new resources from the backup.
Warning: this is a dangerous option which could cause unintentional
data loss if used inappropriately. For example, deleting a CRD will
cause Kubernetes to delete all CRs of that type.
--cluster-resource-scope-selected-group-kinds : (Optional) restores
cluster resources with selected group kinds in the format Group/Kind .
CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SCOPE defines GroupKinds
of cluster resources to be restored. For example,
apiextension.k8s.io/CustomResourceDefinition,storage.k8s.io/StorageClass .
Alternatively, specify:
cluster-resource-scope-all-group-kinds to select all cluster
resource group kinds to restore.
cluster-resource-scope-excluded-group-kinds with a list of cluster
resource group kinds to restore all cluster resource group kinds
except those in the list.
cluster-resource-scope-no-group-kinds . This option cannot be
specified together with --no-namespaces .
Not specifying any of these options won't restore any cluster resources.
Caution: Backup for GKE is not allowed to select cluster-scoped resources
that are managed by GKE clusters or driven by restore configuration
elsewhere. Such GroupKinds include Namespace , Node , PersistentVolume ,
gkebackup.gke.io/BackupJob , gkebackup.gke.io/RestoreJob ,
metrics.k8s.io/NodeMetrics , migration.k8s.io/StorageState ,
migration.k8s.io/StorageVersionMigration ,
snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshotContent , storage.k8s.io/CSINode .
Selecting cluster-resource-scope-all-group-kinds automatically skips
these cluster-scoped resources. Listing them explicitly results in an
error.
VOLUME_DATA_RESTORE_POLICY : defines how data is
populated for restored volumes. Use one of these options:
restore-volume-data-from-backup : New PVs will be restored using
the corresponding volume backup data in the Backup.
reuse-volume-handle-from-backup : PVs will be pre-provisioned
using the volume handle of the original PV in the Backup.
no-volume-data-restoration : PVs won't be restored. The
restoration only restores selected PVCs and expects the
corresponding storage driver to either dynamically provision blank
PVs or bind them to pre-provisioned PVs created out-of-band.
For the full list of options, refer to the
gcloud beta container backup-restore restore-plans create
documentation.
Create a restore plan for all namespaces
The following command creates a restore plan to restore all namespaces
and cluster resources:
gcloud beta container backup-restore restore-plans create RESTORE_PLAN \
--location = LOCATION \
--backup-plan = projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ BACKUP_LOCATION /backupPlans/ BACKUP_PLAN_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER \
--namespaced-resource-restore-mode = fail-on-conflict \
--all-namespaces \
--cluster-resource-conflict-policy = use-existing-version \
--cluster-resource-scope-all-group-kinds \
--volume-data-restore-policy = restore-volume-data-from-backup
Create a restore plan to roll back a namespace
The following command creates a restore plan to roll back the
namespace my-ns from backup:
gcloud beta container backup-restore restore-plans create RESTORE_PLAN \
--location = LOCATION \
--backup-plan = projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ BACKUP_LOCATION /backupPlans/ BACKUP_PLAN_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER \
--namespaced-resource-restore-mode = delete-and-restore \
--selected-namespaces = my-ns \
--cluster-resource-conflict-policy = use-existing-version \
--cluster-resource-scope-selected-group-kinds = apiextension.k8s.io/CustomResourceDefinition,storage.k8s.io/StorageClass \
--volume-data-restore-policy = restore-volume-data-from-backup
Create a restore plan to roll back a ProtectedApplication to reconnect original volumes
The following command creates a restore plan to roll back the
protected application my-ns/my-app to reconnect original volumes:
gcloud beta container backup-restore restore-plans create RESTORE_PLAN \
--location = LOCATION \
--backup-plan = projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ BACKUP_LOCATION /backupPlans/ BACKUP_PLAN_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER \
--namespaced-resource-restore-mode = delete-and-restore \
--selected-applications = my-ns/my-app \
--cluster-resource-conflict-policy = use-existing-version \
--cluster-resource-scope-no-group-kinds \
--volume-data-restore-policy = reuse-volume-handle-from-backup
Create a restore plan to restore cluster resources only
The following command creates a restore plan to restore all cluster resources:
gcloud beta container backup-restore restore-plans create RESTORE_PLAN \
--location = LOCATION \
--backup-plan = projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ BACKUP_LOCATION /backupPlans/ BACKUP_PLAN_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER \
--namespaced-resource-restore-mode = fail-on-conflict \
--no-namespaces \
--cluster-resource-conflict-policy = use-existing-version \
--cluster-resource-scope-all-group-kinds
Console
Use the following instructions to create a restore plan in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Google Kubernetes Engine page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Google Kubernetes Engine
In the navigation menu, click Backup for GKE .
Click Create a restore plan .
In the Name your plan and choose a cluster section, complete the
following and click Next :
Enter the restore plan name and optional description.
Choose a backup plan for an existing cluster that corresponds to the
backups that you want to restore.
Choose the target cluster where you want to restore the backup.
In the Choose namespaced resources section, complete the following
and click Next :
Choose what namespaces to restore:
Click All namespaced resources to restore all
namespaced resources in the backup.
Click Add namespaces under the Exceptions section to exclude
any namespace in the backup.
Click Selected namespaced resources to specify the
namespaces in the backup to restore.
Click Selected protected applications to add
resources by specifying the namespace and application name.
Click No namespaced resources to not restore any namespaced
resources.
Caution: Backup for GKE does not restore resources into managed namespaces such as kube-system , kube-public , or kube-node-lease . These namespaces are silently skipped during a restore process. Listing them explicitly will result in an error.
Choose how to handle conflicts if any namespaced resources are
selected:
Click Merge skip (non-destructive) if a specific resource
already exists, skip restoring the resource from the backup.
Click Merge replace volume (destructive) if a specific resource
already exists, skip restoring that resource but replace the
underlying persistent volume using the volume data restore policy.
The merge replace volume achieves the data-only restore.
Click Merge replace (destructive) if a specific resource already
exists, replace that resource with the one from backup and the
associated volume data by following the volume data restore policy.
Click Fail on conflict (non-destructive) to fail
the restore if any namespaces targeted for restore from a backup
already exist in the target cluster.
Click Rollback (destructive) to delete the existing
namespaces before restoring the new namespaces if any namespaces
targeted for restore from a backup already exist in the target
cluster.
Choose how to restore volume data and click Next :
Click Provision new volumes and restore volume data
from backup to restore volume data from the backup on a new
persistent disk.
Click Don't restore volume data to provision a new
persistent volume. If the target cluster contains an unbound
persistent volume that satisfies the PersistentVolumeClaim
requirements, the cluster is bound to the volume.
Click Reuse existing volumes containing your data to
not restore volume backup data. Any PersistentVolumeClaims are
bound to volumes that reference existing persistent disks.
(Optional) In the Choose cluster-scoped resources section, complete
the following and click Next :
Choose what group kinds to restore:
Click All cluster-scoped resources to restore all
cluster-scoped resources in the backup.
Click Add groupkinds under the Exceptions section to exclude
any cluster-scoped resource in the backup.
Click Selected cluster-scoped resources to specify the
cluster-scoped resources in the backup to restore.
apiextensions.k8s.io/CustomResourceDefinition and
storage.k8s.io/StorageClass are selected by default. Click
Add groupkind to add more cluster-scoped resources.
Click No cluster-scoped resources to choose to not restore
any cluster resource.
Caution: Backup for GKE is not allowed to select cluster-scoped
resources that are managed by GKE clusters or driven by restore
configuration elsewhere. Such GroupKinds include Namespace , Node ,
PersistentVolume , gkebackup.gke.io/BackupJob ,
gkebackup.gke.io/RestoreJob , metrics.k8s.io/NodeMetrics ,
migration.k8s.io/StorageState ,
migration.k8s.io/StorageVersionMigration ,
snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshotContent ,
storage.k8s.io/CSINode . Selecting
All cluster-scoped resources automatically skips these
cluster-scoped resources. Listing them explicitly results in an
error.
Choose how to handle conflicts if any cluster-scoped resources are
selected:
Click Keep resources in target cluster to skip a resource if
it already exists in the target cluster.
Click Replace resources in target cluster to delete a
resource if it already exists in the target cluster, and restore
the copy from the backup.
Warning: this is a dangerous option which could cause
unintentional data loss if used inappropriately. For example,
deleting a CRD will cause Kubernetes to delete all CRs of that
type.
(Optional) In the Add transformation rules section, complete the
following and click Next :
Click Add rule and enter an optional description.
If you want to restrict the transformation rules to resources that match specific conditions, do the following in the Specify resource conditions and actions section:
Click Namespaces condition and type a list of namespaces to match resources within those namespaces.
Click Groupkind condition and type API group kind and then type the object kind. This matches
an API group to resources within those types.
Click JSON path condition and type the JSON path that identifies the fields within the matched resources
for which the transformation applies.
Type the new value that replaces the current value of the matched attributes,
or select the Replace specific values (using a regular expression) checkbox.
Then type the pattern to compare against the current value of those resources.
