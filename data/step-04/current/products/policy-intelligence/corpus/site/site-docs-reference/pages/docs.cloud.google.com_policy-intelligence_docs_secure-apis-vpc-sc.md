Help secure Policy Intelligence APIs with VPC Service Controls
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
With VPC Service Controls, you can create perimeters , which are boundaries
around your Google Cloud resources. You can then define security policies
that help prevent access to supported services from outside of the perimeter.
For more information about VPC Service Controls, see the VPC Service Controls
overview .
You can use VPC Service Controls to help secure the following
Policy Intelligence APIs:
Policy Troubleshooter API
Policy Simulator API

Preview
— Securing the Policy Troubleshooter API with VPC Service Controls
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
You can help secure policy troubleshooting by using VPC Service Controls.
When you restrict the Policy Troubleshooter API with a perimeter,
principals can troubleshoot IAM policies only if all resources
involved in the request are in the same perimeter. There are usually two
resources involved in a troubleshooting request:
The resource you're troubleshooting access for. This resource can be any
type. You explicitly specify this resource when you troubleshoot an
IAM policy.
The resource you're using to troubleshoot access. This resource must be
a project, folder, or organization. In the Google Cloud console and
gcloud CLI, this resource is inferred based on the project, folder,
or organization that you have selected. In the REST API, you specify this
resource using the x-goog-user-project header.
This resource can be the same as the resource that you're troubleshooting
access for, but it doesn't need to be.
If these resources aren't in the same perimeter, the request fails.
For more details about how VPC Service Controls works with
Policy Troubleshooter, see the
Policy Troubleshooter entry in
the VPC Service Controls supported products table .
Help secure the Policy Simulator API
You can restrict the Policy Simulator API with a perimeter when simulating
organization policies or allow and deny policies.
Principals can simulate organization policies as expected inside service
perimeters.
VPC Service Controls doesn't support adding folder or organization resources to service
perimeters. Therefore, you cannot use VPC Service Controls to protect folder-level and
organization-level deny policy simulations. Deny policy simulations on resources outside of
the service perimeter still return complete results, and deny policy simulations on
project-level resources are protected.
Principals can simulate allow policies only if certain resources involved in the
simulation are in the same perimeter. There are several resources
involved in an allow policy simulation:
The resource whose allow policy you're simulating. This resource is
also called the target resource . In the Google Cloud console, this is the
resource whose allow policy you're editing. In the gcloud CLI and
REST API, you explicitly specify this resource when you simulate an allow
policy.
The project, folder, or organization that creates and runs the simulation.
This resource is also called the host resource . In the
Google Cloud console and gcloud CLI, this resource is inferred
based on the project, folder, or organization you have selected. In the REST
API, you specify this resource using the x-goog-user-project header.
This resource can be the same as the target resource, but it doesn't need to
be.
The resource that provides access logs for the simulation. In a
simulation, there is always one resource that provides access logs for the
simulation. This resource varies depending on the target resource type:
If you are simulating an allow policy for a project or organization, Policy
Simulator retrieves the access logs for that project or organization.
If you are simulating an allow policy for a different type of resource,
Policy Simulator retrieves the access logs for that resource's parent
project or organization.
If you are simulating multiple resources' allow policies at once, Policy
Simulator retrieves the access logs for the resources' nearest common
project or organization.
All supported resources with relevant allow policies. When Policy
Simulator runs a simulation, it considers all allow policies that might
impact the user's access, including allow policies on the target resource's
ancestor and descendant resources. As a result, these ancestor and descendant
resources are also involved in simulations.
If the target resource and the host resource aren't in the same perimeter, the
request fails.
If the target resource and the resource that provides access logs for the
simulation aren't in the same perimeter, the request fails.
If the target resource and some supported resources with relevant allow policies
aren't in the same perimeter, the requests succeeds, but the results might be
incomplete. For example, if you're simulating a policy for a project in a
perimeter, the results won't include the allow policy of the project's parent
organization, because organizations are always outside of VPC Service Controls
perimeters. To get more complete results, you can configure ingress and egress
rules for the perimeter.
