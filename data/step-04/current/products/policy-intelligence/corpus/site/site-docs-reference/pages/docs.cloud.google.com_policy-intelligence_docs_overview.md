Policy Intelligence overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Large organizations often have an extensive set of Google Cloud policies to
control resources and manage access. Policy Intelligence tools
help you understand and manage your policies to proactively improve your
security configuration.
The following sections explain what you can do with
Policy Intelligence tools.
Understand policies and usage
There are several Policy Intelligence tools that help you
understand what access your policies allow and how the policies are being used.
Analyze access
Cloud Asset Inventory provides Policy Analyzer for IAM allow
policies, which lets you find out what principals have access to which
Google Cloud resources based on your
IAM allow policies .
Policy Analyzer helps you answer questions like the following:
"Who has any access to this IAM service account?"
"What roles and permissions does this user have on this
BigQuery dataset?"
"Which BigQuery datasets does this user have permission
to read?"
By helping you answer these questions, Policy Analyzer lets you
effectively administer access. You can also use Policy Analyzer for
audit-related and compliance-related tasks.
To learn more about Policy Analyzer for allow policies, see
Policy Analyzer overview .
To learn how to use Policy Analyzer for allow policies, see
Analyzing IAM policies .
Analyze organization policies
Preview
— Securing the Policy Troubleshooter API with VPC Service Controls
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Policy Intelligence provides Policy Analyzer for
Organization Policy, which you can use to create an analysis query to get
information on both custom and predefined organization policies.
You can use Policy Analyzer to return a list of organization policies
with a particular constraint and the resources to which those policies are
attached.
To learn how to use Policy Analyzer for Organization Policy, see
Analyze existing organization policies .
Troubleshoot access issues
To help you understand and remedy access issues,
Policy Intelligence offers the following troubleshooters:
Policy Troubleshooter for Identity and Access Management
VPC Service Controls troubleshooter
Policy Troubleshooter for Chrome Enterprise Premium
Access troubleshooters help answer "why" questions like the following:
"Why does this user have the bigquery.datasets.create permission on this
BigQuery dataset?"
"Why isn't this user able to view the allow policy of this
Cloud Storage bucket?"
To learn more about these troubleshooters, see Access-related
troubleshooters .
Understand service account usage and permissions
Service accounts are a special type of principal that you
can use to authenticate applications in Google Cloud.
To help you understand service account usage, Policy Intelligence
offers the following features:
Activity Analyzer : Activity Analyzer lets you see when your service
accounts and keys were last used to call a Google API. To learn how to use
Activity Analyzer, see View recent usage for service accounts and
keys .
Service account insights : Service account insights are a type of
insight that identify which service accounts in your project have
not been used in the past 90 days. To learn how to manage
service account insights, see Find unused service accounts .
To help you understand service account permissions,
Policy Intelligence offers lateral movement insights. Lateral
movement insights are a type of insight that identify roles that
allow a service account in one project to impersonate a service account in
another project. For more information about lateral movement insights, see How
lateral movement insights are generated . To learn
how to manage lateral movement insights, see Identify service accounts with
lateral movement permissions .
Lateral movement insights are sometimes linked to role
recommendations . Role recommendations suggest actions that you can
take to remediate the issues identified by lateral movement insights.
Improve your policies
You can improve your IAM allow policies by
using role recommendations. Role recommendations help you enforce the principle
of least privilege by ensuring that principals have only the permissions that
they actually need. Each role recommendation suggests that you remove or replace
an IAM role that gives your principals excess
permissions.
To learn more about role recommendations, including how they're generated, see
Enforce least privilege with role recommendations .
To learn how to manage role recommendations, see one of the following guides:
Review and apply role recommendations for projects, folders, and
organizations
Review and apply role recommendations for Cloud Storage
buckets
Review and apply role recommendations for BigQuery
datasets
Prevent policy misconfigurations
There are several Policy Intelligence tools that you can use to
see how changes to policies will impact your organization. After you see the
effect of the changes, you can decide whether or not to make them.
Note: If you want to get warnings when you're about to make a change that
Google Cloud views as risky, you can enable change risk
recommendations . Change risk recommendations
generate warnings when you try to make certain high-risk changes, like revoking
a project-level role that Google Cloud has identified as important.
Test changes to access-related policies
To let you see how a change to an access-related policy might affect your
principals' access, Policy Intelligence provides the following
policy simulators:
Policy Simulator for allow policies
Policy Simulator for deny policies
Policy Simulator for principal access boundary policies
Each of these simulators lets you see how a change to a policy of that type
would affect access for your principals before you commit to making the change.
Each simulator only evaluates one policy type—they don't take into account
whether other types of policies would permit or block access.
Test organization policy changes
Policy Simulator for Organization Policy lets you preview the impact of
a new custom constraint or organization policy that enforces a custom constraint
before it is enforced on your production environment.
Policy Simulator provides a list of resources that violate the proposed policy
before it is enforced, allowing you to reconfigure those resources, request
exceptions, or change the scope of your organization policy, all without
disrupting your developers or bringing down your environment.
To learn how to use Policy Simulator to test changes to organization policies,
see Test organization policy changes with Policy
Simulator .
