This feature is

Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.

launch stage descriptions .
This page shows you how to use Activity Analyzer to see when your service
accounts and keys were last used to call a Google API. These usages are called
authentication activities .
Recent authentication activity can help you identify the service accounts and
service account keys that you no longer use. We recommend disabling or deleting
these unused service accounts and keys because they create an unnecessary
security risk.
When viewing usage for service accounts, keep in mind that requests
authenticated by
API keys bound to service accounts
aren't recorded in
service account usage metrics .
Authentication activities with a Google API outside of Google Cloud, such as
domain-wide delegation of
authority to Google Workspace APIs, aren't tracked by
Activity Analyzer
or service account insights . To
track these authentication activities, use Cloud Monitoring
service account usage metrics .
Cross reference Activity Analyzer results with Cloud Monitoring service
account usage metrics before you disable or delete a service account. This
approach prevents you from removing service accounts that are in use with Google
APIs outside of Google Cloud.
Note: You can also use service account insights to identify unused
service accounts. Service account insights identify service accounts that
haven't been used in the past 90 days.
Before you begin
Understand authentication activities .
Enable the Policy Analyzer API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Note: The Policy Analyzer API is separate from Cloud Asset Inventory's Policy
Analyzer . The Policy Analyzer API lets you view recent
authentication and authorization activities. Cloud Asset Inventory's Policy
Analyzer lets you analyze your allow policies to determine who has what access
to your Google Cloud resources.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to list the most recent authentication activities for your
service accounts and service account keys,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Activity Analysis Viewer ( roles/policyanalyzer.activityAnalysisViewer )
IAM role on the project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to list the most recent authentication activities for your
service accounts and service account keys. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to list the most recent authentication activities for your
service accounts and service account keys:
policyanalyzer.serviceAccountKeyLastAuthenticationActivities.query
policyanalyzer.serviceAccountLastAuthenticationActivities.query
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
View recent usage for all service accounts or keys
To list the dates of the most recent authentication activities for all of your
service accounts or service account keys, use the Google Cloud CLI or REST API.
gcloud
To list the most recent authentication activities for your service accounts or
keys, use the gcloud policy-intelligence query-activity command:
gcloud policy-intelligence query-activity --activity-type = ACTIVITY_TYPE \
--project = PROJECT_ID --limit = LIMIT
Replace the following values:
ACTIVITY_TYPE : The activity type that you want to
list. To list the most recent usage times for your service accounts, use
serviceAccountLastAuthentication . To list most recent usage times for your
service account keys, use serviceAccountKeyLastAuthentication .
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like my-project .
LIMIT : Optional. The maximum number of results to
be returned. The default value is 1000 .
The response is similar to the following, which lists recent usage times for
a project's service accounts:
---

startTime : '2020-09-01T07:00:00Z'
Note: If you list authentication activities for service accounts, the results
include disabled service accounts. If you list authentication activities for
service account keys, the results do not include disabled service account
keys, but they might include expired or deleted service account keys.
To learn how to understand these results, see Understand
activities on this page.
REST
To list the most recent authentication activities for your service accounts or keys, use the Policy Analyzer API's
activities.query

Use the metadata in the response to identify the key you want to track.
Then, copy the key's unique ID from the end of the name field.
The name field has the following format:
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /serviceAccounts/ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL /keys/ KEY_ID "
The key's unique ID is everything after keys/ .
For example, the unique ID in the following key name is
0f561cc41650ff521899de2fd653bd3de08e2da4 :
"name" : "projects/my-project/serviceAccounts/my-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com/keys/0f561cc41650ff521899de2fd653bd3de08e2da4"
After you find the unique IDs for the service account keys, use the IDs to
filter the results from Activity Analyzer:
To get the most recent authentication activity for specific service account keys, use the Policy Analyzer API's
activities.query
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project
ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like my-project .
FILTER : A filter specifying the full resource names of the service
account keys whose usage you want to see. The full resource name of a service account key
includes the project ID, the email address of the service account associated with the key, and
the key ID.
To filter for a single service account key, use a filter with the following format:
activities.full_resource_name%3D%22%2F%2Fiam.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2F PROJECT_ID %2FserviceAccounts%2F SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL %2Fkeys%2F KEY_ID %22
To filter for multiple service account keys, use %20OR%20 to specify multiple
acceptable full resource names:
activities.full_resource_name%3D%22%2F%2Fiam.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2F PROJECT_ID %2FserviceAccounts%2F SERVICE_ACCOUNT_1_EMAIL %2Fkeys%2F KEY_ID_1 %22%20OR%20activities.full_resource_name%3D%22%2F%2Fiam.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2F PROJECT_ID %2FserviceAccounts%2F SERVICE_ACCOUNT_2_EMAIL %2Fkeys%2F KEY_ID_2 %22
You can filter for up to 10 service account keys.
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://policyanalyzer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/activityTypes/serviceAccountKeyLastAuthentication/activities:query?filter= FILTER
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ "https://policyanalyzer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/activityTypes/serviceAccountKeyLastAuthentication/activities:query?filter= FILTER "
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or

Console
The query results page lists the query parameters and the results of the
query.
For a service account query, the results table lists each service account from
the query and when it last authenticated:
For a service account key query, the results table lists each service account
key from the query, the service account it's associated with, and when it last
authenticated.
The results might not include very recent authentication events. Check the
tooltip to see the exact date range used during the analysis. The results don't
include authentication events that occurred outside of this range.
The results table for both queries also lists the IAM roles that
the service account has on the project, along with any security insights. These
insights highlight patterns in how your service accounts access resources. For
example, some insights highlight excess permissions , or permissions that a
principal doesn't need. Other insights highlight service accounts with lateral
movement permissions , or permissions that let the
service account impersonate a service account in another project.
Some insights also come with role
recommendations that suggest changes you can
make to reduce excess permissions. To learn how to manage recommendations and
insights, see Review and apply recommendations .
