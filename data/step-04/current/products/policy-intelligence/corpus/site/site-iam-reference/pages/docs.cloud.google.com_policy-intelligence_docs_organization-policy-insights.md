Review organization policy insights for projects, folders, and organizations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows how to manage organization policy insights, which are findings about resource configuration
and usage. Organization policy insights can help you identify resources that are not protected by
organization policies.
Organization policy insights are sometimes linked to
organization policy recommendations . Organization policy recommendations suggest actions that you
can take to remediate the issues identified by organization policy insights.
Before you begin
Enable the Recommender API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Be familiar with organization policy recommendations .
Optional: Read about Recommender insights .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to view and modify organization policy insights,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Org Policy Recommender Admin ( roles/recommender.orgPolicyAdmin )
IAM role on the resource that you want to manage insights for
(project, folder, or organization).
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to view and modify organization policy insights. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to view and modify organization policy insights:
recommender.orgPolicyInsights.get
recommender.orgPolicyInsights.list
recommender.orgPolicyInsights.update
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
List organization policy insights
To list all organization policy insights for your
project,
folder,
or organization,
use one of the following methods:
gcloud
Use the gcloud recommender
insights list command to view all organization policy insights for your
project,
folder,
or organization.
Before you run the command, replace the following values:
RESOURCE_TYPE : The resource type that you want to list insights
for. Use the value
project ,
folder ,
or organization .
RESOURCE_ID : The ID of the
project,
folder,
or organization that you want to list insights for.
gcloud recommender insights list --insight-type = google.orgpolicy.policy.Insight \
-- RESOURCE_TYPE = RESOURCE_ID \
--location = global
The output lists all of the organization policy insights for your
project,
folder,
or organization. For example:
INSIGHT_ID CATEGORY INSIGHT_STATE LAST_REFRESH_TIME SEVERITY INSIGHT_SUBTYPE DESCRIPTION

REST
The Recommender API's
insights.list
method lists all organization policy insights for your
project,
folder,
or organization.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
RESOURCE_TYPE : The resource type that you want to list insights for.
Use the value
projects ,
folders ,
or organizations .
RESOURCE_ID : The ID of the
project,
folder,
or organization that you want to list insights for.
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project
ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like my-project .
HTTP method and URL:

organization policy insights on this page.
Review organization policy insights
After you get a single insight, you can review its contents to
understand the configuration of the organization policy on your resources, including any violations.
Organization policy insights ( google.orgpolicy.policy.Insight ) insights have the following
components, not necessarily in this order:
associatedRecommendations : The identifiers for any recommendations associated
with the insight. If there are no recommendations associated with the insight, this field is
empty.
category : The category for organization policy insights is always
SECURITY .
content : Provides details about the resources and the organization policy that were analyzed. This field contains the
following components:
constraint : The constraint that was analyzed.
consolidatedPolicy : The organization policy for the analyzed resource.
evaluatedResources : The resources that were evaluated to generate the insight.
violations : The number and types of resources that violate the organization
policy.
description : A human-readable summary of the insight.
etag : A unique identifier for the current state of an insight.
Each time the insight changes, a new etag value is assigned.
To change the state of an insight, you must provide the etag of the
existing insight. Using the etag helps ensure that any operations are
performed only if the insight has not changed since you last retrieved it.
insightSubtype : The insight subtype.
lastRefreshTime : The date when the insight was last refreshed, which indicates
the freshness of the data used to generate the insight.
name : The name of the insight, in the following format:
RESOURCE_TYPE / RESOURCE_ID /locations/global/insightTypes/google.orgpolicy.policy.Insight/insights/ INSIGHT_ID
The placeholders have the following values:
RESOURCE_TYPE : The resource type that the insight was generated
for.
RESOURCE_ID : The ID of the project, folder, or organization where
the insight was generated.
INSIGHT_ID : A unique ID for the insight.
observationPeriod : The time period leading up to the insight. The
source data used to generate the insight ends at lastRefreshTime and
begins at lastRefreshTime minus observationPeriod .
severity : The severity of the insight. Insights for organization policies have a
severity of HIGH .
stateInfo : Insights go through multiple state transitions after
they are proposed:
ACTIVE : The insight has been generated, but either no actions have been
taken, or an action was taken without updating the insight's state. Active
insights are updated when the underlying data changes.
ACCEPTED : Some action has been taken based on the insight. Insights
become accepted when an associated recommendation was marked CLAIMED ,
SUCCEEDED , or FAILED , or the insight was accepted directly. When
an insight is in the ACCEPTED state, the content of the insight cannot
change. Accepted insights are retained for 90 days after
they are accepted.
targetResources : The full resource name
of the project, folder, or organization that the insight is for. For example,
//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/1234567890 .
Mark a organization policy insight as ACCEPTED
If you take action based on an active insight, you can mark that insight as
ACCEPTED . The ACCEPTED state tells the
Recommender API that you have taken action based on this
insight, which helps refine your recommendations.
Accepted insights are retained for 90 days after
they are marked as ACCEPTED .
gcloud
Use the
gcloud recommender insights mark-accepted command with your insight ID to mark
an insight as ACCEPTED .
INSIGHT_ID : The ID of the insight that you want to
view. To find the ID, list the insights for your
project,
folder,
or organization.
RESOURCE_TYPE : The resource type that you want to manage insights
for. Use the value
project ,
folder ,
or organization .
RESOURCE_ID : The ID of the
project,
folder,
or organization that you want to manage insights for.
ETAG : An identifier for a version of the insight. To
get the etag , do the following:
Get the insight using the gcloud recommender
insights describe command.
Find and copy the etag value from the output, including the enclosing
quotes. For example, "d3cdec23cc712bd0" .
gcloud recommender insights mark-accepted INSIGHT_ID \
--insight-type = google.orgpolicy.policy.Insight \

--location = global \
