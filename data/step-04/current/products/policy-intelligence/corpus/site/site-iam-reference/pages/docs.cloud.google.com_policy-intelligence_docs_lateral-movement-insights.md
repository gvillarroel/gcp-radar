Find service accounts with lateral movement permissions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows how to manage lateral movement insights, which identify
roles that allow a service account in one project to impersonate a service account in another
project. For more information about lateral movement insights, see
How lateral movement insights are generated .
Lateral movement insights are sometimes linked to
role recommendations . Role recommendations suggest actions that you
can take to remediate the issues identified by lateral movement insights.
Before you begin
Enable the Recommender API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Be familiar with IAM role recommendations .
Ensure that you have an
organization-level or project-level activation of the
Premium or Enterprise tier of Security Command Center.
For more information, see
Billing questions .
Optional: Read about Recommender insights .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to manage lateral movement insights,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on the
project,
folder,
or organization that you want to
manage insights for:
To view lateral movement insights:
IAM Recommender Viewer ( roles/recommender.iamViewer )
To modify lateral movement insights:
IAM Recommender Admin ( roles/recommender.iamAdmin )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to manage lateral movement insights. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to manage lateral movement insights:
To view lateral movement insights:
recommender.iamPolicyLateralMovementInsights.get
recommender.iamPolicyLateralMovementInsights.list
To modify lateral movement insights:
recommender.iamPolicyLateralMovementInsights.update
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
List lateral movement insights
To list all lateral movement insights for your
project,
folder,
or organization,
use one of the following methods:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go
to IAM
Select a project, folder, or organization.
The Security insights column shows all security-related insights for your
project, including lateral movement insights. Lateral movement insights have the form
N service account impersonations , where
N is the number of service accounts that the service account in
the role binding can impersonate.
gcloud
Use the gcloud recommender
insights list command to view all lateral movement insights for your
project,
folder,
or organization.
Before you run the command, replace the following values:
RESOURCE_TYPE : The resource type that you want to list insights
for. Use the value
project ,
folder ,
or organization .
RESOURCE_ID : The ID of the
project,
folder,
or organization that you want to list insights for.
gcloud recommender insights list --insight-type = google.iam.policy.LateralMovementInsight \
-- RESOURCE_TYPE = RESOURCE_ID \
--location = global
The output lists all of the lateral movement insights for your
project,
folder,
or organization. For example:

Review lateral movement insights
After you get a single insight, you can review its contents to understand the pattern of resource
usage that it highlights.
Console
When you click a lateral movement insight in the Google Cloud console, the
Google Cloud console opens a pane showing the details of the insight. The appearance of these
details depends on whether the insight is associated with a recommendation.
Note: You can check if an insight is associated with a recommendation by looking
for the Recommendation available
icon in the Security insights column.
If the insight is associated with a recommendation, the pane shows the
details of the recommendation .
If the insight is not associated with a recommendation, the pane shows the following:
The service account's origin project : The project that the service
account with impersonation permissions was created in.
Service accounts that can be impersonated in this project. A list
of all of the service accounts in the current project that the service account
with impersonation permissions can impersonate.
Permissions that allow impersonation in the project : A list of the
impersonation permissions that the service account has.
Current permissions : A list of all of the service account's permissions.

Mark a lateral movement insight as ACCEPTED
If you take action based on an active insight, you can mark that insight as
ACCEPTED . The ACCEPTED state tells the
Recommender API that you have taken action based on this
insight, which helps refine your recommendations.
Accepted insights are retained for 90 days after
they are marked as ACCEPTED .
Console
If an insight is associated with a recommendation,
applying the recommendation
changes the insight's state to ACCEPTED .
To mark an insight as ACCEPTED without applying a recommendation, use the
gcloud CLI or REST API.
gcloud
Use the
gcloud recommender insights mark-accepted command with your insight ID to mark
an insight as ACCEPTED .
INSIGHT_ID : The ID of the insight that you want to
view. To find the ID, list the insights for your
project,
folder,
or organization.
RESOURCE_TYPE : The resource type that you want to manage insights
for. Use the value
project ,
