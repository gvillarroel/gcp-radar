Configure role recommendation generation
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
By changing your IAM recommender configuration, you can customize how
your role recommendations are generated. This page explains how to edit your
configuration to change how quickly recommendations are generated for your
project.
Though the IAM recommender generates role recommendations for a variety
of resources, you can only edit how role recommendations are generated for
projects.
Before you begin
Enable the Recommender API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Understand how the IAM recommender generates role recommendations .
Install the Google Cloud CLI .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to configure IAM role recommendations,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on the project whose IAM recommender you want to configure:
View configuration details:
IAM Recommender Viewer (roles/recommender.iamViewer)
Modify your configuration:
IAM Recommender Admin (roles/recommender.iamAdmin)
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to configure IAM role recommendations. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to configure IAM role recommendations:
View configuration details:
recommender.iamPolicyRecommenderConfig.get
Modify your configuration:
recommender.iamPolicyRecommenderConfig.update
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
View your current configuration
View your current configuration to see how many days of permission usage data
the IAM recommender waits before generating role recommendations.
You can view the configuration using the gcloud CLI or the REST API.
gcloud
To get a project's IAM recommender configuration, use the
gcloud beta recommender recommender-config describe
command.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project
ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like my-project .
Execute the
gcloud beta recommender recommender-config describe
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud beta recommender recommender-config describe \
google.iam.policy.Recommender \
--project = " PROJECT_ID " \
--location = "global"
Windows (PowerShell)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud beta recommender recommender-config describe `
google.iam.policy.Recommender `
--project = " PROJECT_ID " `
--location = "global"
Windows (cmd.exe)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud beta recommender recommender-config describe ^
google.iam.policy.Recommender ^
--project = " PROJECT_ID " ^
--location = "global"
The response contains the project's IAM recommender configuration. For example, it
might look like the following:
etag: '"d3e779ee3f34f276"'
name: projects/123456789012/locations/global/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/config
recommenderGenerationConfig:
params:
minimum_observation_period: P90D
revisionId: DEFAULT
updateTime: '2022-10-02T22:57:33Z'
REST
To get a project's IAM recommender configuration, use the Recommender API's
projects.locations.recommenders.getConfig
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER : The
numeric ID of your Google Cloud project.
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project
ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like my-project .
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/config
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \ "https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/config"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/config" | Select-Object -Expand Content
The response contains the project's IAM recommender configuration. For example, it
might look like the following:
{
"name": "projects/123456789012/locations/global/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/config",
"recommenderGenerationConfig": {
"params": {
"minimum_observation_period": "P90D"
}
},
"etag": "\"d3e779ee3f34f276\"",
"updateTime": "2022-10-02T22:57:33Z",
"revisionId": "DEFAULT"
}
Understand configuration details
The contents of a configuration depend on which recommender the configuration is
for. IAM recommender configurations have the following components, not
necessarily in this order:
name : The identifier for the configuration, in the
form
projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/config .
recommenderGenerationConfig : The parameters that the
IAM recommender uses when generating recommendations. This field
contains the following parameters:
minimum_observation_period : The number of days of
permission usage data that the IAM recommender needs to start
generating role recommendations. If you get a project's IAM
recommender configuration, and this field hasn't been set, its value is
0 .
etag : An identifier for the current state of a configuration,
used to prevent concurrent updates. Each time the configuration changes, a new
ETag value is assigned.
updateTime : The timestamp of the most recent time that the
configuration was updated, in UTC format
( RFC 3339 ).
revisionId : Output only. An identifier for the current revision
of the configuration. This value is updated every time the configuration is
edited.
Edit your configuration
Edit your configuration to change how quickly recommendations are generated for
your project.
Important: If you set the minimum observation period to fewer than
90 days, you'll get recommendations sooner, but the accuracy
of the recommendations might be affected.
gcloud
To edit a project's IAM recommender configuration, use the
gcloud beta recommender recommender-config update
command.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
OBSERVATION_PERIOD : The minimum observation period that you want to set.
Use one of the following values: P30D (30 days), P60D (60 days), or
P90D (90 days).
ETAG : The configuration's current etag, which you can find by
getting the current configuration and copying the value of the
response's etag field.
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project
ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like my-project .
Save the following content in a file called request.json :
{
"params" : {
"minimum_observation_period" : " OBSERVATION_PERIOD "
}
}
Execute the
gcloud beta recommender recommender-config update
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
