Policy Analyzer for allow policies
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Policy Analyzer for allow policies lets you find out which principals
(for example, users, service accounts, groups, and domains) have what access to
which Google Cloud resources based on your IAM allow
policies .
Policy Analyzer for allow policies can help you answer questions like
these:
Who can access this IAM service account?
Who can read data in this BigQuery dataset that contains personally
identifiable information (PII)?
What roles and permissions does the dev-testers group have on any
resource in this project?
What Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances can Tal delete in project
A?
Who can access this Cloud Storage bucket at 7 PM?
How Policy Analyzer for allow policies works
To use Policy Analyzer for allow policies, you create an analysis
query, specify a scope for the analysis, and then run the query.
Analysis queries
To use Policy Analyzer, you create an analysis query specifying one
or more of the following fields:
Principals: The identities (for example, users, service accounts, groups,
and domains) whose access you want to check
Access: The permissions and roles that you want to check for
Resources: The resources that you want to check for access to
(API only) Condition context: The context—for example, time of
day—under which you want to check for access
Typically, you specify one or two of these fields in the analysis query, then
use the query results to get more information about the fields that you didn't
specify. For example, if you wanted to know who has a certain permission on a
certain resource, you would specify the access and resource in the analysis
query, but you would not specify the principal.
For more examples of the kinds of queries you can create, see Common query
types .
Analysis scope
To run an analysis query, you need to specify a scope to
analyze. The scope is an organization, a folder, or a project that you want to
restrict your analysis to. Only IAM allow policies attached to
the resource used as the scope and to its descendants will be analyzed.
In the REST API and gcloud CLI, you specify the scope manually. In
the Google Cloud console, the scope is automatically determined based on the
project, folder, or organization that you're managing.
After you create an analysis query and specify the scope, you can run the
query to analyze policies in that scope.
Query results
When you run an analysis query, Policy Analyzer reports any role
bindings that contain the principals, access, and resources that
you specified in the query. For each role binding, it reports the principals in
the binding, the access (role and permissions) that the binding grants, and
the resource that the binding grants access to.
You can review these results to better understand access in your project,
folder, or organization. For example, if you ran a query to find out which
principals have access to a specific resource, you would review the principals
in the query results.
You can adjust the information in your query results by enabling query
options .
Supported policy types
Policy Analyzer for allow policies only supports IAM
allow
policies .
Policy Analyzer for allow policies doesn't support the following forms of access
control:
IAM deny policies
IAM principal access boundary policies
Google Kubernetes Engine role-based access control
Cloud Storage access control lists
Cloud Storage public access prevention
Policy Analyzer query results don't account for unsupported policy
types. For example, imagine that a user has the iam.roles.get permission on a
project because of an allow policy, but a deny policy prevents them from using
the permission. Policy Analyzer will report that they have the
iam.roles.get permission, despite the deny policy.
Policy inheritance
To account for policy inheritance ,
Policy Analyzer automatically analyzes all relevant allow policies
within the specified scope, regardless of where they are in the resource
hierarchy .
For example, imagine you're trying to find out who can access an
IAM service account:
If you scope the query to a project, Policy Analyzer analyzes
the allow policy of the service account and the allow policy of the project.
If you scope the query to an organization, Policy Analyzer analyzes
the allow policy of the service account, the allow policy of the project that
owns the service account, the allow policies of any folders containing the
project, and the allow policy of the organization.
Conditional access
If a role binding has a condition , it only grants a principal
access when that condition is met. Policy Analyzer always reports
conditions that are attached to relevant role bindings. Relevant role bindings
are role bindings that contain the principals, access, and resources that you
specified in the analysis query.
In some cases, Policy Analyzer can also analyze the condition, meaning
that it can report whether the condition would be met. Policy Analyzer
can analyze the following types of conditions:
Conditions based on resource attributes ,
for resource types that provide a resource name .
Date/time conditions (API and gcloud CLI
only). For Policy Analyzer to analyze these conditions, you need to
provide the time of the access ( accessTime ) in your analysis query. To learn
how to provide this context, see Determine access at a specific
time .
If a relevant role binding contains a condition, Policy Analyzer does
one of the following:
If Policy Analyzer can analyze the condition, it does one of the
following:
If the condition evaluates to true, Policy Analyzer includes the
role binding in the query results and marks the condition evaluation as
TRUE .
If the condition evaluates to false, Policy Analyzer does not
include the role in the query results.
If Policy Analyzer can't analyze a condition for a relevant role
binding, it includes the role in the query results and marks the condition
evaluation as CONDITIONAL .
Data freshness
Policy Analyzer uses the Cloud Asset API, which offers best-effort data freshness.
While almost all policy updates appear in Policy Analyzer in minutes, it's
possible that Policy Analyzer won't include the most recent policy updates.
Common query types
This section describes how to use analysis queries to answer common
access-related questions.
Which principals can access this resource?
To determine which principals can access a resource, create an analysis query
that specifies the resource and, optionally, the roles and permissions that you
want to check for.
These queries can help you answer questions like the following:
Who has access to this IAM service account?
Who has permission to impersonate this IAM service
account?
Who are the billing administrators on project A?
(API and gcloud CLI only): Who can update project A by
impersonating a service account?
To learn how to create and send these queries, see Determine which principals
can access a resource .
Which principals have these roles and permissions?
To determine which principals have certain roles and permissions, create
an analysis query that specifies a principal and a set of roles and permissions
that you want to check for.
These queries can help you answer questions like the following:
Who has permission to impersonate service accounts in my organization?
Who are the billing administrators in my organization?
Who can read data in this BigQuery dataset that contains
personally identifiable information (PII)?
(API and gcloud CLI only): Who in my organization can read a
BigQuery dataset by impersonating a service account?
To learn how to create and send these queries, see Determine which principals
have certain roles or permissions .
What roles and permissions does this principal have on this resource?
To determine what roles and permissions a principal has on a specific resource,
create an analysis query that specifies a principal and a resource that
you want to check for permissions on.
These queries can help you answer questions like the following:
What roles and permissions does user Sasha have on this
BigQuery dataset?
What roles and permissions does the dev-testers group have on any
resource in this project?
(API and gcloud CLI only): What roles and permissions does the
user Dana have on this BigQuery dataset if Dana
impersonates a service account?
To learn how to create and send these queries, see Determine what access a
principal has on a resource .
Which resources can this principal access?
To determine what resources a specific principal can access, create an analysis
query that specifies a principal and the roles and permissions that you want to
check for.
These queries can help you answer questions like the following:
Which BigQuery datasets does the user Mahan have
permission to read?
Which BigQuery datasets is the dev-testers group the
data owner of?
What VMs can Tal delete in project A?
(API and gcloud CLI only): What VMs can the user John delete
by impersonating a service account?
To learn how to create and send these queries, see Determine which resources a
principal can access .
Saved analysis queries
If you're using the REST API, you can save analysis queries to reuse or share
with others. You can run a saved query just like you would run any other query.
To learn more about saving queries, see Manage saved queries .
Export query results
You can run queries asynchronously and export query results to
BigQuery or Cloud Storage by using
analyzeIamPolicyLongrunning .
To learn how to export query results to BigQuery, see Write
policy analysis to BigQuery .
To learn how to export query results to Cloud Storage, see Write
policy analysis to Cloud Storage .
Query options
Policy Analyzer offers several options that add more details to your
query
results.
To learn how to enable these options, see Enable options .
Group expansion
If you enable group expansion, any groups in the query results are
expanded into individual members. This expansion is capped at
1,000 members per group. If you have
sufficient group permissions, nested groups will also be expanded. This option
is only effective if you don't specify a principal in your query.
For example, imagine you enable group expansion for the query "Who has the
storage.buckets.delete permission for project-1 ?" If
Policy Analyzer finds any groups that have the storage.buckets.delete
permission, the query results will list not only the group identifier, but also
all individual members in the group.
This option lets you understand individual users' access, even if that access is
a result of their membership in a group.
Role expansion
If you enable role expansion, the query results list all permissions inside each
role in addition to the role itself. This option is only available if you don't
specify any permissions or roles in your query.
For example, imagine you enable role expansion for the query "What access does
my-user@example.com have on the bucket bucket-1 ?" If
Policy Analyzer finds any roles that give my-user@example.com access
to bucket-1 , the query results will list not only the role name, but also all
permissions included in the role.
This option lets you see exactly what permissions your principals have.
Resource expansion
If you enable resource expansion for a Policy Analyzer query, the query
results list all relevant descendant resources for any
parent resources (projects, folders, and organizations) in the query results.
This expansion is capped at 1,000
resources per parent resource for Policy Analyzer queries and
100,000 resources
per parent resource for longrunning Policy Analyzer queries.
For example, consider how resource expansion would affect the following queries:
Who has the storage.buckets.delete permission for project-1 ?
If you enable resource expansion for this query, the resources section of the
query results will list not only the project, but also all storage buckets
inside the project.
Which resources does my-user@example.com have the
compute.instances.setIamPolicy permission on?
If you enable resource expansion for this query and Policy Analyzer
finds that my-user@example.com has a project-level role that contains that
permission, the resources section of the query results will list not only the
project, but also all Compute Engine instances inside the project.
This option lets you get a detailed understanding of the resources that your
principals can access.
Service account impersonation
If you are using the REST API or gcloud CLI you can enable analysis
of service account impersonation .
If this option is enabled, Policy Analyzer runs additional analysis
queries to determine who can impersonate the service accounts that have the
specified access to the specified resources. Policy Analyzer runs one
query for each service account in query results. These queries analyze who has
any of the following permissions on the service account:
iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken
iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken
iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation
iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob
iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt
Quotas and limits
Cloud Asset Inventory enforces the rate of incoming requests, including policy
analysis requests, based on the consumer project. Cloud Asset Inventory also
limits group expansion within the group memberships and resource expansion
within the resource hierarchy.
To see the default quotas and limits for Policy Analyzer, see Quotas
and limits in the Cloud Asset Inventory documentation.
Pricing
Each organization can execute up to 20
analysis queries per day for no charge. This limit includes both allow policy
analysis and organization policy analysis.
If you want to execute more than 20 analysis
queries per day, you must have an organization-level activation of the Premium
or Enterprise tier of Security Command Center . For more information, see
Billing questions .
