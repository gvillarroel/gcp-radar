— Credential strength policy
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
A key principle of Chrome Enterprise Premium is "Access to services is granted based on
what we know about you and your device." The level of access given to a single
user or a single device is dynamically inferred by interrogating multiple
data sources. This level of trust can then be used as part of the decision
process.
A key element to the trust evaluation process is the strength of the user's
login credentials, where access to specific types of applications is determined
by how the user authenticated to the system. For example, users logged in with
just a password can only access applications that do not contain any sensitive
information, whereas a user logged in with a hardware security key as a
second factor can access the most sensitive enterprise applications.
Credential strength based policies is a feature that allows an enterprise to
enable access controls based on the strength of the credential used during the
authentication process. By leveraging credential strength as another condition
in access control policies, enterprises can enforce access controls based on the
usage of hardware security keys, 2-step verification or other forms of strong
credentials.
Note: To use the credential strength feature, you must be a Chrome Enterprise Premium Enterprise (managed) user.
Credential strength policy overview
Access Context Manager allows Google Cloud organization administrators to define
fine-grained, attribute based access control for projects and resources in
Google Cloud.
Access levels are used for permitting access to resources based on contextual
information about the request. Using access levels, you can start to organize
tiers of trust. For example, you might create an access level called High_Level
that will permit requests from a small group of highly-privileged individuals.
You might also identify a more general group to trust, such as an IP range that
you want to permit requests from. In that case, you might create an access level
called Medium_Level to permit those requests.
Access Context Manager provides two ways to define access levels: basic and
custom. The credential strength check currently utilizes custom access levels.
The information about the credential strength used during user authentication is
captured during the Google login process. That information is captured and
stored in Google's sessions storage service.
Credential strength check is currently supported for Identity-Aware Proxy, Identity-Aware Proxy for TCP, and Google Workspace.
Configuring credential strength policy
You can use an Access Context Manager custom access
level definition to set the appropriate policies. Custom access levels use
boolean expressions written in a subset of Common Expression Language (CEL) to
test the attributes of a client making a request.
In the Google Cloud console, you can configure custom access levels in the Advanced
Mode when creating an access level. To create a custom access level, complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, open the Access Context Manager page .
If you are prompted, select your organization.
At the top of the Access Context Manager page, click New .
In the New Access Level pane, complete the following steps:
In the Access level title box, enter a title for the access level. The title must be at most 50 characters, start with a letter, and can contain only numbers, letters, underscores, and spaces.
For Create Conditions in , select Advanced Mode .
In the Conditions section , enter the expressions for your custom access level.The condition must resolve to a single boolean value. For examples and more information about Common Expression Language (CEL) support and custom access levels, see the Custom access level specification .
Click Save .
Supported credential strength values
Value
Google Definition
Example Custom Access Level
pwd
User authenticated with a password.
request. auth. claims. crd_ str. pwd == true
push
User authenticated with a push notification to the mobile device.
request. auth. claims. crd_ str. push == true
sms
User authenticated using a code sent to SMS or via a phone call.
request. auth. claims. crd_ str. sms == true
swk
2SV used a software key, such as a phone, as security key.
request. auth. claims. crd_ str. swk == true
hwk
2SV used a hardware key, such as Google Titan Key.
request. auth. claims. crd_ str. hwk == true
otp
User authenticated with one time password methods (Google Authenticator and Backup Codes).
request. auth. claims. crd_ str. otp == true
mfa
User authenticated with any of the methods in this table except pwd .
request. auth. claims. crd_ str. mfa == true
Additional information about 2-step verification
Google 2-Step Verification has a feature that allows users to mark their device as trusted and avoid the need for additional 2-step challenges when signing in again on the same device. When this feature is enabled, a user who signs out and signs back in does not receive a 2-step challenge on the second sign-in, and Google would correctly report the credential strength for the second sign-in as password-only, and not Multi-Factor Authentication, since a 2-step challenge was not used on the second sign-in.
If you have applications or workflows that depend on requiring the user to always use strong credentials, you might want to disable the trusted device feature. For information about enabling or disabling the trusted device feature, see Add or remove trusted computers . Note that disabling the feature will require users to present their second factors every time they sign in, even on frequently used devices. Users might have to sign out and sign back in for their most recent sign-in to have Multi-Factor Authentication assertions.
