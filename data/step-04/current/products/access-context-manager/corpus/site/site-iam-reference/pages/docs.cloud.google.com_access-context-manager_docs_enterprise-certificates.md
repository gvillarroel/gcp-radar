Troubleshooting your configuration
A key principle of Chrome Enterprise Premium is that access to services is granted based on
what we know about you and your device. The level of access given to a single
user or a single device is dynamically inferred by interrogating multiple data
sources. Chrome Enterprise Premium uses this level of trust as part of its decision process.
Access Context Manager is the zero trust policy engine of Chrome Enterprise Premium. Access Context Manager lets
you define fine-grained, attribute-based access control for applications and
Google Cloud resources.
Use access levels to permit access to resources based on contextual information
about the request. By using access levels, you can start to organize tiers of
trust. For example, you might create an access level called High_Level that
permits requests from a small group of highly-privileged individuals. You might
also identify a more general group to trust, such as an IP address range that
you want to permit requests from. In that case, you might create an access level
called Medium_Level to permit those requests.
One of the key requirements for zero trust access is to only allow access when
the device is managed or owned by the company. There are several ways to
determine whether a device is a corporate owned. One way is to determine
whether a valid certificate, issued by the company, is on the device. An
enterprise certificate on a device can indicate that it's corporate owned.
Enterprise certificates for Context-Aware Access is a feature of the overall
Chrome Enterprise Premium certificate-based access solution. This feature uses device
certificates as an alternative context-aware signal to determine whether a
device is a corporate-owned asset. This feature is supported on Chrome browser
version 110 or later.
Because a device can have more than one certificate, you can access enterprise
certificates in the custom access level through the macros .exist(e,p) :
See more code actions.
Light code theme
Dark code theme
device.certificates.exists(cert, predicate)
In the example, cert is an identifier used in predicate , which binds to the
device certificate. The exists() macro combines per-element predicate results
with the "or" (||) operator, meaning that macros return true if at least one
certificate satisfies the predicate expression.
The certificate has the following attributes that can be checked together. Note
that string comparisons are case-sensitive.
Attribute
Description
Example predicate expression
(where cert is an identifier of macros)
is_ valid
True if the certificate is valid and not expired (boolean).
You can't use this attribute with Endpoint Verification, because Endpoint Verification
doesn't check certificate revocation.
cert. is_ valid
cert_ fingerprint
Fingerprint of the certificate (base64 unpadded SHA256).
The fingerprint is the unpadded base64 encoded SHA256 digest, in
binary format, of the DER-encoded certificate. You can generate the
string from the certificate in PEM format using the following
procedure with OpenSSL:
$ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -out cert.der -outform DER
$ openssl dgst -sha256 -binary cert.der > digest.sha
$ openssl base64 -in digest.sha | tr -d =
cert. cert_ fingerprint == origin. client Cert Fingerprint()
root_ ca_ fingerprint
Fingerprint of the Root CA certificate used to sign the certificate
(base64 unpadded SHA256).
The fingerprint is the unpadded base64-encoded SHA256 digest, in
binary format, of the DER-encoded certificate. You can generate the
string from the certificate in PEM format using the following
procedure with OpenSSL:
$ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -out cert.der -outform DER
$ openssl dgst -sha256 -binary cert.der > digest.sha
$ openssl base64 -in digest.sha | tr -d =
cert. root_ ca_ fingerprint == "the_ fingerprint"
issuer
Issuer name (fully expanded names).
To find the issuer name, you can use the following approach:
Run the following command on the certificate:
$ openssl x509 -in ca_ 1. crt -issuer
issuer= / C=IN/ ST=UP/ L=NCR/ O=BCEDemo/ OU=BCEDemo_ 1/ CN=inter_ 1/ email Address=test_ inter1@beyondcorp. in
To get the issuer string for the access level, reverse the output and replace
each forward slash (/) with a comma (,):
EMAILADDRESS=test_inter1@beyondcorp.in, CN=inter_1, OU=BCEDemo_1, O=BCEDemo, L=NCR, ST=UP, C=IN
cert. issuer == "EMAILADDRESS=test_ inter1@beyondcorp. in, CN=inter_ 1, OU=BCEDemo_ 1, O=BCEDemo, L=NCR, ST=UP, C=IN"
subject
Subject name of the certificate (fully expanded names).
cert. subject == "CA_ SUB"
serial_ number
Serial number of the certificate (string).
cert. serial_ number = "123456789"
template_ id
Template ID of the X.509 extension Certificate Template for the certificate (string).
cert. template_ id = "1. 3. 6. 1. 4. 1. 311. 21. 8. 15608621. 11768144. 5720724. 16068415. 6889630. 81. 2472537. 7784047"
The following table contains examples of policies that you can set:
Example Policy
Expression
The device has a valid certificate signed by the company root
certificate.
device.certificates.exists(cert, cert.is_valid && cert.root_ca_fingerprint == "ROOT_CA_FINGERPRINT")
The device has a valid certificate issued by issuer
CA_ABC .
device.certificates.exists(cert, cert.is_valid && cert.issuer == "EMAILADDRESS=test_inter1@beyondcorp.in, CN=inter_1, OU=BCEDemo_1, O=BCEDemo, L=NCR, ST=UP, C=IN")
Important: Endpoint Verification reports a single enterprise device certificate to the
Admin console, even if multiple certificates are on a device.
This means that, regardless of how many enterprise certificates your
device has, the Admin console displays only one.
Configuring enterprise certificates
Before configuring enterprise certificates, make sure that you've configured
custom access levels. For instructions, see Creating a custom access
level .
You can use an Access Context Manager custom access level definition to set the
appropriate policies. Custom access levels use boolean expressions written in a
subset of Common Expression Language
(CEL) to test the attributes of a
client making a request.
Important: For Windows devices, install the client certificate in the user
certificate store, not in the computer certificate store. If the client
certificate is installed in the computer certificate store, authenticated users
must be able to read but not export its private key container for mTLS signing.
Uploading trust anchors in the Admin console
For Chrome Enterprise Premium to collect and validate the device enterprise certificate, you
must upload the trust anchors and any intermediary certificates that are used to
issue the device certificate. The trust anchors are the self-signed root CA
(Certification Authority) certificate and the relevant intermediate and
subordinate certificates. Complete the following steps to upload the trust
anchors:
Go to the Admin console and navigate to
Devices > Networks > Certificates .
Select the appropriate organizational unit.
Select Add Certificate .
Enter the certificate name.
Upload the certificate.
Enable the Endpoint Verification checkbox.
Click Add .
Ensure that users belong to the organizational unit that the trust anchors
are uploaded for.
Configure an AutoSelectCertificateForUrls policy
For Endpoint Verification to search the device certificate and collect it through Chrome,
you must configure the AutoSelectCertificateForURLs policy by completing the
following steps:
Ensure that the Chrome browser is managed by Chrome Browser Cloud Management.
For Windows, macOS, and Linux, set up the cloud-managed Chrome browser
using the Chrome Enterprise Code. For instructions, see Sign up Chrome Enterprise Core .
Enroll your device to allow your organization to centrally manage that
device. For instructions, see Enroll cloud-managed Chrome browsers .
In the Admin console, add the AutoSelectCertificateForUrls policy:
Go to the Admin console and navigate to
Devices > Chrome > Settings > User &
Browser Settings > Client certificates .
Select the appropriate organizational unit.
Add a policy AutoSelectCertificateForUrls , based on the following example:
{"pattern":"https://[*.]clients6.google.com","filter":{"ISSUER":{"CN":" CERTIFICATE_ISSUER_NAME "}}}
Replace CERTIFICATE_ISSUER_NAME with the common
name of the issuer CA.
Do not modify the value of pattern .
Note: Make sure that the filter refers to the issuer certificate that you
uploaded in the previous steps.
To verify the policy configuration, complete the following steps:
Navigate to chrome://policy in the browser.
Verify the configured value for AutoSelectCertificateForUrls .
Ensure that the policy Applies to value is set to Machine . On the
Chrome operating system, the value is applied to Current User .
Ensure that the Status for the policy does not have a Conflict .
Troubleshooting your configuration
Review the certificate attributes on the device details page to ensure that
they're listed correctly.
You can use the Endpoint Verification logs to help you troubleshoot any issues. To
download the Endpoint Verification logs, complete the following steps:
Right-click the Endpoint Verification extension and then go to Options .
Select Log level > All > Download Logs .
Open a support case with Cloud Customer Care and share the logs for further
debugging.
