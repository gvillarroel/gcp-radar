What's next
This page describes how to enable
certificate-based access (CBA)
with your enterprise certificates.
If you don't have a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), you can use
certificates provisioned by Endpoint Verification .
An important requirement of the zero trust access model is to only allow access
to authorized devices. Context-Aware Access CBA uses certificates and their
private keys stored in a secure keystore on the device to determine whether the
device is authorized. To enable this feature, complete the following procedures.
Before you begin
Ensure that you have created CBA access levels for your Google Cloud project. If you need to create access levels,
see Create access levels for certificate-based access .
Ensure that you enforce CBA on your Google Cloud resources using one of the following methods:
(Recommended) Enforce certificate-based access with Context-Aware Access policies :
Configure rules around users.
Enforce certificate-based access with VPC Service Controls :
Configure rules around data.
When you enforce CBA on your Google Cloud resources, accessing your
Google Cloud resources requires an authorized user to also present a valid
device certificate.
Upload the trust anchors
To allow Context-Aware Access to collect and validate the enterprise certificate of a
device, you must upload the trust anchors that are used to issue the device
certificate. The trust anchors are the self-signed root CA certificate and the
relevant intermediate and subordinate certificates. To upload the trust anchors,
complete the following steps:
In the Google Admin console , go to
Devices > Networks > Certificates , and then select the organizational
unit for which to upload the trust anchors. Ensure that the organizational
unit you select contains the users to which you want to grant access.
Select Add Certificate , and then enter a name for your root certificate.
Click Upload to upload the certificate.
Select Enable the Endpoint Verification , and then click Add .
The certificate to be uploaded should be the CA certificate, which is
the issuer of the client certificates installed on your corporate devices. If your
company doesn't have a CA certificate and the corresponding client certificates,
you can create them through the Google Cloud
Certificate Authority Service .
The steps to install client certificates into native keystores are different for
each operating system and are outside of the scope of this document.
Configure users' Chrome browser to use your enterprise certificate
Follow the instructions at Set Up Endpoint Verification to install
the Endpoint Verification extension for Chrome for all users in your organization. This extension syncs
certificate metadata to Google Cloud's backend.
After you set up the browser extension, configure the AutoSelectCertificateForURLs Chrome policy to
allow Endpoint Verification to search for the device certificate and collect it through Chrome.
Ensure that Chrome Browser Cloud Management manages the
users' Chrome browser.
Set up Chrome Browser Cloud Management
In the Admin console, add the AutoSelectCertificateForUrls policy:
Go to Devices > Chrome > Settings > User & Browser Settings > Client
certificates .
Select the appropriate organizational unit.
Add a policy.
The following example adds the AutoSelectCertificateForUrls policy:
{"pattern":"https://[*.]clients6.google.com","filter":{"ISSUER":{"CN":"CERT_ISSUER"}}}
{"pattern":"https://console-secure.cloud.google.com","filter":{"ISSUER":{"CN":"CERT_ISSUER"}}}
{"pattern":"https://storage.mtls.cloud.google.com","filter":{"ISSUER":{"CN":"CERT_ISSUER"}}}
In the example, CERT_ISSUER is the common name of your CA certificate.
After this configuration, users can access protected Google Cloud resources
with the Chrome browser at console-secure.cloud.google.com .
Verify policy configuration (optional)
In the Chrome browser, enter chrome://policy .
Verify that AutoSelectCertificateForUrls is listed under
Chrome Policies .
Verify that the value for Applies to is Machine . On ChromeOS, the
value for Applies to is Current User .
Ensure that the Status for the policy does not have a Conflict .
If the status does have a conflict, see Understand Chrome policy management for information.
Configure command-line tools to use your enterprise certificate
If users in your organization need to access Google Cloud resources from
the command line, they must complete the following procedures to enable CBA with
your enterprise certificate in their command-line tools.
Supported command-line tools include the following:
Google Cloud CLI
Terraform CLI (gcloud CLI is required to install and
configure helper components.
Because the device certificates are stored in native keystores, the
Google Cloud CLI is bundled with an open source component called Enterprise
Certificate Proxy (ECP) to interact with key management APIs.
If you're using a Windows system, you must have the Visual Studio C++ runtime library installed .
Supported operating systems and their respective built-in keystores include the
following:
macOS with Keychain
Microsoft Windows with CryptoAPI
Linux with PKCS #11
ECP must be configured with the necessary metadata information to locate the
certificate in the keystores.
Install and configure ECP with the Google Cloud CLI
Install the Google Cloud CLI and enable CBA .
Install with the bundled python option enabled.
For macOS and Linux, run the install.sh script after downloading it:
$ ./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
Install the ECP helper component with the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud components install enterprise-certificate-proxy
Initialize ECP certificate configuration with the Google Cloud CLI:
Linux macOS Windows
More
$ gcloud auth enterprise-certificate-config create linux
--label=<CERT_LABEL> --module=<PKCS11_MODULE_PATH> --slot=<SLOT_ID>
Example:
$ gcloud auth enterprise-certificate-config create linux
--label="Google Endpoint Verification" --module=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/libcredentialkit_pkcs11.so.0 --slot=0x1234567
$ gcloud auth enterprise-certificate-config create macos
--issuer=<CERT_ISSUER>
Example:
$ gcloud auth enterprise-certificate-config create macos
--issuer="Google Endpoint Verification"
$ gcloud auth enterprise-certificate-config create windows
--issuer=<CERT_ISSUER> --provider=<PROVIDER> --store=<STORE>
Example:
$ gcloud auth enterprise-certificate-config create windows
--issuer="Google Endpoint Verification" --provider=current_user --store=MY
The ECP configuration can also be manually configured. It is stored as a JSON
file at the following location on the user's device:
Linux and macOS: ~/.config/gcloud/certificate_config.json
Windows: %APPDATA%\gcloud\certificate_config.json
See the
ECP documentation on GitHub
for additional examples of the configuration and schema.

}
After this configuration, users can access protected Google Cloud resources
using command-line tools by enabling the CBA flag.
To enable CBA for the Google Cloud CLI, run the following command to set the
context_aware/use_client_certificate property to true :
$ gcloud config set context_aware/use_client_certificate true
To enable CBA for all other command-line tools, including Terraform, set the
environment variable GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE to true .
