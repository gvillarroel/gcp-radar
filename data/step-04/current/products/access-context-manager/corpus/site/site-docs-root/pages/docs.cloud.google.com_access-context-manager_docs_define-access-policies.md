Define access policies using access levels
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to define Context-Aware Access policies using access
levels.
An access level
is a set of attributes assigned to requests based on their origin. Using
information such as device type, IP address, and user identity, you can
designate what level of access to grant. For example, you might assign a
High_Trust level to connections from within your corporate network and a
Medium_Trust level to external devices running approved operating systems.
An access policy is a container for all of your Access Context Manager resources, such as
access levels and service perimeters.
For more information about access levels and access policies, see the
Access Context Manager overview .
Limitations
When defining an access level, the following limitations apply:
You can't use an IP address as an attribute for Docker connections, nor can
you use private IP addresses when connecting to private clusters using kubectl
or a managed Looker instance.
Looker Studio is always allowed unrestricted access to the
Google Cloud APIs, regardless of Access Context Manager policies.
Device attributes aren't available for non-Google OAuth client applications.
You can't use a scoped access level .
Define your policy using access levels
Console
Create a basic access level:
In the Google Cloud console, open the Access Context Manager page.
Go to the Access Context Manager page
If you are prompted, select a project.
On the Access Context Manager page, click New .
In the New Access Level pane, do the following:
In the Access level title field, enter a title for the access level.
The title must be at most 50 characters, start with a letter, and can
contain only numbers, letters, underscores, and spaces.
In the Conditions section, click the
add button for the type
of attribute you want to add, and then provide
the values you want applied to that attribute.
For a complete list of the attributes that you can add,
see access level attributes .
For example, if you want the access level to consider where a
request is coming from within your network, you would select the
IP Subnetworks attribute.
Repeat this step to add multiple attributes to the same condition.
When a condition has multiple attributes, all of the attributes must
be met by the access request.
An access level condition can include one of each type of
attribute. Some attributes include additional
options, such as the Device Policy attribute.
Access levels support conditions based on user identity. However, to
add identities to a condition, you must create or update the access
level using the gcloud CLI or the API.
Use the When condition is met, return option to specify whether
you want the condition to require that a request meet all
specified attributes ( TRUE ) or whether the request must
meet anything but those attributes ( FALSE ).
For example, if you want to deny requests from a certain IP address
range of your network, specify the IP address range using the
IP Subnetworks attribute and then set the condition to
FALSE .
Optionally, click Add another condition to add an
additional condition to your access level and then repeat
the previous two steps.
For example, if you want to deny access to a subset of IP
addresses within a broader IP address range, create a new
condition, specify the subset IP address range for the
IP Subnetworks attribute, and set the condition to return
FALSE .
Repeat this step to add multiple conditions to the same access
level.
If you created more than one condition, use
Combine condition with to specify whether you want the
access level to require a request to meet at least one of the
conditions ( OR ), or all of the conditions ( AND ).
Click Save .
gcloud
If you don't have an access policy for your organization,
create one
before continuing.
Use the gcloud access-context-manager levels create
command to create an access level:
gcloud access-context-manager levels create LEVEL_NAME OPTIONS \
--policy = POLICY
Replace the following:
LEVEL_NAME : The unique name for the access level. It must
begin with a letter and include only letters, numbers, and
underscores. The name can be a maximum of 50 characters.
OPTIONS : The required options from the following table.
Options
basic-level-spec
A YAML file that specifies one or
more conditions for the access level.
title
A short title for the access level. The access level's title
is displayed in the Google Cloud console.
combine-function
(Optional) Determines how conditions are combined.
Valid values: AND , OR
description
(Optional) A long-form description of the access level.
POLICY : The ID of your organization's access policy.
If you have a default policy set, this parameter is optional.
Optionally, you can include any of the
gcloud flags .
basic-level-spec YAML file
When you use the gcloud CLI to create an access level, you must
provide a YAML
file for the basic-level-spec option. The YAML file defines one or more
conditions for the access level. Conditions must contain at least one
attribute. When a condition contains more than one attribute, they are
combined as either an AND operation (all must be true) or as a NAND
operation (none can be true), depending on whether the negate attribute
is included in the condition.
For a complete list of the attributes that you can include in your YAML file,
see access level attributes .
For more information about access levels and YAML,
refer to the example YAML for an access level .
Example command
gcloud access-context-manager levels create Device_Trust \
--basic-level-spec = corpdevspec.yaml \
--combine-function = AND \
--description = 'Access level that conforms to corporate spec.' \
--title = 'Device_Trust Extended' \
--policy = 1521580097614100
API
If you don't have an access policy for your organization,
create one
before continuing.
To create an access level, call accessLevels.create .
POST https://accesscontextmanager.googleapis.com/v1/accessPolicies/ POLICY /accessLevels
POLICY is the ID of your organization's access policy.
Request body
The request body must include an AccessLevel
resource that specifies the conditions you want for the new access level.
Each Condition has one or more attributes that are
evaluated as an AND operation (all must be true) or as a
NAND operation (none can be true) depending on whether the negate
field is set to true . The resulting evaluation determines whether the
condition is met or not.
Response body
If successful, the response body for the call contains an
Operation resource that provides details about the
POST operation.
Common policy configurations
The following examples cover a few of the practical ways your organization might
want to implement access levels. The examples assume your organization already
has an access policy .
Limit access on a corporate network
This example describes how to create an access level condition that allows
access only from a specified range of IP addresses (for example, those within a
corporate network).
By restricting the range of IP addresses that are granted access, you can
make exfiltrating data more difficult for an attacker that is inside or outside
your organization.
For this example, assume you want to create an access level that will allow a
group of internal auditors to access the Cloud Logging service for a
project named sensitive-data . All of the devices for the auditors are
assigned IPs on a subnet ranging between 203.0.113.0 and 203.0.113.127. You
know there won't be any devices assigned to that subnet other than those
used by the auditors.
If you want to use a private IP address range (for example, 192.168.0.0/16
or 172.16.0.0/12 ), see Allow access to protected resources from an internal
IP address for additional
information and an example implementation using VPC Service Controls.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, open the Access Context Manager.
Go to the Access Context Manager page
If you are prompted, select project.
At the top of the Access Context Manager page, click New .
In the New Access Level pane, in the Conditions section, click
Add attribute and then click IP Subnetworks .
In the IP Subnetworks box, select either Public IP or Private
IP .
If you select Public IP , enter one or more IPv4 or IPv6 ranges
formatted as CIDR blocks.
In this example, to limit access to only the auditors, enter
203.0.113.0/25 in the IP Subnetworks box.
If you select Private IP , click Select VPC networks . You can
specify VPC networks using one of the three options
available in the Import options list.
Option 1:
Select Browse for VPC networks in your organization and select the
VPC networks.
Click Add selected VPC networks .
Click Select IP subnets and select the subnets.
Click Add IP subnets .
Option 2:
Select Manually enter VPC network address and enter one or more
VPC networks.
Click Add VPC network .
Click Select IP subnets and select the subnets.
Click Add IP subnets .
Option 3:
Select Upload CSV file (overwrites existing networks) .
If you use a CSV file to add VPC networks and subnets
to an access level, Access Context Manager overwrites the previously selected VPC
networks and subnets.
Click Browse and upload the CSV file. In the CSV file, you must specify
the VPC networks and subnets in the following format:
VPC_NETWORK_NAME_1 | IP_RANGE_1 | IP_RANGE_2 | ...
VPC_NETWORK_NAME_2 | . | . | ...
. | . | . | ...
. | . | . | ...
Click Import networks .
Using the CSV file, Access Context Manager populates the VPC network
names and subnet information in the VPC network address and IP
subnetworks boxes respectively.
For information about the VPC network name and private
IP address format, see Use internal IP address in access
levels .
Click Save .
gcloud
Create a YAML file for an access level that includes one or more
IPv4 or IPv6 ranges formatted as CIDR blocks.
In this example, to limit access to only the auditors, you would enter
the following into the YAML file:
- ipSubnetworks :
- 203.0.113.0/25
If you want to use a private IP address, you need to enter the following
information in the YAML file:
- vpcNetworkSources :
- vpcSubnetwork :
network : VPC_NETWORK_NAME
vpcIpSubnetworks :
- IP_RANGE
Replace VPC_NETWORK_NAME and IP_RANGE with the values
described in the Use internal IP address in access
levels section.
Save the file. In this example, the file is named CONDITIONS.yaml .
Create the access level.
gcloud access-context-manager levels create NAME \
--title TITLE \
--basic-level-spec CONDITIONS.yaml \
--policy = POLICY
Replace the following:
NAME : The unique name for the access level. It must
begin with a letter and include only letters, numbers, and
underscores.
TITLE : A human-readable title. It must be unique to the
policy.
POLICY : The ID of your organization's
access policy. If you have a default policy set, this parameter is
optional.
You should see output similar to the following:
Create request issued for: NAME
Waiting for operation [accessPolicies/ POLICY /accessLevels/ NAME /create/1521594488380943] to complete...done.
Created level NAME .
API
Craft a request body to create an AccessLevel
resource that includes one or more IPv4 or IPv6 ranges formatted
as CIDR blocks.
In this example, to limit access to only the auditors, you would enter
the following into the request body:
{
"name" : " NAME " ,
"title" : " TITLE " ,
"basic" : {
"conditions" : [
{
"ipSubnetworks" : [
"203.0.113.0/25"
]
}
]
}
}
Replace the following:
NAME : The unique name for the access level. It must
begin with a letter and include only letters, numbers, and
underscores.
TITLE : A human-readable title. It must be unique to the
policy.
If you want to use a private IP address, you need to enter the following
information in the request body:
{
"name" : " NAME " ,
"title" : " TITLE " ,
"basic" : {
"conditions" : [
{
"vpcNetworkSources" : [
{
"vpcSubnetwork" : {
"network" : VPC_NETWORK_NAME ,
"vpcIpSubnetworks" : [
IP_RANGE
]
}
}
]
}
]
}
}
Replace VPC_NETWORK_NAME and IP_RANGE with the values
described in the Use internal IP address in access
levels section.
Create the access level by calling accessLevels.create .
POST https://accesscontextmanager.googleapis.com/v1/accessPolicies/ POLICY /accessLevels
POLICY is the ID of your organization's access policy.
After you create the access level, you must apply it using an
access binding
for it to be enforced.
Limit access by device attributes
Note: This feature is available only with Chrome Enterprise Premium . To purchase a Chrome Enterprise Premium subscription,
contact sales.
This example describes how to create an access level that grants access only to
devices which meet a specified set of requirements, like a certain operating
system (OS) version.
Information about devices is provided to Access Context Manager using
Endpoint Verification .
The following criteria can be checked when determining whether to grant access:
Screen lock is enabled
Storage encryption is enabled
Device is running a specified operating system kind and version
For this example, assume your organization uses only machines that have either
ChromeOS or Windows installed. To add a layer of security, you want to create
an access level that will prevent access by anyone using other operating
systems. Additionally, to manage risk, you want to make sure that only certain
versions of the OSes can gain access.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, open the Access Context Manager page.
Go to the Access Context Manager page
If you are prompted, select a project.
At the top of the Access Context Manager page, click New .
In the New Access Level pane, in the Conditions section,
click Add attribute and then click Device Policy .
Add the device policy attributes:
Click Add OS Policy and then click Chrome OS Policy .
In the Minimum version box, enter the minimum version of
ChromeOS you want to allow.
Repeat steps 1 and 2 for Windows OS Policy .
Click Save .
gcloud
Create a YAML file for an access level that includes a device policy with
OS constraints.
In this example, to allow only devices with a minimum acceptable version
of ChromeOS and Windows, you would enter the following into the YAML
file:
- devicePolicy :
osConstraints :
- osType : DESKTOP_CHROME_OS
minimumVersion : 11316.165.0
- osType : DESKTOP_WINDOWS
minimumVersion : 10.0.1809
Save the file. In this example, the file is named CONDITIONS.yaml .
Create the access level.
gcloud access-context-manager levels create NAME \
--title TITLE \
--basic-level-spec CONDITIONS.yaml \
--policy = POLICY
Replace the following:
NAME : The unique name for the access level. It must
begin with a letter and include only letters, numbers, and
underscores.
TITLE : A human-readable title. It must be unique to the
policy.
POLICY : The ID of your organization's
access policy. If you have a default policy set, this parameter is
optional.
You should see output similar to the following:
Create request issued for: NAME
Waiting for operation [accessPolicies/ POLICY /accessLevels/ NAME /create/1521594488380943] to complete...done.
Created level NAME .
API
Craft a request body to create an AccessLevel
resource that includes a device policy with OS constraints.
In this example, to allow only devices with a minimum acceptable version
of ChromeOS and Windows, you would enter the following into the request
body:
{
"name" : " NAME " ,
"title" : " TITLE " ,
"basic" : {
"conditions" : [
{
"devicePolicy" : {
"osConstraints" : [
{
"osType" : "DESKTOP_CHROME_OS" ,
"minimumVersion" : "11316.165.0"
},
{
"osType" : "DESKTOP_WINDOWS" ,
"minimumVersion" : "10.0.1809"
}
]
{
}
]
}
}
Replace the following:
NAME : The unique name for the access level. It must
begin with a letter and include only letters, numbers, and
underscores.
TITLE : A human-readable title. It must be unique to the
policy.
Create the access level by calling accessLevels.create .
POST https://accesscontextmanager.googleapis.com/v1/accessPolicies/ POLICY /accessLevels
POLICY is the ID of your organization's access policy.
After you create the access level, you must apply it using an
access binding
for it to be enforced.
Limit access to trusted corporate devices with valid certificates
You can use certificate-based access
(CBA)
to require verified X.509 certificates for access to Google Cloud
resources. The additional credential provides a stronger signal of device
identity and helps protect your organization from credential theft or accidental
loss by requiring that both the user credentials and the original device
certificate are present before granting access.
Before continuing, ensure that the Endpoint Verification Chrome extension and the
Endpoint Verification helper app are deployed on all of the devices that require access to
Google Cloud resources. These become trusted devices to which you can
grant access. See
Deploy Endpoint Verification to use with certificate-based access
for details.
To create a policy that requires certificate-based access, you must have an
access level with a
custom access level specification .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, open the Access Context Manager page.
Go to the Access Context Manager page
If you are prompted, select a project.
Click Create access level .
In the New access level pane, select Advanced mode . You must have
a Chrome Enterprise Premium license to use this mode.
In the Conditions section, enter the following expression in the
CEL expression box.
certificateBindingState(origin, device) == CertificateBindingState.CERT_MATCHES_EXISTING_DEVICE
Click Save .
gcloud
Create a YAML file for an access level that includes certificate
enforcement.
expression : "certificateBindingState(origin, device) == CertificateBindingState.CERT_MATCHES_EXISTING_DEVICE"
Save the file. In this example, the file is named CONDITIONS.yaml .
Create the access level.
gcloud access-context-manager levels create NAME \
--title TITLE \
--basic-level-spec CONDITIONS.yaml \
--policy = POLICY
Replace the following:
NAME : The unique name for the access level. The name must begin
with a letter and include only letters, numbers, and underscores.
TITLE : A human-readable title. It must be unique to the policy.
POLICY : The ID of your organization's access policy. If you
have a default policy set, this parameter is optional.
You should see output similar to the following:
Create request issued for : NAME
Waiting for operation [ accessPolicies/POLICY/accessLevels/NAME/create/1234 ] to complete...done.
Created level NAME.
API
Create a request body file for an access level that includes a device
policy with OS constraints.
