Manage access bindings
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to manage your existing access bindings, which define how
access policies are applied to your user groups. You can view, modify, and
delete these bindings as needed. Access bindings determine how access levels and
session controls are applied to a user group.
For information about how to create access bindings and for more details on
access levels and session controls, see Apply policies to user groups
with access bindings .
Preview
— Session controls feature only
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
View access bindings
After the access bindings are created for a group of users, access to the
Google Cloud console and Google Cloud APIs are controlled based
on satisfaction of the bound access level.
You can view the details of the access binding that you created, edit it, or
delete it.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Access Context Manager page.
Go to Access Context Manager
If you are prompted, select a project. The list of access bindings are
listed on the Access Context Manager page.
gcloud
To view all access bindings, run the following command:
gcloud access-context-manager cloud-bindings list \
--organization ORG_ID
ORG_ID : Your organization ID.
If the access-context-manager/organization property hasn't been set,
replace ORG_ID in the optional --organization
flag with the ID for the organization that you used when creating the
GcpAccessAdmin role.
To view the details of an access binding, run the following command:
gcloud access-context-manager cloud-bindings describe \
--binding = BINDING_ID
BINDING_ID is the ID of the access-binding or fully qualified identifier for
the access binding.
API
View all access bindings:
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
ORG_ID is the ID for the organization that you used when creating the
GcpAccessAdmin role.
If the access-context-manager/organization property hasn't been set,
replace ORG_ID in the optional --organization
flag with the ID for the organization that you used when creating the
GcpAccessAdmin role.
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://accesscontextmanager.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG_ID /gcpUserAccessBindings
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ "https://accesscontextmanager.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG_ID /gcpUserAccessBindings"
PowerShell
Note:

}
Update an access binding
You can update an access binding to do the following:
Add, remove, or change which applications have a policy.
Modify the access levels for an application within a user group.
Add a new dry run access level or promote an existing one to a live level.
Important: You can't change the user group after an access binding is created.
You must create a new access binding if you need to change the user group.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Access Context Manager page.
Go to Access Context Manager
If you are prompted, select a project.
On the Access Context Manager page, select an access binding and then click Edit
to update it.
You cannot update access bindings with dry run access levels or session
controls in the Google Cloud console.
gcloud
Create a YAML binding file.
gcloud access-context-manager cloud-bindings update
--binding ACCESS_BINDING
--binding-file BINDING_FILE_PATH
[ --level DEFAULT_ACCESS_LEVEL ]
[ --dry-run-level DEFAULT_DRY_RUN_ACCESS_LEVEL ]
[ --session-length = DEFAULT_SESSION_LENGTH ]
[ --session-reauth-method = DEFAULT_SESSION_REAUTH_METHOD ]
Replace the following:
ACCESS_BINDING is in the form
organizations/ ORG_ID /gcpUserAccessBindings/ ACCESS_BINDING_NAME .
BINDING_FILE_PATH : The path to the YAML file that contains the access binding scheme.
The binding file supports only scopedAccessSettings .
DEFAULT_ACCESS_LEVEL : The optional access level name, which takes the form
accessPolicies/POLICY_ID/accessLevels/ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME . Replace POLICY_ID
with the access policy ID, and ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME with the access level name.
DEFAULT_DRY_RUN_ACCESS_LEVEL_2 : An optional access level name in the form
`accessPolicies/POLICY_ID/accessLevels/ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME`.
Include this flag to apply the specified dry run access level to all applications by default if
they aren't specified in the YAML.
DEFAULT_SESSION_LENGTH : The optional session duration in the hour format,
such as 15h for 15 hours, or 2h for two hours.
DEFAULT_SESSION_REAUTH_METHOD : The optional method to challenge users to re-verify their
identity, which must be one of the following:
LOGIN : Apply the standard login, which can include MFA or other
Workspace-defined factors.
PASSWORD : Only require a password, even if other factors are defined. If passwords
are managed using an external IdP, users are redirected to the IdP. If the IdP session is live,
users are implicitly re-authenticated. If the IdP is not live, users must sign in through the IdP.
SECURITY_KEY : Require a hardware security key.
How the --level and --binding-file arguments work together
If you only use --binding-file , only the applications in the file
have the policies applied.
If you only use --level , the access level applies to all applications.
If you use both, the rules are combined. The --level
value applies to all applications, whereas the policies in the YAML file
specified by --binding-file only apply to the applications as defined
in the file.
Working with session controls
To set default session controls for all applications, use
--session-length and --session-reauth-method .
If you also define session controls in the YAML file, those session
controls override the default settings for those specific
applications.
You must use --session-length and --session-reauth-method
together.
To remove a default access level or a default dry run access level, provide an
empty string, such as --level= or --dry-run-level= . When these arguments
are not provided, the update command won't make any changes.
To remove a session control, set --session-length=0 .
API
Create a JSON body.
{
"accessLevels": [
" DEFAULT_ACCESS_LEVEL "
],
"scopedAccessSettings": [
{
"scope": {
"clientScope": {
"restrictedClientApplication": {
"clientId": " CLIENT_ID "
}
}
},
"activeSettings": {
"accessLevels": [
" ACCESS_LEVEL_A "
],
"sessionSettings": [
{
"sessionLength": " SESSION_LENGTH ",
"sessionReauthMethod": " SESSION_REAUTH_METHOD ",
"sessionLengthEnabled": true
}
]
}
},
{
"scope": {
"clientScope": {
"restrictedClientApplication": {
"name": " CLIENT_NAME "
}
},
"activeSettings": {
"accessLevels": [
" ACCESS_LEVEL_C "
]
}
}
}
]
}
Replace the following:
DEFAULT_ACCESS_LEVEL : The optional access level name, which takes the form
accessPolicies/POLICY_ID/accessLevels/ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME . Replace POLICY_ID
with the access policy ID, and ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME with the access level name.
CLIENT_ID : The OAuth client ID. You must use clientId when
an application contains sessionSettings .
ACCESS_LEVEL_A : An access level name in the format
accessPolicies/POLICY_ID/accessLevels/ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME .
SESSION_LENGTH : The session duration using ISO 8601 duration
format, such as 30m for 30 minutes, or 2h for
two hours.
SESSION_REAUTH_METHOD : The optional method to challenge users
to re-verify their identity, which must be one of the following:
LOGIN : Apply the standard login, which can include MFA or other
Workspace-defined factors.
PASSWORD : Only require a password, even if other factors are
defined. If passwords are managed using an external IdP, users are
redirected to the IdP. If the IdP session is live, users are implicitly
re-authenticated. If the IdP is not live, users must sign in through the
IdP.
SECURITY_KEY : Require a hardware security key.
CLIENT_NAME : The client name. If the application contains
sessionSettings , you cannot use the client name. Instead, use the
OAuth client ID.
ACCESS_LEVEL_C : An access level name in the format
accessPolicies/POLICY_ID/accessLevels/ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME .
Send the PATCH request.
PATCH https://accesscontextmanager.googleapis.com/v1/ ACCESS_BINDING ?fieldMask= FIELDMASK
Replace the following:
ACCESS_BINDING is in the form
organizations/ ORG_ID /gcpUserAccessBindings/ ACCESS_BINDING_NAME .
FIELD_MASK : A required, comma-separated list of fields that
you want to update. This tells the API which parts of the access binding
to modify.
fieldMask should contain the top-level JSON keys in the request body
that you want to update, which can contain accessLevels ,
dryRunAccessLevels , and scopedAccessSettings .
Important: If you don't include a fieldMask , nothing is updated.
If successful, you should receive a representation of the JSON object.
If there is a problem, you receive an error message.
