Custom access level specification
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page details the objects and attributes that are used to the build the
Common Expression Language (CEL)
expressions for custom access levels. Examples are included.
To learn more about CEL, see the
CEL language definition .
Note: For
CEL macros ,
custom access levels only support those documented on this page .
Objects
Access Context Manager provides four objects that contain access level attributes.
Objects
origin
Contains attributes that identify the origin of the request.
request.auth
Contains attributes that identify authentication and authorization
aspects of the request.
request.time
Contains time-based attributes that you can use to restrict access to resources based on the time of day, day of the week, or a specific date range.
levels
Contains attributes to define dependency on other access levels.
device
Contains attributes that describe the device the request originated
from.
origin attributes
This section lists the attributes supported by the origin object.
Attributes
ip
Type
string
Description
The IP address the request originated from. If the IP address
cannot be determined, origin.ip evaluates
to an error. We recommend that you use
inIpRange to check if the origin IP address is in a
specific IP address range instead of doing a string comparison.
Warning: Do not compare origin.ip
with the empty string. The behavior is undefined.
Example:
inIpRange ( origin.ip , [ "203.0.113.24" ])
region_code
Type
string
Description
The ISO
3166-1 alpha-2 code for the country or region where
the request originated from. If the region code cannot be
determined, origin.region_code evaluates
to an error.
Warning: Do not compare origin.region_code
with the empty string. The behavior is undefined.
Example:
origin.region_code == "GB"
origin.region_code in [ "US" , "FR" , "JP" ]

vendors
Type
map<string, Vendor> vendors;
Description
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
The vendors object is used to access data provided
by third-party security and endpoint management vendors. Each
vendor may populate three shared top-level attributes:
is_compliant_device ,
is_managed_device , and
device_health_score .
Additionally, vendors may provide their own keys and values
that are referenced using the data attribute.
The available keys for the data attribute vary
from vendor to vendor. Ensure that you are consistent when comparing the key value in your policy expression. For example, if you expect the key value to be a string or boolean, ensure that you compare it with a string or boolean in the policy expression correspondingly. Note that when the value is an integer, you should compare it with a double number in the policy expression.
To reference device state , use the format key-acme where acme is the organization's customer ID. You can get the customer ID from the GET https://www.googleapis.com/admin/directory/v1/customers/my_customer URL. The ID field in the response contains the customer ID starting with the letter C . Use the string after the letter C , excluding the letter C , for the customer ID.
Note: There is no complete list of available vendors and
vendor-specific keys.
Enum values:
// Health score of the device as provided by the vendor (possibly third party).
enum DeviceHealthScore {
// The health score for the device is not specified or unknown.
DEVICE_HEALTH_SCORE_UNSPECIFIED = 0 ;
// The health of the device is very poor.
VERY_POOR = 1 ;
// The health of the device is poor.
POOR = 2 ;
// The health of the device is ok.
NEUTRAL = 3 ;
// The health of the device is good.
GOOD = 4 ;
// The health of the device is very good.
VERY_GOOD = 5 ;
}
Examples:
device.vendors [ "some_vendor" ] . is_compliant_device == true
device.vendors [ "some_vendor" ] . is_managed_device == true
device.vendors [ "some_vendor" ] . device_health_score == DeviceHealthScore.VERY_GOOD
device.vendors [ "some_vendor" ] . data [ "is_device_compromised" ] == true
device.vendors [ "some_vendor" ] . data [ "some_num" ] == 1.0
Note: is_device_compromised is only an
example that represents a key defined by a vendor.

macros to iterate through the certificates and check their properties, such as validity.
Example:
// Checks if the device has at least one valid enterprise certificate.
device.certificates.exists ( cert , cert.is_valid == true )
Functions
Access Context Manager provides the following functions for use in the CEL
expressions for custom access levels.
Functions
inIpRange(address, [subnets])
Type
(string, list(string)) -< boolean
Description
Checks whether an IP address belongs to one of the given
subnets.
Warning: Do not use this function to check if the origin
IP address is in a specific private IP subnet. Private IP addresses within Google
are subject to change.
Example:
inIpRange ( origin.ip , [ "192.0.2.0/24" , "198.51.100.0/24" , "203.0.113.0/24" ])
device.versionAtLeast(minVersion)
Type
DeviceType.(string) -> boolean
Description
Checks whether the device operating system is at least a given
version. We recommend that you use this function with the
device.os_type attribute.
Example:
device.versionAtLeast ( "10.0" ) == true
certificateBindingState(origin, device)
Type
(Peer, DeviceType) -> integer
Description
Checks if the client certificate associated with the origin
matches the device and reports the state.
The state returned by the function can be one of the following:
CertificateBindingState.CERT_MATCHES_EXISTING_DEVICE
CertificateBindingState.CERT_NOT_MATCHING_EXISTING_DEVICE
CertificateBindingState.CERT_STATE_UNKNOWN
Example:
certificateBindingState ( origin , device ) == CertificateBindingState.CERT_MATCHES_EXISTING_DEVICE
startsWith()
Type
string.(string) -> bool
Description
Tests whether the string operand starts with the prefix argument.
Example:
"Sample string" . startsWith ( "Sample" )
endsWith()
Type
string.(string) -> bool
Description
Tests whether the string operand ends with the suffix argument.
Example:
"Sample string" . endsWith ( "string" )
origin.clientCertFingerprint()
Type
Origin.() -> string
Description
Returns the fingerprint of the certificate associated with the origin. You can use this in macros to test device certificates.
Example:
// Checks if the enterprise certificate associated with the origin matches the device.
device.certificates.exists ( cert , cert.is_valid && cert.cert_fingerprint == origin.clientCertFingerprint ())
Macros for CEL expressions
You can use the following macros in the CEL expressions for custom access levels:
Macro
Description
has(e.f)
Tests whether a field is available. See Field Selection for more details. Example:
has({"key": "value"}.key)
has(device.vendors.some_vendor)
e.all(x, p)
Tests whether a predicate holds for all elements of a list e or keys of a map e . Here x is an identifier to be used in p which binds to the element or key. The all() macro combines per-element predicate results with the and (&&) operator, so if any predicate evaluates to false, the macro evaluates to false, ignoring any errors from other predicates. Example:
This returns false because not all elements are greater than 1:
[1,2,3].all(x, x > 1)
e.exists(x, p)
Like the all() macro, but combines the predicate results with the or (||) operator. Example:
This returns true because there is at least one element in the list greater than 1:
[1,2,3].exists(x, x > 1)
Checks if the enterprise certificate associated with the device matches the issuer:
device.certificates.exists(cert, cert.is_valid && cert.issuer == "EMAILADDRESS=test_inter1@beyondcorp.in, CN=inter_1, OU=BCEDemo_1, O=BCEDemo, L=NCR, ST=UP, C=IN")
e.exists_one(x, p)
Like the exists() macro, but evaluates to true only if the predicate of exactly one element or key evaluates to true, and the rest to false. Any other combination of boolean results evaluates to false, and any predicate error causes the macro to raise an error. Example:
This returns false because more than one element is greater than 1:
[1,2,3].exists_one(x, x > 1)
Example CEL expressions
This section includes examples of CEL expressions used to create custom access
levels.
Example 1
device.encryption_status == DeviceEncryptionStatus.ENCRYPTED && ( origin.region_code in [ "US" ] || device.is_admin_approved_device )
This example represents an access level that requires the following conditions
be met in order to allow a request:
The device that the request originated from is encrypted.
One or more of the following is true:
The request originated in the United States.
The device that the request originated from is approved by the
domain administrator.
Example 2
( device.os_type == OsType.DESKTOP_WINDOWS && device.is_corp_owned_device ) || ( device.os_type == OsType.DESKTOP_MAC && device.is_admin_approved_device && device.versionAtLeast ( "10.11.0" ))
This example represents an access level that requires the following conditions
be met in order to allow a request:
One of the following is true:
The device that the request originated from uses a desktop Windows
operating system and is owned by your organization.
The device that the request originated from uses a desktop Mac
operating system, is approved by the domain administrator, and is
using at least MacOS 10.11.
Example 3
( certificateBindingState ( origin , device ) == CertificateBindingState.CERT_MATCHES_EXISTING_DEVICE )
This example represents an access level that requires the following condition
be met in order to allow a request:
The certificateBindingState extension function determines that the
certificate presented at request time matches one of the device
certificates that was registered when the device was enrolled in
endpoint verification .
