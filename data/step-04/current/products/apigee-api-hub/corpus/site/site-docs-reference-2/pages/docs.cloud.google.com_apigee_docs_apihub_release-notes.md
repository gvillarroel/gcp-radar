Deprecation of pull-based ingestion for Apigee plugins
Pull-based ingestion is no longer supported for Apigee and Apigee hybrid plugins as of July 31, 2025 . For existing projects that have pull-based Apigee X and hybrid plugins configured, these plugins will continue to function and will be automatically migrated to the push-based type starting August 2025 .
Deprecated
Deprecation of Apigee proxy deployment attributes
As of July 31st, 2025 , the Apigee X and Hybrid Environment and Apigee X and Hybrid Organization attributes will no longer be added to new Apigee proxy deployments. This change specifically applies when you import deployments into API hub by attaching a runtime project.
If your existing projects use these attributes in filtered search queries, we recommend updating them. To ensure your searches continue to work, use the Source project and Source environment fields as alternatives.
July 22, 2025
Change
API hub deprovisioning changes
Deprovisioning an API hub instance now also deletes any associated Apigee organizations from your Google Cloud project, provided those Apigee organizations have no Apigee instances.
If you deprovision an API hub instance, you can reprovision it later, but you'll need to wait 7 days before you can do so.
For more information, see Deprovision Apigee API hub .
Change
VPC Service Controls (VPC-SC) is GA
VPC Service Controls in API hub is now GA .
For more information, see VPC Service Controls for API hub .
Change
API hub provisioning now enables Apigee API
When you provision API hub, it now enables the Apigee API ( apigee.googleapis.com ) in your Google Cloud project. If Apigee isn't already provisioned, an Apigee organization is also automatically created in your project as part of the provisioning process.
API hub remains a free service. Enabling the Apigee API has no additional pricing or billing implications for your project.
For more information, see Provision API hub in the Cloud console .
July 18, 2025
Feature
Apigee and hybrid plugin instance management
You can now create and delete plugin instances for Apigee and Apigee Hybrid while associating the respective Apigee runtime projects to API hub.
For more information, see Auto-register Apigee proxies .
Breaking
Apigee and Apigee hybrid plugin creation now requires source project ID
When creating new instances of the Apigee X and hybrid plugin, you must now provide a source project ID. This source project ID is the Google Cloud project from which the plugin will import data.
This is a breaking change and will affect any existing API calls that create these plugins without explicitly providing this ID.
Action Required: Update your API calls to include the appropriate source project ID when creating new Apigee X and hybrid plugins. Failing to do so will result in creation errors.
Change
Edit plugin instances changes
You can now change or modify the name and curation logic of your plugin instance.
For more information, see Edit a plugin instance .
Change
Resource URI format for Apigee deployments
To ensure optimal functionality and consistency while creating or updating Apigee deployments, we now recommend that the Resource URI conforms to the following format:
