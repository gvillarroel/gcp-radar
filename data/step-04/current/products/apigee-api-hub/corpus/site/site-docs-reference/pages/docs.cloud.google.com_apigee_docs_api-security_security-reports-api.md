Manage security reports using the API
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
This page describes how to create and view
security reports using the security
reports API.
For an overview of security reports, including limitations, see
Security reports overview . For the API reference documentation for security reports, see the
Security reports API reference .
Note: Data flowing into the Apigee Analytics pipeline has a delay of up to 15 to 20 minutes on average.
As a result, a security report in which the end time is less than 20 minutes in the past
might return incorrect results.
Parameters in example API calls
The following sections give examples of API calls that use the security reports
API. The API calls contain the following parameters:
ORG is your organization.
ENV is the environment in which you want the report to be calculated.
ENVGROUP is an environment group containing the environment.
REPORT_ID is the report ID returned by a call to
create a security report .
$TOKEN is the environment variable for an
OAuth access token .
timeRange is the time range for the report.
Create a security report
To create a security report, enter a command like the following:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /environments/ ENV /securityReports" \
-X POST -d @./Query.json \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' -i \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
where Query.json is a query template that defines the query.
An example of a query template is shown below.
{
"dimensions": [
"ax_resolved_client_ip",
],
"metrics": [
{
"aggregation_function": "count_distinct",
"name": "bot"
},
{
"aggregation_function": "sum",
"name": "bot_traffic"
},
],
"groupByTimeUnit": "minute",
"timeRange": "last7days"
}
The query has the following parameters:
Metrics:
bot . This counts the number of distinct IP addresses that have been
identified as sources of bots.
Aggregation function: count_distinct
bot_traffic . The total number of requests from IP addresses that are the
sources of bots.
Aggregation function: sum
See Metrics and aggregation functions .
Dimension: ax_resolved_client_ip . This groups the counts of bots in the report by the
IP address of their source. See
Dimensions for
information of supported dimensions.
Filter: environment .
groupByTimeUnit: minute
timeRange: last7days . See Time range .
Note that this API call returns the same report as the
bot IP addresses report example created using the Apigee UI.
Time range
The time range for the report. You can set the timeRange field in either of the
following ways:
Specify how long in the past the report should extend. Options are:
"timeRange": "{last60minutes/last24hours/last7days}"
Specify a start and end time for the report in the following format:
"timeRange": {
"start": "YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z",
"end": "YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z"
}
Both start and end must be in the past, and can be at most 1 year
before the present when you create the report.
Sample response
The above query returns a response like the following:
{
"self": "/organizations/ ORG /environments/ ENV /securityReports/3964675e-9934-4398-bff5-39dd93a67201",
"state": "enqueued",
"created": "2021-08-06T22:28:28Z"
}
The response contains the following:
The report ID, which you can use to get the report once it is completed.
In the example above, the report ID is 3964675e-9934-4398-bff5-39dd93a67201 .
"state" : The state of the report job, which can be one of the following:
enqueued : The report job has just been created but is not running yet.
running : The report job is running.
completed : The report job is completed. At this stage, you can view the report.
expired : The report job has expired, and you can no longer view the report.
Get the report status
To get the status of a report, send a request like the following:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /environments/ ENV /securityReports/ REPORT_ID " \
-X GET -H 'Content-type: application/json' -i \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
where REPORT_ID is the report ID. See
Parameters in example API calls .
The response contains a summary of the report parameters, as well as the current status
of the report. In this example, the status is "completed" , so you can view the
report's results.
{
"self": "/organizations/sense-staging-test/environments/local/securityReports/bd2f4fe0-a906-44c2-8dcb-2c618e4b565d",
"state": "completed",
"created": "2022-06-27T13:00:25-07:00",
"updated": "2022-06-27T13:01:08-07:00",
"result": {
"self": "/organizations/sense-staging-test/environments/local/securityReports/bd2f4fe0-a906-44c2-8dcb-2c618e4b565d/result",
"expires": "2022-07-04T13:01:08-07:00"
},
"resultRows": "848",
"resultFileSize": "5.10 KB",
"executionTime": "43 seconds",
"queryParams": {
"metrics": [
"name:bot,func:count_distinct,alias:count_distinct_bot,op:,val:",
"name:bot_traffic,func:sum,alias:sum_bot_traffic,op:,val:"
],
"dimensions": [
"ax_resolved_client_ip"
],
"startTimestamp": "2022-06-20T20:00:25.098237292Z",
"endTimestamp": "2022-06-27T20:00:25.098237292Z",
"mimeType": "json",
"timeUnit": "minute"
},
"displayName": "Sample Query Bot"
}
Get the report
To download the security report, send a request like the following:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /environments/ ENV /securityReports/ REPORT_ID /result" \
-X GET -O -J \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
where REPORT_ID is the report ID. See
Parameters in example API calls .
This returns a file containing the report, whose name is of the form
OfflineQueryResult-{ID}.zip . To view the report:
Unzip OfflineQueryResult-{ID}.zip .
Enter gzip -d QueryResults-{ID}*.json.gz .
Enter cat QueryResults-{ID}*.json
.
Bot traffic example
The following example creates a report on bot_traffic :
{
"dimensions": [
"bot_reason"
],
"metrics": [
{
"aggregation_function": "sum",
"name": "bot_traffic"
}
],
"groupByTimeUnit": "minute",
"timeRange": "last7days"
}
The query has the following parameters:
Metric: bot_traffic . This is the total number of requests from IP addresses that
have been identified as bot sources, in one-minute intervals.
See Metrics and aggregation functions .
Dimension: bot_reason . bot_reason can be any combination of the
detection rules for bots.
When a bot is detected, bot_reason consists of the
subset of the detection rules that the bot's traffic pattern matched.
See Dimensions .
Filter: environment .
groupByTimeUnit: minute
timeRange: last7days
Note that this API call returns the same report as the
bot IP addresses report example created using the Apigee UI.
Bot detection data delay
Bot detection has a processing delay of around 15 to 20 minutes on average.
Create a security report for an environment group
Using the security reports API, you can create a report for data in an environment group
(as opposed to just an environment). To do so, enter a command like the following:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /hostSecurityReports" \
-X POST -d @./Query.json \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' -i \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
and make sure the query template, Query.json , contains the following line:
"envgroup_hostname": " ENVGROUP "
where ENVGROUP is the name of an environment group that contains the environment.
You can find the name of the environment group in the Apigee UI by going to
Admin > Environments > Groups .
Notes:
Environment group level Report APIs only support the metric
message_count with the aggregation function sum .
Environment group level Report APIs do not support the dimensions bot_reason
or incident_id , but do support all other
dimensions for security reports.
Get the report status
To get the status of a report, enter a command like the following:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ ORG /environments/ ENV /securityReports/ REPORT_ID " \
-X GET -H 'Content-type: application/json' -i \
-H 'Content-type: application/json' -i \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
This returns a summary of the report request, and the current state of the report.
Here's a sample response:
{
"self": "/organizations/ngsaas-runtime-staging/environments/test/securityReports/3964675e-9934-4398-bff5-39dd93a67201",
"state": "completed",
"created": "2021-08-06T15:28:28-07:00",
"updated": "2021-08-06T15:28:40-07:00",
"result": {
"self": "/organizations/ngsaas-runtime-staging/environments/test/securityReports/3964675e-9934-4398-bff5-39dd93a67201/result",
"expires": "2021-08-13T15:28:40-07:00"
},
"resultRows": "60",
"resultFileSize": "0.31 KB",
"executionTime": "11 seconds",
"queryParams": {
"metrics": [
"name:message_count,func:sum,alias:sum_message_count,op:,val:"
],
"dimensions": [
"apiproxy"
],
"startTimestamp": "2021-08-06T21:28:28.570770570Z",
"endTimestamp": "2021-08-06T22:28:28.570770570Z",
"mimeType": "json",
"timeUnit": "minute"
}
}
Since the state is "completed" , you can now view the report, as described next.
