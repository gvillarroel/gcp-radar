Security reports overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
Security reports are reports that identify security threats to your APIs. To generate reports,
Apigee scans API traffic data over a specified time interval and searches for unusual
traffic patterns that could be caused by malicious agents. The resulting report shows
suspicious activity. You can use this information to block attacks against your APIs.
You can create security reports either in
Apigee in Cloud console or
using the security reports API .
If you use the UI, the data for reports is restricted to the environment you choose. However,
using the API, you can also create reports for environment groups.
See
Required roles for security reports for the roles needed to perform security reports tasks.
To use this feature,
you must enable the add-on. If you are a Subscription customer, you can enable the
add-on for your organization. See
Manage Advanced API Security for Subscription organizations for more details. If
you are a Pay-as-you-go customer, you can enable the add-on in your eligible environments. For more information, see
Manage the Advanced API Security add-on .
Note: If you add an environment after enabling
Advanced API Security, you will need to re-enable it, by running the command shown in
Enable Advanced
API Security again, to view security reports for the new environment.
Bot detection
One of the most serious threats to API security comes from
bots : automated
scripts that send malicious requests to APIs. Advanced API Security searches for
specific API traffic patterns, called
detection rules ,
which are based on analysis of real API data, to detect bots.
Security reports data delay
Data flowing into the Apigee Analytics pipeline has a delay of up to 15 to 20 minutes on average.
As a result, a security report in which the end time is less than 20 minutes in the past
might return incorrect results.
Metrics and aggregation functions in security reports
You can use the following metrics and aggregation functions, which compute
statistics from a metric, for a report.
Metric
Description
Aggregation function
bot
The number of distinct IP addresses for detected bots over one-minute intervals.
count_distinct
bot_traffic
The number of messages from IP addresses of detected bots over one-minute intervals.
sum
message_count
Total number of API calls processed by Apigee in one-minute intervals.
Note: message_count cannot be used with other metrics in the same
report.
sum
response_size
Size of the response payload returned in bytes.
sum , avg , min , max
bot_first_detected
Date and time the bot was first detected. Only available through the API.
min
bot_last_detected
Date and time the bot was last detected. Only available through the API.
max
Dimensions in security reports
Dimensions let you group metric values together based on related
subsets of the data. The following table describes the dimensions that are specific to
Advanced API Security:
Dimension
Description
bot_reason
Can be any combination of the security
detection rules .
bot_reason consists of the
subset of the detection rules that the bot's traffic pattern matched.
bot_reason only works with the following metrics:
bot
bot_traffic
response_size
incident_id (preview)
The UUID for a security incident, which is returned by a call to the Incidents API.
See
Example: Get details for a specific incident .
incident_id only works with the following metrics:
bot
bot_traffic
response_size
security_action
The security action. Possibly values are ALLOW , DENY , or
FLAG .
security_action_name
The name of the security action.
security_action_headers
Headers that you can use to query for a flag security action.
In addition to these Advanced API Security-specific dimensions, Advanced API Security
also supports additional dimensions, which are described in
dimensions .

Limitations on security reports
Security reports have the following limitations:
Data flowing into the Apigee Analytics pipeline has a delay of up to 15 to 20 minutes
on average. As a result, creating a report in which the End Time is less
than 20 mins in the past might return incorrect results.
Maximum time range for bot reports is 1 year.
The maximum number of metrics you can use in a report is 25, and the maximum number of
dimensions you can use is 25.
As with the
asynchronous custom reports
API , there is a limit of 31 MB of data for a report. If you
encounter a size limit on a report, you can either:
Reduce the time range of the report.
Split the data into smaller subsets by filtering on a set of values,
and then create multiple reports, one for each subset.
The Resolved Client IP dimension can't be listed in the same report
with either the ax_geo_city or ax_geo_country dimension,
due to privacy concerns.
Security report jobs that filter on the incident_id must include the
incident_id as a dimension.
The following metrics are only available via the
security reports API , but not in
the UI: bot_first_detected (min) and bot_last_detected (max) .
