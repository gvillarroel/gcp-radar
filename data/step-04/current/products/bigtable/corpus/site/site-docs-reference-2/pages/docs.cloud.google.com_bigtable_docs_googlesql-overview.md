GoogleSQL for Bigtable
overview
You can use GoogleSQL statements to query your
Bigtable data. GoogleSQL is an ANSI-compliant
structured query language (SQL) that is also implemented for other Google Cloud
services such as BigQuery and Spanner.
This document provides an overview of GoogleSQL for
Bigtable. It provides examples of SQL queries that you can use
with Bigtable and describes how they relate to a
Bigtable table schema. Before you read this document, you should
be familiar with the Bigtable storage
model
and schema design
concepts .
You can create and run queries in Bigtable
Studio in the Google Cloud console,
or you can run them programmatically using the Bigtable client
library for
Java ,
Python , or Go .
For more information, see Use SQL with a Bigtable client library .
SQL queries are handled by cluster nodes in the same way as NoSQL data requests.
Therefore, the same best practices apply when creating SQL queries to run
against your Bigtable data, such as avoiding full table scans or
complex filters. For more information, see Reads and
performance .
You can't use Data Boost with
GoogleSQL for Bigtable.
Use cases
GoogleSQL for Bigtable is optimal for low-latency
application development. Additionally, running SQL queries in the
Google Cloud console can be useful for quickly getting a visual representation
of a table's schema, verifying that certain data was written, or debugging
possible data issues.
The current release of GoogleSQL for Bigtable
doesn't support some common SQL constructs, including, but not limited to, the
following:
Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements beyond SELECT , such as
INSERT , UPDATE , or DELETE
Data Definition Language (DDL) statements such as CREATE , ALTER , or
DROP
Data Access Control statements
Query syntax for subqueries, JOIN , UNION , and CTEs
For more information, including supported functions, operators, data types, and
query syntax, see the GoogleSQL for Bigtable
reference
documentation .
Views
You can use GoogleSQL for Bigtable to create the
following resources:
Continuous materialized view - a
pre-computed result of a continuously running SQL query, including
aggregated data, that synchronizes with its source table with incremental
updates. This feature is in Preview .
Logical view - a saved, named
query that can be queried like a table.
To compare these types of views as well as authorized views, see Tables and
views .
Key concepts
This section discusses key concepts to be aware of when you use
GoogleSQL to query your Bigtable data.
Column families in SQL responses
In Bigtable, a table contains one or more column families, which
are used to group columns. When you query a Bigtable table with
GoogleSQL, the schema for the table consists of the following:
A special column named _key that corresponds to row keys in the queried
table
A single column for each Bigtable column family in the table,
which contains the column family's data in that row
Map data type
GoogleSQL for Bigtable includes the data type
MAP<key, value> ,
which is designed specifically to accommodate column families.
By default, each row in a map column contains key-value pairs, where a key is
the Bigtable column qualifier in the queried table, and the value
is the most recent value for that column.
The following is an example of a SQL query returns a table with the
row key value and the latest value of the qualifier from a map named
columnFamily .
SELECT _key , columnFamily [ 'qualifier' ] FROM myTable
If your Bigtable schema involves storing multiple cells – or
versions of the data – in columns, you can add a temporal
filter , such as with_history , to your SQL statement.
In this case, maps representing column families are nested and returned as an
array. In the array, each value is itself a map consisting of a timestamp as the
key and cell data as the value. The format is
MAP<key, ARRAY<STRUCT<timestamp, value>>> .
The following example returns all cells in the 'info' column family for a single
row.
SELECT _key , info FROM users ( with_history = > TRUE ) WHERE _key = 'user_123' ;
The returned map looks like the following. In the queried table, info is the
column family, user_123 is the row key and city and state are the column
qualifiers. Each timestamp-value pair ( STRUCT ) in an array represents cells in
those columns in that row, and they are sorted by timestamp descending.
/*----------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| _key | info |
+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| user_123 | {"city":{<t5>:"Brooklyn", <t0>:"New York"}, "state":{<t0>:"NY"}} |
+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------*/
Sparse tables
A key feature of Bigtable is its flexible data model. In a
Bigtable table, if a column is unused in a row, no data is stored
for the column. A row might have one column and the next row might have 100
columns. In contrast, in a relational database table, all rows contain all
columns, and a NULL value is typically stored in the column of a row that has no
data for that column.
When you query a Bigtable table with GoogleSQL,
however, an unused column is represented with an empty map and is returned as a
NULL value. These NULL values can be used as query predicates. For example, a
predicate like WHERE family['column1'] IS NOT NULL can be used to return a row
only if column1 is used in the row.
Bytes
When you provide a string, GoogleSQL by default implicitly casts
from STRING values to BYTES values. This means, for example, that you can
provide the string 'qualifier' rather than the bytes sequence b'qualifier' .
Because Bigtable by default treats all data as bytes, most
Bigtable columns don't contain type information. However, with
GoogleSQL you can define a schema at read time with the CAST
function. For more information about casting, see Conversion
functions .
Temporal filters
The following table lists the arguments that you can use when accessing
temporal elements of a table. Arguments are listed in the order in which they
are filtered. For example, with_history is applied before latest_n . You must
provide a valid timestamp.
Argument
Description
as_of
Timestamp . Returns the latest values with timestamps less
than or equal to the provided timestamp.
with_history
Boolean . Controls whether to return the latest value as a
scalar or timestamped values(s) as STRUCT .
after
Timestamp . Values with timestamps after the input, exclusive.
Requires with_history => TRUE .
after_or_equal
Timestamp . Values with timestamps after the input,
inclusive. Requires with_history => TRUE .
before
Timestamp . Values with timestamps before the input,
exclusive. Requires with_history => TRUE .
latest_n
Integer . The number of timestamped values to return per column
qualifier (map key). Must be greater than or equal to 1. Requires
with_history => TRUE .
For more examples, see Advanced query
patterns .
Foundational queries
This section describes and shows examples of basic Bigtable SQL
queries and how they work. For additional sample queries, see
GoogleSQL for Bigtable query pattern
examples .
Retrieve the latest version
Although Bigtable lets you store multiple versions of data in
each column, GoogleSQL for Bigtable by default
returns the latest version – the most recent cell – of the data for each row.
Consider the following sample dataset, which shows that user1 relocated twice
in the state of NY and once within the city of Brooklyn. In this example,
address is the column family, and the column qualifiers are street , city ,
and state . Cells in a column are separated by empty lines.
address
_key
street
city
state
user1
2023/01/10-14:10:01.000:
'113 Xyz Street'
2021/12/20-09:44:31.010:
'76 Xyz Street'
2005/03/01-11:12:15.112:
'123 Abc Street'
2021/12/20-09:44:31.010:
'Brooklyn'
2005/03/01-11:12:15.112:
'Queens'
2005/03/01-11:12:15.112:
'NY'
To retrieve the latest version of each column for user1 , you can use a
SELECT statement like the following.
SELECT address [ 'street' ] , address [ 'city' ] FROM myTable WHERE _key = 'user1'
The response contains the current address, which is a combination of the most
recent street, city and state values (written at different times) printed as
JSON. Timestamps are not included in the response.
_key
address
user1
{street:'113 Xyz Street', city:'Brooklyn', state: :'NY'}
Retrieve all versions
To retrieve earlier versions (cells) of the data, use the with_history flag. You
can also alias columns and expressions, as illustrated in the following example.
SELECT _key , columnFamily [ 'qualifier' ] AS col1
FROM myTable ( with_history = > TRUE )
To better understand the events leading to the current state of a row, you can
retrieve the timestamps for each value by retrieving the full history. For
example, to understand when user1 moved to their current address and where
they moved from, you could run the following query:
SELECT
address [ 'street' ][ 0 ] . value AS moved_to ,
address [ 'street' ][ 1 ] . value AS moved_from ,
FORMAT_TIMESTAMP ( '%Y-%m-%d' , address [ 'street' ][ 0 ] . timestamp ) AS moved_on ,
FROM myTable ( with_history = > TRUE )
WHERE _key = 'user1'
When you use the with_history flag in your SQL query, the response is
returned as MAP<key, ARRAY<STRUCT<timestamp, value>>> . Each item in the array
is a timestamped value for the specified row, column family, and column.
Timestamps are ordered in reverse chronological order, so the latest data is
always the first item returned.
Note: Garbage collection policies control the expiration time or number of
versions retained for a column family. For more information, see the
Garbage collection overview .
The query response is as follows.
moved_to
moved_from
moved_on
113 Xyz Street
76 Xyz Street
2023/01/10
You can also retrieve the number of versions in each row using array functions
as demonstrated in the following query:
SELECT _key , ARRAY_LENGTH ( MAP_ENTRIES ( address )) AS version_count
FROM myTable ( with_history = > TRUE )
Retrieve data from a specified time
Using an as_of filter lets you retrieve the state of a row as it was at a
certain point in time. For example, if you want to know the address of user as
of January 10, 2022 1:14 PM, you can run the following query.
SELECT address
FROM myTable ( as_of = > TIMESTAMP ( '2022-01-10T13:14:00.234Z' ))
WHERE _key = 'user1'
The result shows what would have been the last known address on January 10,
2022 1:14 PM, which is the combination of street and city from the
2021/12/20-09:44:31.010 update and the state from 2005/03/01-11:12:15.112.
address
{street:'76 Xyz Street', city:'Brooklyn', state: :'NY'}
The same result can also be achieved using Unix timestamps.
SELECT address
FROM myTable ( as_of = > TIMESTAMP_FROM_UNIX_MILLIS ( 1641820440000 ))
WHERE _key = 'user1'
Consider the following dataset, which shows the on-or-off state of smoke and
carbon monoxide alarms. The column family is alarmType and the column
qualifiers are smoke and carbonMonoxide . Cells in each column are separated
by empty lines.
alarmType
_key
smoke
carbonMonoxide
building1#section1
2023/04/01-09:10:15.000:
'off'
2023/04/01-08:41:40.000:
'on'
2020/07/03-06:25:31.000:
'off'
2020/07/03-06:02:04.000:
'on'
2023/04/01-09:22:08.000:
'off'
2023/04/01-08:53:12.000:
'on'
building1#section2
2021/03/11-07:15:04.000:
'off'
2021/03/11-07:00:25.000:
'on'
You can find sections of building1 where a smoke alarm was on at 9 AM on April
1, 2023 and the status of the carbon monoxide alarm at the time using the
following query.
SELECT _key AS location , alarmType [ 'carbonMonoxide' ] AS CO_sensor
FROM alarms ( as_of = > TIMESTAMP ( '2023-04-01T09:00:00.000Z' ))
WHERE _key LIKE 'building1%' and alarmType [ 'smoke' ] = 'on'
The result is the following:
location
CO_sensor
building1#section1
'on'
Query time series data
A common use case for Bigtable is the storage of
time series data .
Consider the following sample dataset, which shows temperature and humidity
readings for weather sensors. The column family ID is metrics and the column
qualifiers are temperature and humidity . Cells in a column are separated by
empty lines, and each cell represents a timestamped sensor reading.
metrics
_key
temperature
humidity
sensorA#20230105
2023/01/05-02:00:00.000:
54
2023/01/05-01:00:00.000:
56
2023/01/05-00:00:00.000:
55
2023/01/05-02:00:00.000:
0.89
2023/01/05-01:00:00.000:
0.9
2023/01/05-00:00:00.000:
0.91
sensorA#20230104
2023/01/04-23:00:00.000:
56
2023/01/04-22:00:00.000:
57
2023/01/04-23:00:00.000:
0.9
2023/01/04-22:00:00.000:
0.91
You can retrieve a specific range of timestamp values using the temporal filters
after , before , or after_or_equal . The following example uses after :
SELECT metrics [ 'temperature' ] AS temp_versioned
FROM
sensorReadings ( with_history = > true , after = > TIMESTAMP ( '2023-01-04T23:00:00.000Z' ),
before = > TIMESTAMP ( '2023-01-05T01:00:00.000Z' ))
WHERE _key LIKE 'sensorA%'
The query returns the data in this format:
temp_versioned
[{timestamp: '2023/01/05-01:00:00.000', value:56}
{timestamp: '2023/01/05-00:00:00.000', value: 55}]
[{timestamp: '2023/01/04-23:00:00.000', value:56}]
UNPACK time series data
When you're analyzing time series data, it's often preferable to work with the
data in a tabular format. The Bigtable UNPACK function can help.
UNPACK is a Bigtable table value function (TVF) that returns an
entire output table instead of a single scalar value, and appears in the FROM
clause like a table subquery. The UNPACK TVF expands each timestamped value
into multiple rows – one per timestamp – and moves the timestamp into the
_timestamp column.
The input to UNPACK is a subquery where with_history => true .
The output is an expanded table with a _timestamp column in each row.
An input column family MAP<key, ARRAY<STRUCT<timestamp, value>>> unpacks to
MAP<key, value> , and a column qualifier ARRAY<STRUCT<timestamp, value>>>
unpacks to value . Other input column types are unchanged. The columns must be
selected in the subquery in order to be unpacked and selected. The new
_timestamp column doesn't need to be selected in order for the timestamps to
be unpacked.
Expanding on the time series example in
Query time series data ,
and using the query in that section as the input, your UNPACK query is
formatted like this:
SELECT temp_versioned , _timestamp
FROM
UNPACK ((
SELECT metrics [ 'temperature' ] AS temperature_versioned
FROM
sensorReadings ( with_history = > true , after = > TIMESTAMP ( '2023-01-04T23:00:00.000Z' ),
before = > TIMESTAMP ( '2023-01-05T01:00:00.000Z' ))
WHERE _key LIKE 'sensorA%'
));
The query returns the data in this format:
temp_versioned
_timestamp
55
1672898400
55
1672894800
56
1672891200
Query JSON
JSON functions let you manipulate JSON stored as Bigtable values
for operational workloads.
For example, you can retrieve the value for the JSON element abc from the
latest cell in the session column family along with the row key by using the
following query.
SELECT _key , JSON_VALUE ( session [ 'payload' ] , '$.abc' ) AS abc FROM analytics
Escape special characters and reserved words
Bigtable offers high flexibility in naming tables and columns.
As a result, in your SQL queries, your table names might need to be escaped due
to special characters or reserved words.
For example the following query is not valid SQL due to the period in the table
name.
-- ERROR: Table name format not supported
SELECT * FROM my . table WHERE _key = 'r1'
However, you can resolve this issue by enclosing the items with backtick
(`) characters.
SELECT * FROM `my.table` WHERE _key = 'r1'
If a SQL reserved keyword is used as an identifier, it can similarly be
escaped.
SELECT * FROM `select` WHERE _key = 'r1'
Use SQL with a Bigtable client library
The Bigtable client libraries for Java, Python, and Go support
querying data with SQL using the executeQuery API. The following examples show
how to issue a query and access the data:
Go
To use this feature you must use cloud.google.com/go/bigtable version 1.36.0
or later. For more information on usage see PrepareStatement ,
Bind ,
Execute ,
and ResultRow
documentation.
import (
"cloud.google.com/go/bigtable"
)
func query ( client * bigtable . Client ) {
// Prepare once for queries that will be run multiple times, and reuse
// the PreparedStatement for each request. Use query parameters to
// construct PreparedStatements that can be reused.
ps , err := client . PrepareStatement (
"SELECT cf1['bytesCol'] AS bytesCol, CAST(cf2['stringCol'] AS STRING) AS stringCol, cf3 FROM myTable WHERE _key=@keyParam" ,
map [ string ] SQLType {
"keyParam" : BytesSQLType {},
}
)
if err != nil {
log . Fatalf ( "Failed to create PreparedStatement: %v" , err )
}
// For each request, create a BoundStatement with your query parameters set.
bs , err := ps . Bind ( map [ string ] any {
"keyParam" : [] byte ( "mykey" )
})
if err != nil {
log . Fatalf ( "Failed to bind parameters: %v" , err )
}
err = bs . Execute ( ctx , func ( rr ResultRow ) bool {
var byteValue [] byte
err := rr . GetByName ( "bytesCol" , & byteValue )
if err != nil {
log . Fatalf ( "Failed to access bytesCol: %v" , err )
}
var stringValue string
err = rr . GetByName ( "stringCol" , & stringValue )
if err != nil {
log . Fatalf ( "Failed to access stringCol: %v" , err )
}
// Note that column family maps have byte valued keys. Go maps don't support
// byte[] keys, so the map will have Base64 encoded string keys.
var cf3 map [ string ][] byte
err = rr . GetByName ( "cf3" , & cf3 )
if err != nil {
log . Fatalf ( "Failed to access cf3: %v" , err )
}
// Do something with the data
// ...
return true
})
}
Java
To use this feature you must use java-bigtable version 2.57.3 or later. For
more information on usage, see
prepareStatement ,
executeQuery ,
BoundStatement ,
and
ResultSet
in the Javadoc.
static void query ( BigtableDataClient client ) {
// Prepare once for queries that will be run multiple times, and reuse
// the PreparedStatement for each request. Use query parameters to
// construct PreparedStatements that can be reused.
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = client . prepareStatement (
"SELECT cf1['bytesCol'] AS bytesCol, CAST(cf2['stringCol'] AS STRING) AS stringCol, cf3 FROM myTable WHERE _key=@keyParam" ,
// For queries with parameters, set the parameter names and types here.
Map . of ( "keyParam" , SqlType . bytes ())
);
// For each request, create a BoundStatement with your query parameters set.
BoundStatement boundStatement = preparedStatement . bind ()
. setBytesParam ( "keyParam" , ByteString . copyFromUtf8 ( "mykey" ))
. build ();
try ( ResultSet resultSet = client . executeQuery ( boundStatement )) {
while ( resultSet . next ()) {
ByteString byteValue = resultSet . getBytes ( "bytesCol" );
String stringValue = resultSet . getString ( "stringCol" );
Map<ByteString , ByteString > cf3Value =
resultSet . getMap ( "cf3" , SqlType . mapOf ( SqlType . bytes (), SqlType . bytes ()));
// Do something with the data.
}
}
}
Python asyncio
To use this feature, you must use python-bigtable version 2.30.1 or later.
from google.cloud.bigtable.data import BigtableDataClientAsync
async def execute_query ( project_id , instance_id , table_id ):
async with BigtableDataClientAsync ( project = project_id ) as client :
query = (
"SELECT cf1['bytesCol'] AS bytesCol, CAST(cf2['stringCol'] AS STRING) AS stringCol,"
" cf3 FROM {table_id} WHERE _key='mykey'"
)
async for row in await client . execute_query ( query , instance_id ):
print ( row [ "_key" ], row [ "bytesCol" ], row [ "stringCol" ], row [ "cf3" ])
SELECT * usage
SELECT * queries can experience temporary errors when a column family is added
or deleted from the queried table. For this reason, for production workloads, we
recommend that you specify all column family IDs in your query, rather than
using SELECT * . For example, use SELECT cf1, cf2, cf3 instead of SELECT * .
