Garbage collection overview
This page describes how garbage collection works in Bigtable and covers
the following topics:
Types of garbage collection
Default garbage collection settings
When data is deleted
Changes to garbage collection policies for replicated tables
Overview of garbage collection
Garbage collection is the automatic, ongoing process of removing expired
and obsolete data from Bigtable tables. A garbage collection
policy is a set of rules you create that state when data in a specific
column family is no longer needed.
Garbage collection is a built-in, asynchronous background process that takes
place during compaction . Garbage collection occurs on a fixed
schedule that does not vary based on how much data needs to be deleted. Until
the data is deleted, it appears in read results. You can filter your reads to
exclude this data.
Key Point: You don't need to filter values from reads if the values have been
deleted by you or your application. When you delete a value, it immediately
stops appearing in read results. On the other hand, if you want to exclude
values that are marked for deletion as part of garbage collection,
always apply a filter to your read requests that excludes the
same values as your garbage collection rules.
For more information, see the When data is deleted section of
this document.
The benefits of garbage collection policies include the following:
Minimize row size - You always want to prevent rows from growing
indefinitely. Large rows negatively affect performance. Ideally, you should
never let a row grow beyond 100 MB in size, and the
limit is 256 MB. If you don't need to keep historical data,
or earlier versions of your current data, using garbage collection can help you
minimize the size of each row.
Keep costs down - Garbage collection ensures that you don't pay to store
data that is no longer required or used. You are charged for storage of expired
or obsolete data until compaction occurs and data eligible for
garbage collection is deleted. This process typically takes a few days but might
take up to a week.
You can set garbage collection policies either programmatically or with the
cbt CLI
. Garbage collection policies are set at the column
family level.
Each column family in a table has its own garbage collection policy. The garbage
collection process looks up the current garbage collection policy for each
column family, then deletes data according to the rules in the policy.
Timestamps
In Bigtable, the intersection of a row and a column can have
multiple cells, which contain timestamped versions of the value for that intersection.
Each cell has a timestamp. A timestamp is the number of microseconds since the
Unix epoch , 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC . You can
use default timestamps or set them when you send write requests .
A timestamp that you send to Bigtable must be a microsecond value with at most
millisecond precision. A timestamp with microsecond precision, such as
3023483279876543 , is rejected. In this example, the acceptable timestamp value is
3023483279876000 .
The timestamp property of a cell can be a "real" timestamp, reflecting the
actual time the value for the cell is written, or it can be an "artificial"
timestamp. Artificial timestamps include sequential numbers, zeroes, or
timestamp-formatted values that are not the actual time the cell was written.
Before you use artificial timestamps, review the use cases for artificial
timestamps, including the risks of using them:
Simulating cell-level TTL
Storing sequential numbers in timestamps
Make sure that you set a default timestamp when sending write requests
unless you need to support a use case with artificial timestamps.
Caution: Using artificial timestamps, including zeroes, prevents you from being
able to use cells' timestamps for
time-series data . It can take up to
a week for garbage collection to remove cells with artificial timestamps.
Types of garbage collection
This section describes the types of garbage collection available in
Bigtable. Code samples for each type of garbage collection are at
Configuring garbage collection .
Expiring values (age-based)
You can set a garbage collection rule based on the timestamp for each cell. For
example, you might not want to keep any cells with timestamps more than 30 days
before the current date and time. With this type of garbage collection rule, you
set the time to live (TTL) for data. Bigtable looks at each column
family during garbage collection and deletes any cells that have expired.
Number of versions
You can set a garbage collection rule that explicitly states the maximum number
of cells to keep for all columns in a column family.
For example, if you want to keep only the latest username and email address for
a customer, you can create a column family containing those two columns and set
the maximum number of values to 1 for that column family.
In another case, you might want to keep the last five versions of a user's
password hash to make sure they don't reuse the password, so you would set the
maximum number of versions for the column family containing the password column
to 5 . When Bigtable looks at the column family during garbage
collection, if a sixth cell has been written to the password column, the oldest
cell is deleted to keep the number of cells to five.
Combinations of expiration and version number rules
You can use a combination of expiration and version number rules for garbage
collection. The types of combinations are intersection , union , and
nested . For configuration examples, see Garbage collection based on
multiple criteria .
Intersection
An intersection garbage collection policy marks data for deletion when it
meets all the criteria in a given set of rules. For example, you might want
to delete profiles older than 30 days but always keep at least one for each
user. In this case, your intersection policy for the column family containing
the profile column would consist of a rule for an expiring value and a rule
for the number of versions.
Union
A union garbage collection policy marks data for deletion when it meets
any item in a given set of rules. For example, you might want to make sure
that you retain a maximum of two page-view records per user but only if they are
less than 30 days old. In this case, your union policy is set for an expiring
value or a number of versions.
Nested
A nested garbage collection policy has a combination of union and
intersection rules.
Default settings for garbage collection
There is no default TTL for a column family. The number of cells retained for
a column depends on how you create the column family that the column is in, as
explained in the following sections.
HBase policy
If you create the column family with the HBase client for Java, the HBase
shell, or another tool that uses the HBase client for Java,
Bigtable retains only the most recent cell in each column in
the column family, unless you change the rule. This default setting is
consistent with HBase.
All other client libraries or tools
If you create the column family with any other client library or tool,
Bigtable retains an infinite number of cells in each column in
the column family. This includes column families created with gcloud and the
cbt CLI
. You must change the garbage collection policy for the column
family if you want to limit the number of versions.
When data is deleted
Garbage collection is a continuous process in which Bigtable
checks the rules for each column family and deletes expired and obsolete data
accordingly. In general, it can take up to a week from the time that data
matches the criteria in the rules for the data to actually be deleted. You are
not able to change the timing of garbage collection.
Note: Garbage collection and deletes written to the table by your application
are both executed during compaction, but they work differently and independently
of each other. A key difference is that if your application deletes a piece of
data, a read request for that data immediately afterward returns an empty
response. On the other hand, when a piece of data becomes eligible for garbage
collection, you can continue to read it until the next compaction occurs.
Because it can take up to a week for expired data to be deleted, you should
never rely solely on garbage collection policies to ensure that read requests
return the selected data. Always apply a filter to your read requests that
excludes the same values as your garbage collection rules. You can filter by
limiting the number of cells per column or by
specifying a timestamp range .
For example, assume that a column family's garbage collection rule is set to
keep only the five most recent versions of a profile, and five versions are
already stored. After a new version of the profile is written, it might take up
to a week for the oldest cell to be deleted. Therefore, to avoid reading the
sixth value, you should always filter out everything except the five most recent
versions.
You are charged for storage of expired data until compaction occurs and the
data is deleted.
Garbage collection is retroactive: when a new garbage collection policy is set,
over the next few days it is applied to all data in the table. If the new
policy is more restrictive than the previous policy, old data is deleted as
the background work happens, including data that was written before the policy
change.
If you want to make sure that data marked for garbage collection is being
deleted, you can query your table and compare the data with expected results.
You can also monitor table size in the Google Cloud console . A table that never gets
smaller might reflect a garbage collection policy that is not working as
expected, but remember that garbage collection is executed on a delay.
Replication and garbage collection
Replication can affect garbage collection in a few ways.
Version-based garbage collection and CPU usage
In an instance that uses replication, deletes from version-based garbage
collection are replicated to all clusters in the instance in
the same way that application requests are replicated. If you rapidly write
new cells that cause older cells to become marked for deletion, you might see
increased CPU utilization when Bigtable deletes the stale cells
and replicates those deletes to other clusters in the instance. Be prepared for
this increase in CPU usage if you add a cluster to an instance containing tables
that use version-based garbage collection.
Age-based garbage collection , on the other hand, does not increase
CPU usage in replicated instances.
Changing version-based garbage collection policies
You can modify a column family's maximum number of versions in a replicated
table. However, if you lower the number of versions for a column family, it
can take up to a week for all replicated clusters to reflect the new, lower
number. Therefore, you should always use filters when reading the data.
Changing age-based garbage collection policies
You can increase or decrease the retention time specified in garbage collection
policies regardless of whether the instance uses replication. If the instance
doesn't use replication, you can also delete an age-based garbage collection
policy.
Decreasing the retention time
If you decrease the retention time in an age-based policy, it can take up to a
week for all clusters to synchronize and use the new policy.
Increasing the retention time
In a replicated table, you can increase a garbage collection policy's retention
time by a maximum of 90 days.
If you increase the retention period for a column family, be aware that
your clusters might be out of sync for longer than a week. To see why, consider
a hypothetical case where you have a table in a two-cluster instance and you
change a column family's retention period from 30 days to 50 days:
A write request for row key ip#685 is sent to cluster A with a value of
2023-01-02 for column click-through in column family profile . The data is
replicated to cluster B.
Thirty-one days later, garbage collection occurs on cluster A, and the value
in the click-through column is recognized as expired and deleted.
You change the garbage collection policy for column family profile ,
increasing the TTL from 30 days to 50 days.
A day later, garbage collection runs on cluster B. Because the TTL is 50
days, the value 2023-01-02 is retained.
The clusters are now out of sync and remain so for almost 20 days
until the value that exists in cluster B but not cluster A is finally deleted.
