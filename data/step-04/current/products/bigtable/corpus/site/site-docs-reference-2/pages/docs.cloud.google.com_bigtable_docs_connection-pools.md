Connection pools
This topic describes how connection pools work in Bigtable, the impacts
that connection pool size can have on an application that uses
Bigtable, and when you might want to change the default connection
pool settings.
After you read this page, if you determine that you should change your
connection pool size, see Configuring connection pools to
learn how to determine the optimal size and how to change it. The number of
connections in each pool is configurable in your code only when you use the Go,
C++, or Java client libraries for Cloud Bigtable.
How connection pools work
A connection pool , also known as a channel pool , is a cache of database
connections that are shared and reused to improve connection latency and
performance. Connections are used in a round robin system.
When you use Bigtable, you create a single data client per
application process. Each client has one connection pool. Each connection pool
contains some number of gRPC connections, which can each handle up to 100
concurrent streams. Requests sent through these connections pass through Google
middleware, which then routes them to your table. The middleware layer is made
up of many load-balanced instances, and each request is routed through the
middleware instance that has the most availability.
You can think of a connection (or channel) like a highway that has up to 100
lanes, and each lane (stream) can only contain one car (request) at any given
time. The limit of 100 concurrent streams per gRPC connection is enforced in
Google's middleware layer, and you are not able to reconfigure this number.
A connection automatically refreshes itself once every hour. Additionally, if a
connection has not seen a request in five minutes, the middleware automatically
deletes the connection and doesn't recreate it until an additional connection is
needed.
Behind the scenes, each channel has a single subchannel. Each subchannel has an
HTTP2 connection that uses TCP to convert requests to bytes and send them
through the middleware and then to your table. This process is handled
seamlessly by the Bigtable service, and you don't need to configure
anything to make it happen.
How connection pools affect performance
Ideally, you should have enough gRPC connections to handle your requests
without any buffering. However, you should not have so many connections that
they are frequently dropped because of lack of use.
Not enough connections
If a connection pool does not have enough connections to handle your traffic,
the middleware starts to buffer and queue requests. This buffering slows down
the traffic, reducing the number of requests per second and increasing latency
as the requests back up.
Too many connections
If a pool has too many connections, meaning some of the connections are idle,
the middleware disconnects the idle connections. Then when new requests come
through that require them, these connections are reestablished. This means that
when traffic increases, requests can encounter a server-side cache miss, causing
extra work and latency. If this happens frequently because of varying traffic
levels, this activity can manifest as a perceived spike in tail latency on the
client side.
Note: In most cases, you cannot control the refresh cadence. However, If this
tail latency is a concern and you need predictable latency at a low rate of
queries per second (QPS), and you are using the
Cloud Bigtable client library for Java , you are able to
configure the refresh settings using the BigtableDataSettings.Builder class.
If you are using the Cloud Bigtable client library for Go ,
see the Connection Refresh Example on GitHub.
When to change the default settings
The default connection pool size is right for most applications, and in most
cases there's no need to change it. Depending on the client library you use in
your application, you might not be able to change your connection pool size. The
number of connections in each pool is configurable in your code only when you
use the Go, C++, or Java client libraries for Cloud Bigtable .
As a general rule, an ideal connection pool has at least twice the number of
connections that it takes for maximum saturation. This leaves room for traffic
fluctuations. For example, if you have 4 connections and they are each handling
the maximum number of requests possible (100), you want to bring the number of
requests per connection down to a number between 10 and 50, so the ideal
connection pool size is at least double that, or a minimum of 8 connections.
Signals that you should consider changing the number of connections in the pool
include the following:
Low throughput combined with spikes in client-side tail latency
If your typical throughput is fairly low, such as less than one request per
second per connection, and you observe periodically high tail latency for your
application, you might not be sending enough traffic to keep the connections
alive. In this case, you might need to lower the number of connections in the
pool. See Configuring connection pools to learn how to
determine the right number.
Buffered requests
If you observe that requests are stacking up on the client side, this might
indicate that you are sending more concurrent requests than the connection pool
can handle. Calculate the optimal number , then change
your code if you need to.
To determine whether requests are stacking up, you can use
OpenCensus to look at the difference between the
grpc.io/client/started_rpcs and grpc.io/client/completed_rpcs metrics.
Virtual environment
In some rare cases, the Bigtable client is not able to tell the
number of CPUs that the application is running on and allocates connections as
if only one CPU is in use. For example, this can happen when you use virtual
CPU instances in Kubernetes or Docker. If this is evident, you should configure
the number of pools according to the guidelines based on
your application's QPS and latency.
