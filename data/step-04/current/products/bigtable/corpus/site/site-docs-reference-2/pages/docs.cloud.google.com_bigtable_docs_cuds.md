Committed use discounts
This document describes spend-based committed use discounts (CUDs) for Bigtable.
Committed use discounts (CUDs) for Bigtable provide
discounted prices in exchange for your commitment to continuously spend a
minimum hourly amount on Bigtable capacity for a year or longer.
Bigtable spend-based CUDs are ideal when your spending on
Bigtable capacity involves a predictable minimum that you can
commit to for at least a year.
Important: This page explains the new and improved committed use discounts (CUDs) program,
which applies to any customers who purchase their first CUDs on or after
July 15, 2025 . For more information, see
Spend-based CUDs program improvements .
Bigtable CUD pricing
Bigtable offers two levels of discounts, depending on the
commitment period:
20% discount : You get this by committing to a 1-year term. For the duration of your term, you pay the Bigtable CUD 1-year price (consumption model ID A03A-2A56-8086) as your committed hourly spend amount.
40% discount : You get this by committing to a 3-year term. For the duration of your term, you pay the Bigtable CUD 3-year price (consumption model ID 4F61-4520-4936) as your committed hourly spend amount.
When you purchase a commitment, you agree to pay a fixed hourly fee for a one
or three-year term. Your monthly invoice shows usage charges using the
CUD consumption model
prices for usage that falls within your commitment. You're charged $1 for
$1 worth of commitment fees, and a corresponding credit applies so that the
commitment fee is offset for any utilized portion of your commitment.
For a full example, see
An example Bigtable CUD .
For any unused portion of your commitment, the fee applies. The result
is that you pay the flat commitment fee every hour, whether you use the
services or not, but commitment fees are then credited back to you for the
used portions within the commitment amount.
Any expenditure beyond the commitment gets billed at the on-demand rate.
As your usage grows, you can purchase additional commitments to receive
discounts on increased expenditures not covered by previous commitments.
The CUD discount applies to any eligible usage in projects
associated with the Cloud Billing account.
If the on-demand rates change after you purchase a commitment,
your commitment fee doesn't change.
The discount applies to all eligible node usage in Bigtable
projects associated with the Cloud Billing account used to purchase the
commitment, regardless of instance or region.
Eligible resources
Bigtable CUDs automatically apply to your spending on
Bigtable compute capacity as measured in nodes across projects.
Bigtable CUDs don't apply to your spending on
Bigtable storage, backup storage, or network data transfer.
For a list of applicable SKUs, see Bigtable CUD Eligible SKUs .
Purchasing a commitment
After your purchase a CUD, you can't cancel your commitment. Make sure the
size and duration of your commitment aligns with both your historical and your
expected minimum expenditure on Bigtable capacity. For more
information, see
Canceling commitments .
To purchase or manage Bigtable committed use discounts for your
Cloud Billing account, follow the instructions at
Purchasing spend-based
commitments .
An example Bigtable CUD scenario
Ideally, your commitment represents at least your expected minimum hourly
expenditure on Bigtable nodes across your projects
over the next one or three years.
As an example, say that you have a Bigtable instance that has
two clusters in different regions: us-central1 (Iowa) and us-west2 (Los
Angeles). The cluster in us-central1 has 10 nodes and the cluster in
us-west2 has 20 nodes.
From the pricing page , see the price in the column labeled Cost per node with 1-year committed use discounts to calculate the
approximate hourly commitment cost:
Expenditure in us-central1 : 10 nodes * $0.52 per node per hour =
$5.20 per hour
Expenditure in us-west2 : 20 nodes * $0.624 per node per hour = $12.48
per hour
Total expenditure across all regions: $6.50 + $15.60 = $17.68 per hour ($12,906.40 per month or $154,876.80 per year).
If you expect to spend that minimum of $17.68 per hour continuously for
the next year or more, then you can make a commitment for that amount.
In other words, when purchasing the commitment, you enter " $17.68 " as
the hourly commitment amount.
In the legacy CUDs program, your commitment amount is the on-demand price instead. For more
information about the differences between the legacy and new spend-based CUDs program, see
Spend-based CUDs program improvements .
If you expect to scale down your clusters sometimes, you can make a commitment
for a lower amount. Any expenditure above the commitment amount is charged at
the on-demand rate.
As a basis for comparison, compute the on-demand cost of Bigtable capacity, without the application of any commitment discounts:
Monthly cost based on on-demand pricing: $22.10 per hour * 730 hours =
$16,133 per month.
From here, you can calculate the monthly costs and savings that you would see
under a 1-year commitment with a 20% discount compared to a year of
paying the full rates:
Monthly cost of a 1-year commitment, $17.68 per hour * 730 hours = $12,906.40 per month
Total savings per month: $16,133 - $12,906.40 = $3,226.60
Total savings with a 1-year, $22.10/hour commitment: $3,226.60 per month * 12
months = $38,719.20
You can apply similar math to calculating the costs and savings of a
3-year CUD, a 40% discount compared to the on-demand rates:
Monthly cost of a 3-year, $22.10/hour commitment: 13.26 per hour * 730 hours = $9,679.80 per month
Total savings per month: $16,133 - $9,679.80 = $6,453.20
Total savings with a 3-year, $22.10/hour CUD: $6,453.20 per month * 36
months = $232,315.20
A commitment that covers your expected minimum Bigtable usage over
the years to come can lead to significant savings.
Recommendations for choosing a commitment
When considering the purchase of Bigtable CUDs, keep in mind
the following:
Projects : Determine the consistent baseline expenditure per
project while calculating total commitment. Consider that production
loads usually run 100% of the time, while development or staging
environments might run intermittently.
Resources : If you frequently scale your resources up or
down, consider purchasing CUDs only for their baseline predictable usage.
If you have instances that you run only for bursts or brief durations, exclude
them from your calculations.
Your commitment fee applies to every hour during the term of the
commitment, regardless of actual usage. Choose your CUD's commitment
amount carefully, based on both your historical Bigtable usage
and your future expectations. As long as your use of Bigtable
capacity stays higher than your committed expenditure level, you will
enjoy the maximum possible discount for the length of that commitment.
