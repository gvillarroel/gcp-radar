Create an instance and write data with the cbt CLI
If you're learning about Bigtable, you can work through a quickstart
to get a taste of the fundamentals that you would use at scale in a production
environment.
In this quickstart, you perform the following actions:
Connect to a Bigtable instance.
Perform basic administrative tasks.
Write data to a table.
Read data from a table.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Cloud Bigtable and Cloud Bigtable Admin APIs:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable bigtable.googleapis.com bigtableadmin.googleapis.com
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/bigtable.admin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .

Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Cloud Bigtable and Cloud Bigtable Admin APIs:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable bigtable.googleapis.com bigtableadmin.googleapis.com
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/bigtable.admin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Run the following command to install the
cbt CLI
:
gcloud components install cbt
Create a Bigtable instance
Open the Create instance page in the Google Cloud console.
Create an instance
For Instance name , enter Quickstart instance .
For Instance ID , enter quickstart-instance .
Click Continue .
For Storage type , select SSD .
Click Continue .
For Cluster ID , enter quickstart-instance-c1 .
For Region , select a region near you.
For Zone , select Any .
For Node scaling mode , choose Manual allocation .
For Quantity , select 1 .
Click Create to create the instance.
Connect to your instance
Configure the
cbt CLI
to use your project and instance by creating a
.cbtrc file, replacing PROJECT_ID with the ID
for the project where you created your Bigtable instance:
echo project = PROJECT_ID >> ~/.cbtrc && echo instance = quickstart-instance >> ~/.cbtrc
Verify that you set up the .cbtrc file correctly:
cat ~/.cbtrc
The terminal displays the contents of the .cbtrc file, which looks similar
to the following:
project = PROJECT_ID
instance = quickstart-instance
Now you can use the
cbt CLI
with your instance.
Read and write data
Bigtable stores data in tables , which contain rows . Each row
is identified by a row key .
Data in a row is organized into column families , which are groups of columns.
A column qualifier identifies a single column within a column family.
There can be multiple time-stamped cells at the intersection of
a row and column.
Create a table named my-table .
cbt createtable my-table
List your tables:
cbt ls
The command displays output similar to the following:
my-table
Add one column family named cf1 :
cbt createfamily my-table cf1
List your column families:
cbt ls my-table
The command displays output similar to the following:
Family Name GC Policy
----------- ---------
cf1 <never>
Write the values test-value1 and test-value2 to the row r1 , using the
column family cf1 and the column qualifier c1 :
cbt set my-table r1 cf1:c1=test-value1
cbt set my-table r1 cf1:c1=test-value2
Use the cbt read command to read the data you added to the table:
cbt read my-table
The shell displays output similar to the following:
----------------------------------------
r1
cf1:c1 @ 2023/03/22-06:56:11.323000
"test-value1"
cf1:c1 @ 2023/03/22-06:56:04.361000
"test-value2"
Two timestamped values are stored for the same column in row r1 .
Note: In this quickstart you set only two cells, but Bigtable lets you set up to 10,000 cells in a single write request.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources
used in this quickstart, delete the instance. Deleting the .cbtrc file leaves
you ready to work on a different project.
Delete the table my-table :
cbt deletetable my-table
Delete the instance:
cbt deleteinstance quickstart-instance
Delete the .cbtrc file:
rm ~/.cbtrc
Optional: Revoke credentials from the gcloud CLI:
gcloud auth revoke
What's next
Work through a Bigtable codelab .
View the
cbt CLI
reference documentation .
See sample source code for a fraud detection use case .
Write a Hello World application in C# , C++ , Go , Java , Node.js , PHP ,
Python , Ruby , or using the HBase client for Java .
