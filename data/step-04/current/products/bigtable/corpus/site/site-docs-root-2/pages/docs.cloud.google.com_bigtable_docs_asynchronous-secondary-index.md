You can use continuous materialized views as asynchronous secondary indexes for
tables.
Before you read this page, familiarize yourself with
Continuous materialized views .
Data in a Bigtable table is typically indexed by
row keys .
However, you can create a continuous materialized view from a source table and
use it as an asynchronous secondary index. This lets you retrieve the same data using
different query lookup patterns by querying the materialized view.
An asynchronous secondary index is a continuous materialized view that contains a
subset of columns from a source table, along with a row key that is different from the row key in the source table.
These row keys might be based on the following transformations that allow your
application to retrieve the same data based on different query lookup patterns:
Attributes within the source table, such as column qualifiers, column values, or parts of the source row key.
A reformatting of the row key.
A transformation that combines the row key with an attribute.
Bigtable synchronizes asynchronous secondary indexes with the source
table automatically in a way that is eventually consistent .
When to use an asynchronous secondary index
Applications often need to query the same data using different lookup patterns
or attributes. For example, consider an application that retrieves user
information by either the email address or a phone number. You might want the
same level of performance across both query patterns. If you make the email
address your Bigtable row key and store telephone numbers in a
column, then the performance of the phone number lookup is slower because
it requires a full table scan.
To improve query performance when looking up by a telephone number, you can
create a continuous materialized view with a SQL statement. The SQL statement
instructs Bigtable how to restructure your data with a different row key.
A continuous materialized view acts like a table that you can query.
Then you use the view as an asynchronous secondary index. It gives your application
another access path to the same data. Each path uses a different
row key so you can choose an alternative path for each query. To choose the
best path for your query, understand the structure of the row key for each table
and the data that each table stores.
Using a continuous materialized view as an asynchronous secondary index
can improve query performance in the following use cases:
Rekeying your data : If you need to query your data by using a different
key than the source table's row keys, you can then create a continuous
materialized view with the alternative key and query against that view.
Filtering data : If you want to filter the source table and populate only
specific rows of data in the asynchronous secondary index, then provide a WHERE
clause in the SQL query that defines the view.
Attribute keys : If you need to query your data based on a non-key
attribute, such as a column qualifier or value, you can include it in
your ORDER BY clause.
About asynchronous secondary indexes
To use a continuous materialized view in Bigtable as an asynchronous
secondary index, consider the following requirements:
The row key for a new asynchronous secondary index must include the row key of the
source table to help ensure a one-to-one mapping between rows in the source table
and rows in the asynchronous secondary index of the continuous materialized view.
The asynchronous secondary index doesn't have to have the same schema or
attributes as the source table. In the SELECT part of the SQL query, you
must specify which columns from the table are necessary and any SQL
transformations of the data that you want to apply.
The asynchronous secondary index only needs to copy data that you need for the
query pattern. Providing all the source data in the source table is not
required.
In Bigtable, the row key that you choose provides the default
sort order.
To query asynchronous secondary indexes, consider the
following requirements:
Every column in the ORDER BY clause must also be included in the SELECT
clause.
Once you define the asynchronous secondary index, your application must be able
to choose between querying the source table or the materialized
view that represents the asynchronous secondary index.
Applications don't write directly to the index, which continuously
synchronizes with the source table. Always write to the source table.
The asynchronous secondary index is eventually consistent; data is written to
the source table first and then transformed to the asynchronous secondary index
format.
We recommend that you create a covering index. For more information, see the
Covering indexes section of this document.
The ORDER BY clause must contain the unmodified row key of the source
table, and all data must be sorted in an ascending order. The row key in the
source table is always projected to the materialized view; however, it can
be combined with other attributes.
The columns in the ORDER BY clause become part of the structured row key
of the asynchronous secondary index. All other selected columns become non-key column
values in the asynchronous secondary index. If you convert a value in the ORDER BY
clause to a specific GoogleSQL for
Bigtable data type, it
retains its data type in the structured row key of the asynchronous secondary
index.
Covering indexes
A covering index includes all the columns that your queries need. When you
query a covering index, Bigtable can retrieve all the required
data directly from the index, without having to access the source table. We
recommend this approach for optimal performance because it minimizes the number
of disk reads. To create a covering index, make sure that your SELECT
statement specifies all the columns that you need in your queries.
When you want to create a non-covering index, query the index and then use the
results to look up the additional columns that you need from the source table.
Define an asynchronous secondary index
You create an asynchronous secondary index by
creating a continuous materialized view
with a SQL query that defines the asynchronous secondary index.
In the following example, the SQL query creates an asynchronous secondary index that
lets you query user interactions data. The ORDER BY clause defines the
structured row key of the asynchronous secondary index, using a combination of the user's phone
number, user ID, and email address. It also assigns the name interactions to
the activity column family:
SELECT
user [ 'phone' ] AS phone ,
CAST ( user [ 'id' ] AS INT64 ) AS user_id ,
_key AS email ,
activity AS interactions
FROM CLICKS_TABLE
ORDER BY 1 , 2 , 3 ;
The following table explains how the index is created by comparing the view of the same row in the source table with the corresponding asynchronous secondary index:
Source table row
Asynchronous secondary index row
Row key: _key : user1@example.com Attributes: user : {id: "123", phone: "555-123-4567"} activity : {action: "CLICKED_PRODUCT_A"}
Structured row key: phone : 555-123-4567 user_id : 123 email : user1@example.com Attribute: interactions : {action: "CLICKED_PRODUCT_A"}
Row key: _key : user2@example.com Attributes: user : {id: "456", phone: "555-987-6543"} activity : {action: "VIEWED_PRODUCT_B"}
Structured row key: phone : 555-987-6543 user_id : 456 email : user2@example.com Attribute: interactions : {action: "VIEWED_PRODUCT_B"}
Row key: _key : user3@example.com Attributes: user : {id: "1000", phone: "555-111-2222"} activity : {action: "ADDED_TO_CART_PRODUCT_C"}
Structured row key: phone : 555-111-2222 user_id : 1000 email : user3@example.com Attribute: interactions : {action: "ADDED_TO_CART_PRODUCT_C"}
Limitations
To read the output key, which is the asynchronous secondary index key, you can only use SQL queries.
