Client-side metrics descriptions
Client-side metrics are available for multiple Bigtable client
libraries. This page provides a detailed description of each client-side metric.
For Go, C++, and Node.js, these metrics are enabled by default in the supported
versions. For the Java client libraries, the metrics are available as an opt-in
feature or by default, depending on the client library version. For information
about the specific versions, see the "Client library support" section of each
metric.
To learn how to set up and configure client-side metrics, see
Set up client-side metrics . For an
overview, see the Client-side metrics overview .
Metrics are published to the region of the Bigtable cluster that
they are for. If Bigtable can't resolve the cluster for a metric,
like when an operation fails, then the metric is published to the global region
and the cluster tag has the value unspecified .
Use client-side metrics in conjunction with server-side metrics for performance
debugging. For a comprehensive list of Bigtable server-side and
client-side metrics, see Metrics .
Operation latencies
The following table shows the attributes and details of the operation
latencies metric.
Attribute
Description
Full metric
bigtable.googleapis.com/client/operation_latencies
Definition
The total end-to-end latency across all RPC attempts associated with
a Bigtable operation. This metric measures an
operation's round trip from the client to Bigtable and
back to the client and includes all retries.
For ReadRows requests, the operation latencies include
the application processing time for each returned message.

Attribute
Description
Full metric
bigtable.googleapis.com/client/attempt_latencies

The latencies of a client RPC attempt.
Under normal circumstances, this value is identical to
operation_latencies . If the client receives transient
errors, however, then operation_latencies is the sum of
all attempt_latencies and the exponential delays.

Application blocking latencies
The following table shows the attributes and details of the application
blocking latencies metric.
Attribute
Description
Full metric

Definition
The time from when the client receives the response to a
request until the application reads the response. This metric is most
relevant for ReadRows requests. The start and stop times
for this metric depend on the way that you send the read request; see
Application blocking latencies timer
examples for details.

Application blocking latencies timer examples
ReadRows requests are typically sent in one of three ways: iteratively,
asynchronously, or as a future call. The following examples demonstrate the
start and stop times for the application blocking latencies for each type of
ReadRows operation.
Iterative
long totaLatency = 0 ;
ServerStream<Row> stream = bigtableDataClient . readRows ( query );
for ( Row row : stream ) {
timer . start ();
// Do something with row
timer . stop ();
totalLatency += timer . elapsed ();
}
Asynchronous
client . readRowsAsync ( query , new ResponseObserver<Row> () {
@Override
public void onStart ( StreamController streamController ) {
}
@Override
public void onResponse ( Row row ) {
timer . start ();
// Do something with the row
timer . stop ();
totalLatency += timer . elapsed ();
}
@Override
public void onError ( Throwable throwable ) {
// Do something with the error
}
@Override
public void onComplete () {
}
});
Future call
The application blocking latencies should be approximately 0 (no timer) for
this type of ReadRows request.
List<Row> rows = bigtableDataClient . readRowsCallable (). all (). call ( query );
First-response latencies

latencies metric.

The following table shows the attributes and details of the client blocking
latencies metric.
Attribute
Description
Full metric

creates a channel.
