Bigtable backups overview
This page provides an overview of Bigtable backups. The content
presented here is intended for Bigtable administrators and
developers.
Backups let you save a copy of a table's schema and data
and then restore from the backup to a new table later. Bigtable
offers two types of backups. The type of backup you create depends on your
disaster recovery (DR) requirements and the type of storage (HDD or SSD) that
your Bigtable cluster uses.
Standard backups are optimized for long-term retention. When you restore
from a standard backup to an SSD cluster, the restore operation requires
additional optimization by Bigtable to bring the table to
production-level performance. For more information, see
Performance when restoring .
Hot backups provide the most efficient restoration to production-level
performance and low-latency serving. For more information, see Hot
backups .
You can create backups in the following ways:
Enable automated backup to let Bigtable create daily backups
for you.
Create a backup on demand, by using the Google Cloud console, the
gcloud CLI, or a Bigtable client library.
Create a copy of a backup.
Before you read this page, you should be familiar with the
Bigtable overview and Manage
tables .
Features
Fully integrated : Backups are handled entirely by the
Bigtable service, with no need to import or export.
Incremental : A backup shares physical storage with the source table and
other backups of the table.
Cost effective : Using Bigtable backups lets you avoid the
costs associated with exporting, storing, and importing data using other
services.
Automatic expiration : Each backup has a user-defined expiration date
that can be up to 90 days after the backup is
created. You can store a copy of a backup for up to
30 days.
Flexible restore options : You can restore from a backup to a table in a
different instance from where the backup was created.
Automated backup : Enable automated backup to let Bigtable
create daily backups.
Hot backups : Plan for disaster recovery with production-ready hot backups.
Use cases
Backups are useful for the following use cases:
Business continuity
Regulatory compliance
Testing and development
Disaster recovery
Consider the following disaster recovery scenarios:
Goal
Backup strategy
Restoration strategy
Protect against human error: You want to always
have a recent backup of your data ready in case of accidental
deletion or corruption.
Determine the backups creation schedule that's right for your
business needs, such as daily. Optionally, create periodic copies of
the backups and store them in a different project or region for
increased isolation and protection. For even more protection, store the backup
copies in a project or instance with restricted access permissions.
Restore to a new table from the backup or copy, and then re-route
requests to the new table.
Zone unavailability: You need to make sure that in
the unlikely event that a Google Cloud zone becomes unavailable,
your data is still available.
Enable automated backup to let Bigtable create a daily
backup on every cluster in the instance. Alternatively, create backups on
a regular basis and then periodically create a copy of the
most recent backup and store it on one or more clusters in different
zones (optionally in a different instance or project).
If the zone where your serving cluster becomes unavailable, restore
from the remote backup copy to a new table, and then re-route
requests to the new table.
Data corruption: Use a backup to recover
some of a table's data, such as when part of the source table has
become corrupted.
Enable replication and automated backup to create daily backups in
multiple regions, so that if a table becomes corrupted on one cluster,
you have one or more backups that don't share storage on the corrupted
cluster.
Restore from the backup to a new table on the new cluster or instance. Then
write an application using a Bigtable client library or
Dataflow that reads from the new
table and then writes the data back to the source table. When the
data has been copied to the original table, delete the new
table.
Fast recovery: Restore to
full production performance levels quickly, minimizing downtime.
Always maintain a recent hot backup of your table.
Restore to a new table from the hot backup, and then re-route
requests to the new table.
Hot backups
A hot backup is a production-ready backup that is optimized for speedy
recovery, with lower latency when reading from the new table shortly after
restoration. Restoring to production performance from a hot backup is faster
than restoring from a standard backup.
Limitations for hot backups
Hot backups have the following limitations:
You can convert a hot backup to a standard backup, but you can't convert a
standard backup to a hot backup.
You can't create hot backups using automated backup, and you can't create a hot
backup on an HDD cluster.
A copy of a hot backup is always a standard backup. As such, the backup copy
doesn't have the same efficient restoration to production-level performance and
low-latency serving as the hot backup.
Working with Bigtable backups
The following actions are available for Bigtable backups. In all
cases, the destination project, instance, and cluster must already exist .
You are not able to create these resources as part of a backup operation.
You can't create a copy of a backup copy.
A copy of a backup is always a
standard backup, even if the source is a hot backup.
Action
Destination options
Create a standard backup
Any cluster in the same instance as the source table
Create a hot backup
Any cluster in the same instance as the source table. The
instance must use SSD storage.
Restore from a standard or hot backup to a new table
Any instance
Any Bigtable region
Any project
Copy a backup 1, 2
Any instance
Any Bigtable region
Any project
See Manage backups for step-by-step instructions on these
actions as well as operations such as updating and deleting backups.
Use the following to work with Bigtable backups:
The Google Cloud console
The Google Cloud CLI
The Cloud Bigtable client libraries
Backup storage
A table backup that you create manually or programmatically is stored on a
single cluster that you specify. When automated backup is
enabled, a backup is stored on each cluster in the instance.
If your cluster exceeds the recommended limits for CPU or storage utilization
when you create a backup, your backup creation might be delayed. For more
information, see Understand CPU and disk
usage .
A backup of a table includes all the data that was in the table at the time the
backup was created, on the cluster where the backup is created. A backup is
never larger than the size of the source table at the time that the backup is
created.
Bigtable backups are incremental. The amount of storage
that a backup consumes depends on the size of the table and the extent to which
it can share storage of unchanged data with the original table or other backups
of the same table. For that reason, a backup's size depends on the amount of
data divergence since the prior backup.
You can create up to 150 backups per table per
cluster.
You can delete a table that has a backup. To protect your backups, you cannot
delete a cluster that contains a backup, and you cannot delete an instance that
has one or more backups in any cluster.
A backup still exists after you restore from it to a new table. You can delete
it or let it expire when you no longer need it. Backup storage does not count
toward the node storage limit for a project.
Data in backups is encrypted.
Retention
You can specify a retention period of up to 90 days for
a backup. If you create a copy of a backup, the maximum retention period for the
copy is 30 days from the time the copy is created.
You can change the retention period for a backup to keep it for up to
90 days after the backup creation time. For more
information, see Modify a backup or backup
copy .
For tables with automated backup enabled, the retention period is
seven days if you set the policy using the
--enable-automated-backup flag. You can set a custom retention period by
passing in the --automated-backup-retention-period flag, which accepts a value
from 3 days to 90 days. For more information, see Update an automated backup
policy .
Post-restoration storage
The storage cost for a new table restored from a backup is the same as for any
table.
A table restored from a backup might not consume the same amount of storage as
the original table, and it might decrease in size after restoration. The size
difference depends on how recently compaction has occurred on the
source cluster and the destination cluster.
Because compaction occurs on a rolling basis, it's possible that compaction
occurs as soon as the table is created. However, compaction can take up to a
week to occur.
A new table restored from a backup doesn't inherit the garbage collection
policies of the source table. Configure garbage collection policies in the new
table before you begin writing new data to the table. For more information, see
Configure garbage collection .
Costs
Standard network costs apply when working with backups. You are not charged for
backup operations, including creating, copying, or restoring from a backup.
Storage costs
Storage costs are different for standard backups and hot backups.
Standard backup storage costs
To store a standard backup or a copy of a backup, you're charged the standard
backup storage rate for the region that the cluster containing
the backup or backup copy is in.
A standard backup is a complete logical copy of a table. Behind the scenes,
Bigtable optimizes standard backup storage utilization. This
optimization means that a standard backup is incremental — it shares
physical storage with the original table or with other backups of the table
whenever possible. Because of Bigtable's built-in storage
optimizations, the cost to store a standard backup or a copy of a backup might
sometimes be less than the cost of a full physical copy of the table backup.
In replicated instances where automated backup is enabled, the storage costs
might be higher because a backup is created on each cluster daily.
Hot backup storage costs
To store a hot backup, you're charged the
hot backup storage rate
for the region that the cluster that contains the hot backup is located.
Because a hot backup is stored in a ready state, optimized for quick
restoration, you are charged for storage of the entire logical copy of the
table, rather than for incremental portions, as you are with a standard backup.
Costs when copying a backup
When you create a copy of a backup in a different region than the source backup,
you are charged standard network rates for the cost of copying the data to the
destination cluster. You are not charged for network traffic when you create a
copy in the same region as the source backup.
Costs when restoring
When you restore a new table from a backup, you are billed for the network cost
of replication. If the new table is in an instance that uses replication, you
are charged a one-time replication cost for the data to be
copied to all clusters in the instance.
If you restore to a different instance than where the backup was created, and
the backup's instance and the destination instance don't have at least one
cluster in the same region, you are charged a one-time cost for the initial data
copy to the destination cluster at the standard network
rates .
CMEK
When you create a backup in a cluster that is protected by a customer-managed
encryption key (CMEK) , the backup is pinned to the primary
version of the cluster's CMEK key at the time it is taken. Once the backup is
created, its key and key version cannot be modified, even if the KMS key is
rotated.
When you restore from a backup, the key version that the backup is pinned to
must be enabled for the backup decryption process to succeed. The new table is
protected with the latest primary version of the CMEK key for each cluster in
the destination instance. If you want to restore from a CMEK-protected backup to
a different instance, the destination instance must be CMEK-protected as well
but does not need to have the same CMEK configuration as the source instance.
Replication considerations
This section describes additional concepts to understand when backing up and
restoring a table in an instance that uses replication .
Replication and backing up
When you take a backup of a table manually in a replicated instance, you choose
the cluster where you want to create and store the backup. For tables with
automated backup enabled, a daily backup is created on each cluster in the
instance.
You don't have to stop writing to the cluster that contains the backup, but you
should understand how Bigtable handles replicated writes to the
cluster.
A backup is a copy of the table in its state on the cluster where the backup is
stored, at the time the backup is created. Table data that has not yet been
replicated from another cluster in the instance is not included in the backup.
Each backup has a start and end time. Writes that are sent to the cluster
shortly before or during the backup operation might not be included in the
backup. Two factors contribute to this uncertainty:
A write might be sent to a section of the table that the backup has already
copied.
A write to another cluster might not have been replicated to the cluster
that contains the backup.
In other words, there's a chance that some writes with timestamps before the
time of the backup might not be included in the backup.
If this inconsistency is unacceptable for your business requirements, you can
use a consistency token with your write requests to ensure
that all replicated writes are included in a backup.
Backups of replicated tables that are created as part of automated backup are
not exact copies of each other, because backup times can vary from cluster to
cluster.
Replication and restoring
When you restore a backup to a new table, replication to and from the other
clusters in the instance starts immediately after the restore operation has
completed on the destination cluster.
Performance
While creating backups, use the following best practices to ensure that your
performance remains optimal.
Performance when backing up
Creating a backup usually takes less than a minute, although it can take up to
one hour. Under normal circumstances, backup creation does not affect serving
performance.
For optimal performance, don't create a backup of a single table more than once
every five minutes. Creating backups more frequently can potentially lead to an
observable increase in serving latency.
Performance when restoring
Restoring from a backup to a table in a single-cluster instance takes a few
minutes. In replicated instances, restoration takes longer because the data has
to be copied to all the clusters. Bigtable always chooses the most
efficient route to copy data.
If you restore to a different instance from where the backup was created, the
restore operation takes longer than if you restore to the same instance. This is
especially true if the destination instance does not have a cluster in the same
zone as the cluster where the backup was created.
A bigger table takes longer to restore than a smaller table.
If you have an SSD instance, you might initially experience higher read latency,
even after a restore is complete, while the table is optimized. You can check
the status at any time during the restore operation to see if
optimization is still in process.
If you restore to a different instance from where the backup was created, the
destination instance can use HDD or SSD storage. It does not need to use the
same storage type as the source instance.
Access control
IAM permissions control access to backup and restore
operations. Backup permissions are at the instance level and apply to all
backups in the instance.
The account that you use to create a backup of a table must have permission to
read the table and create backups in the instance that the table is in (the
source instance).
The account that you use to copy a backup must have permission to read the
source backup and to create a backup in the destination instance and project.
The account that you use to restore a new table from a backup must have
permission to create a table in the instance that you are restoring to.

Best practices
Before you create a backup strategy, consider the following best practices. For more
information about disaster recovery planning, see the Bigtable
section of
Architecting disaster recovery for cloud infrastructure outages .
Creating backups
Don't back up a table more frequently than once every five minutes.
When you back up a table that uses replication, choose the cluster to store
the backup after considering the following factors:
Cost . One cluster in your instance may be in a lower-cost region
than the others.
Proximity to your application server . You might want to store the
backup as close to your serving application as possible.
If you need to ensure that all replicated writes are included in a backup
when you back up a table in an instance that uses replication, use a
consistency token with your write requests.
Restoring from backups
Plan ahead what you will name the new table if you need to restore from a
backup. The key point is to be prepared ahead of time so that you don't have
to decide when you're dealing with a problem.
If you are restoring a table for a reason other than accidental deletion,
make sure all reads and writes are going to the new table before you delete
the original table.
If you plan to restore to a different instance, create the destination
instance before you initiate the backup restore operation.
To avoid slow table restoration, wait for a restore operation to
complete before you initiate another restoration for the same source table
in the same zone.
Wait at least an hour after creation before you restore from a standard
backup. If you need to restore more quickly, use a hot backup instead.
Quotas and limits
Backup and restore requests and backup storage are subject to
Bigtable quotas and limits .
Limitations
The following limitations apply to Bigtable backups:
General
You can't read directly from a backup.
A backup is a version of a table in a single cluster at a specific time.
Backups don't represent a consistent state. The same also applies to backups
of the same table in different clusters.
You cannot back up more than one table in a single operation.
You cannot export, copy, or move a Bigtable backup to another
service, such as Cloud Storage.
Bigtable backups contain only Bigtable data and
are not integrated with or related to backups for other Google services.
You can't create a backup of a view.
Restoring
You can't restore from a backup to an existing table.
You can only restore to an instance that already exists.
Bigtable does not create a new instance when restoring from a
backup. If the destination instance specified in a restore request does not
exist, the restore operation fails.
If you restore from a backup to a table in an SSD cluster and then delete
the newly restored table, the table deletion might take a while to complete
because Bigtable waits for table optimization to finish.
Copying
You can't create a copy of a backup that is within 24 hours of expiring.
You can't create a copy of a backup copy.
CMEK
A backup that is protected by CMEK must be restored to a new table in an
instance that is CMEK-protected.
When you create a copy of a backup that is CMEK-protected, the destination
cluster must also be CMEK-protected.
