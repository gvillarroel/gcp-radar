Autoscaling
This page explains how autoscaling works. Before you read this page, you should
be familiar with the Overview of Bigtable
and Instances, clusters, and nodes .
In Bigtable, instances are containers for clusters, which are
location-specific resources that handle requests. Each cluster has one or more
nodes, which are compute resources used to manage your data. When you create a
cluster in an instance, you choose either manual node allocation or
autoscaling .
With manual node allocation, the number of nodes in the cluster remains constant
until you change it. When autoscaling is enabled, Bigtable
continuously monitors the cluster and automatically adjusts the number of nodes
in the cluster when necessary. Autoscaling works on both HDD and SSD clusters,
in all Bigtable regions.
You can configure autoscaling in the Google Cloud console, using gcloud , or using
the Cloud Bigtable client library for Java.
When to use autoscaling
We recommend that you enable autoscaling in most cases. The benefits of
autoscaling include the following:
Costs - Autoscaling can help you optimize costs because
Bigtable reduces the number of nodes in your cluster whenever
possible. This can help you avoid over-provisioning.
Performance - Autoscaling lets Bigtable automatically add
nodes to a cluster when a workload changes or there is an increase in data
storage requirements. This helps maintain workload performance objectives by
ensuring that the cluster has enough nodes to meet the target CPU
utilization and storage requirements.
Automation - Autoscaling reduces management complexity. You don't need
to monitor and scale the cluster size manually or write an application to
do these tasks, because the Bigtable service handles them for
you.
Autoscaling alone might not work well for the following workload types, because
even though Bigtable quickly adds nodes when traffic increases, it
can take time to balance the additional nodes.
Bursty traffic
Sudden batch workloads
If your spikes in usage are predictable or regularly scheduled, you can use
autoscaling and adjust the settings before the planned bursts. See Delay while
nodes rebalance for details.
How autoscaling works
Autoscaling is the process of automatically scaling , or changing the size
of, a cluster by adding or removing nodes. When you enable autoscaling,
Bigtable automatically adjusts the size of your cluster for you.
When your cluster's workload or storage needs fluctuate, Bigtable
either scales up , adding nodes to the cluster, or it scales down , removing
nodes from the cluster.
Bigtable autoscaling determines the number of nodes required,
based on the following dimensions:
CPU utilization target
Storage utilization target
Minimum number of nodes
Maximum number of nodes
Each scaling dimension generates a recommended node count, and
Bigtable automatically uses the highest one. This means, for
example, that if your cluster needs 10 nodes to meet your storage utilization
target but 12 to meet your CPU utilization target, Bigtable scales
the cluster to 12 nodes.
As the number of nodes changes, Bigtable continuously optimizes
the storage, rebalancing data across the nodes, to ensure that traffic is spread
evenly and no node is overloaded.
After a cluster is scaled up, Bigtable automatically rebalances
the nodes in your cluster for optimal performance. All requests continue to
reach the cluster while scaling and rebalancing are in progress. See Scaling
limitations for more information.
If a cluster has scaled up to its maximum number of nodes and the CPU
utilization target is exceeded, requests might have high latency or fail. If a
cluster has scaled up to its maximum number of nodes and the storage
utilization limit is exceeded, write requests will fail. See Storage per
node for more details on storage limits.
When a node is added to a small cluster, such as a one-node cluster, you might
observe a temporary increase in latency as the cluster rebalances. This is
because the additional node proportionally doubles the size of the cluster.
Similarly, if a cluster decreases in size from two nodes to one node, some
latency might occur.
When a cluster is scaled down, nodes are removed at a slower rate than when
scaling up, to prevent any impact on latency. See scaling limitations for more details.
Autoscaling parameters
When you create or edit a cluster and choose autoscaling, you define the values
for CPU utilization target, min nodes, and max nodes. You can either configure
the storage utilization target or leave it at the default, which is 50%
(2.5 TB for SSD and
8 TB for HDD).
Parameter
Description
CPU utilization target
A percentage of the cluster's CPU capacity. Can be from 10% to 80%. When a
cluster's CPU utilization exceeds the target that you have set,
Bigtable immediately adds nodes to the cluster. When CPU
utilization is substantially lower than the target, Bigtable
removes nodes. For guidance, see Determine the CPU
utilization target .
Minimum number of nodes
The lowest number of nodes that Bigtable will scale the
cluster down to. If
2x node scaling is
enabled, this must be an even number. This value must be greater than zero
and can't be lower than 10% of the value you set for the maximum number of
nodes. For example, if the maximum number of nodes is 40, the minimum number
of nodes must be at least 4. The 10% requirement is a hard limit. For
guidance, see Determine minimum number of nodes .
Maximum number of nodes
The highest number of nodes that you want to let the cluster scale up to.
If
2x node scaling is
enabled, this must be an even number. This value must be greater than zero
and equal to or greater than the minimum number of nodes. The value can't be
more than 10 times the number that you choose for the minimum number of
nodes. The 10x requirement is a hard limit. For guidance, see
Determine the maximum number of nodes .
Storage utilization target
The maximum number of terabytes per node that you can store in SSD or HDD clusters
before Bigtable scales up. This target ensures that you always
have enough nodes to handle fluctuations in the amount of data that you
store. For more information, see Determine
the storage utilization target . This target doesn't include the infrequent access tier.
Combined usage of SSD and infrequent access
The maximum number of terabytes per node that you can store in SSD and
infrequent access clusters before Bigtable scales up. This
target ensures that you always have enough nodes to handle fluctuations in the
amount of data that you store. For more information, see the
Tiered storage and autoscaling
section of this document.
Configure autoscaling
This section describes how to choose your autoscaling parameters. After you set
your initial values, monitor your cluster and adjust the
numbers if necessary.
Determine the CPU utilization target
Base the CPU utilization target on your unique workload. The
optimal target for your cluster depends on the latency and throughput
requirements of your workload. For more information, see Plan your
Bigtable capacity .
In general, if you observe unacceptably high latency, you should lower the CPU
utilization target.
Determine the storage utilization target
If your application is latency-sensitive, keep storage utilization below 60%.
If your application is not latency-sensitive, you can choose a storage
utilization target of 70% or more. For more information, see
Plan your Bigtable capacity .
For autoscaling, storage utilization is expressed as the number of bytes of
storage per node rather than as a percentage. The storage utilization target is
specified per node but is applied to the entire cluster. The capacity limits for
nodes are 5 TB per node for SSD storage and
16 TB per node for HDD storage.
The following table shows target amounts for typical storage utilization
target percentages. The Google Cloud console accepts the value in TB per node,
and the gcloud CLI, API, and Cloud Bigtable client libraries
accept an integer value in GiB per node.

Tiered storage and autoscaling
Tiered storage ( Preview ) doesn't impact SSD
autoscaling described in the Determine the storage utilization
target section of this document. When you
enable infrequent access as part of tiered storage, autoscaling additionally
makes sure that the combined SSD and the infrequent access storage doesn't
exceed the limit of 32 TB per node. When
the limit is reached, Bigtable scales up automatically.
For example, on an SSD cluster, if you set a storage utilization target of
2.5 TB (50%) per node, and your infrequent access
usage is high enough to push the storage usage with tiered storage over the
limit, Bigtable adds nodes. This happens even if your SSD usage
remains within the 50% target.
The following table helps you understand how autoscaling recommends a node count
based on both the SSD usage and the infrequent access usage:

Tiered storage overview .
Determine the maximum number of nodes
The value that you choose as the maximum number of nodes should be the number of
nodes that the cluster needs to handle your workload's heaviest traffic, even if
you don't expect to reach that volume most of the time. Bigtable
never scales up to more nodes than it needs. You can also think of this number
as the highest number of nodes that you are willing to pay for. For details on
accepted values, see Autoscaling parameters .
Note: If 2x node scaling is
enabled, the maximum number of nodes must be an even number.
The maximum number needs to allow for both the CPU utilization target set by you
and the storage utilization target set by Bigtable.
If you're changing a cluster from manual allocation to autoscaling , find the
highest number of nodes that the cluster has had over the last month or so. Your
autoscaling maximum should be at least that number.
If you are enabling autoscaling for a new cluster in an existing
instance , use metrics from other clusters in the instance as your guidepost.
If you have a new workload and you're not sure how it's going to grow , you
can estimate the number of nodes that you need to meet the built-in storage
utilization target and then adjust the number later.
If you enabled tiered storage , you must account for the storage limit of
32 TB per node. Even if your SSD usage
is low, a large volume of data in the infrequent access tier can trigger node
scaling.
To arrive at this number, estimate the amount of data that you plan to store on
the cluster, and then divide that number by the storage utilization target for
the storage type that you use.
For example, if you store 10 TB on an SSD cluster, you can divide 10 TB by
2.5 TB, which is the storage utilization target set by default for SSD clusters
that use autoscaling. The result is 4, which means that 4 is the number of nodes
that can handle that amount of data, and the maximum should be some number
higher than that .
Using the same formula, the following examples show the number of nodes you
might need for some sample storage amounts:
SSD storage per cluster
Smallest maximum number of nodes
25 TB
10
35 TB
14
50 TB
20
After your cluster is up and running with autoscaling enabled, monitor the
cluster and make sure that the value you choose for maximum number
of nodes is at least as high as the recommended number of nodes for CPU target
and the recommended number of nodes for storage target .
Determine the minimum number of nodes
You can set the minimum as low as 1 to ensure that your Bigtable
can scale down to the smallest, most cost-efficient size
if possible. The cluster never becomes too small because Bigtable
automatically prevents the node count from dropping below the minimum needed to
maintain the CPU and storage utilization targets. See Autoscaling
parameters for details on accepted values.
However, in many cases you will want to set this value to more than one. Choose
a higher number or raise the minimum number of nodes for the following
situations:
You have an upcoming peak scale event, when you expect your
traffic to temporarily increase, and you want to make sure you have enough
capacity.
Your application sends spiky traffic. When new nodes are added,
Bigtable automatically rebalances onto the new nodes. Because
this process can take several minutes, you are often better off taking a
conservative approach and choosing a higher minimum so that your cluster can
seamlessly accommodate the spikes.
You increase the maximum number of nodes. The minimum must always be ten
percent or less of the maximum number of nodes. For example, if you set the
maximum to 30, you must set the minimum to at least 3.
Note: If 2x node scaling is
enabled, the minimum number of nodes must be an even number.
If you increase the value for a cluster's minimum number of nodes,
Bigtable immediately attempts to scale the cluster to the new
minimum. The standard constraints apply,
however; if a zone is out of nodes, additional nodes are not provisioned to meet
the configured minimum. Bigtable continues to attempt to add nodes
and creates an audit log entry for each failed attempt until it successfully
scales the cluster to the new minimum number of nodes. Bigtable
does not change the configured value in this situation. As a result, you might
observe that the cluster's node count is less than the minimum until
scaling is complete.
Fine-tune your settings
After you enable autoscaling, it's important to monitor its behavior and adjust
your settings as needed. Use the monitoring metrics to observe
the following:
Recommended node counts: Pay close attention to the
recommended_node_count_for_cpu and recommended_node_count_for_storage
metrics. These metrics indicate the ideal number of nodes based on your CPU
and storage utilization targets, respectively.
Provisioned node count: Compare the recommended node counts with the
actual number of nodes that are provisioned. If your cluster is consistently
using more nodes than recommended, you can consider reducing the
minimum number of nodes to lower your costs.
Maximum node count: Ensure that your maximum number of
nodes is high enough to allow your cluster to scale up to
meet demand. If you observe that your cluster is frequently hitting the
maximum node count, increase it to provide more capacity.
You can also adjust CPU utilization target for performance . If you observe
latency issues, you might need to lower the
CPU utilization target to ensure that your cluster scales up
more aggressively when demand increases. Conversely, if your cluster is
consistently over-provisioned and your latency is acceptable, you can consider
increasing the CPU target.
Account for replication
In an instance that uses replication, each cluster's autoscaling settings and
activity are completely independent of those for the other clusters in the
instance. You must configure the scaling mode for each cluster in an instance.
In general, for replicated instances, you should enable autoscaling for every
cluster in the instance. Your autoscaling configuration will often be the same
for every cluster in the instance, but might be different depending on the use
case, workload, and performance requirements for each cluster.
Because clusters in a replicated instance do some additional work to
manage replication, you should choose a higher maximum number of nodes for them
than you would for a single-cluster instance. To learn more, see Replication
and performance .
Access control
To configure autoscaling, you need to be a principal in a role that has
create and update permissions
for the cluster and instance that you are configuring.
Monitoring
Bigtable provides several metrics to help you understand how
Bigtable autoscaling is working as it scales up and down to meet
workload requirements. The metrics also can help you gauge whether your
settings are optimal to meet your business's workload and cost requirements. For
example, if you observe that the node count for a cluster is often close to the
maximum number of nodes, you might consider raising the maximum. To learn more
about monitoring your Bigtable resources, see Monitoring an
instance .
The following metrics are displayed in graphs on the
cluster overview page in the Google Cloud console. You can also view these
metrics using Cloud Monitoring .
bigtable.googleapis.com/cluster/autoscaling/min_node_count

bigtable.googleapis.com/cluster/autoscaling/recommended_node_count_for_cpu
bigtable.googleapis.com/cluster/autoscaling/recommended_node_count_for_storage
Logging
Bigtable emits a system event audit log each time it scales a
cluster. The log entry is similar to the following:
Grew from 9 to 10 nodes to maintain CPU utilization at 60%.
You can view autoscaling system event logs on the Bigtable cluster
overview page in the Google Cloud console. You can also view them using
Logs Explorer:
