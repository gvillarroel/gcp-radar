Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
By default, Bigtable encrypts customer content at
rest. Bigtable handles encryption for you without any
additional actions on your part. This option is called Google default encryption .
If you want to control your encryption keys, then you can use customer-managed encryption keys
(CMEKs) in Cloud KMS with CMEK-integrated services including
Bigtable. Using Cloud KMS keys gives you control over their protection
level, location, rotation schedule, usage and access permissions, and cryptographic boundaries.
Using Cloud KMS also lets
you track key usage , view audit logs, and
control key lifecycles.
Instead of Google owning and managing the symmetric
key encryption keys (KEKs) that protect your data, you control and
manage these keys in Cloud KMS.
After you set up your resources with CMEKs, the experience of accessing your
Bigtable resources is similar to using Google default encryption.
For more information about your encryption
options, see Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) .
CMEK with Cloud KMS Autokey
You can either create CMEKs manually to protect your Bigtable
clusters or use Cloud KMS Autokey. With Autokey, key rings and keys are generated on demand to
support resource creation in Bigtable.
Service agents that use the keys for encrypt and decrypt operations are created if they don't
already exist and are granted the required Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. For more
information, see Autokey overview .
Autokey
creates a default key when you create Bigtable clusters.
To set up CMEK manually, see
Use CMEK .
Features
Security : CMEK provides the same level of security as Google's default
encryption but provides more administrative control.
Data access control : Administrators can rotate, manage access to, and
disable or destroy the key used to protect data at rest in
Bigtable.
Auditability: All actions on your CMEK keys are logged and viewable
in Cloud Logging . Cloud EKM keys support
Key Access Justification , which adds a justification
field to all key requests. With select external key management partners, you
can automatically approve or deny these requests, based on the justification.
Comparable performance: Bigtable CMEK-protected instances
offer comparable performance to Bigtable instances that use
Google default encryption.
Flexibility: You can use the same CMEK key in multiple projects,
instances, or clusters, or you can use separate keys, depending on your
business needs.
Cross-region protection: You can enable CMEK in instances that have
clusters in any region where Bigtable is available. Each
cluster is protected by a CMEK key in that cluster's region.
Pricing
Cloud KMS charges for the cost of the key and any cryptographic
operations performed using that key. See Cloud KMS pricing for details.
You're billed for the operation costs when Bigtable asks the
Cloud KMS key to perform an encryption or decryption operation. Each
encryption or decryption request is sent from every table on every cluster in
the instance. Because Bigtable uses envelope encryption , these costs per table are generally low, given the small
number of expected cryptographic operations. If you store many tables in a
CMEK-protected instance, your costs are higher.
There are no additional Bigtable costs for using CMEK-enabled
instances.
What is protected with CMEK
In a CMEK-protected instance, Bigtable uses your CMEK key to
protect your data at rest. This includes data in all tables in the cluster. Data
stored on both HDD and SSD storage is protected.
Some data is protected by Google default encryption at rest and not by the CMEK
key:
A subset of row keys that mark range boundaries and are used for routing
Debugging data including core dumps and operational logs
Data in transit or in memory
A subset of timestamp values used for garbage collection
Bigtable uses envelope encryption
for data at rest. The CMEK key is used as a key encryption key (KEK) to encrypt
other keys used by Bigtable. When you rotate the CMEK key,
Bigtable only needs to re-encrypt the intermediate keys.
Enabling CMEK
At a high level, to use CMEK with Bigtable, you follow these
steps:
Create and configure a CMEK key in each region where your
instance's clusters are going to be.
Create a new Bigtable instance, selecting a CMEK key for each
cluster in the instance. A cluster's CMEK key must be in the same region as
the cluster.
Schedule a key rotation for each key.
Applications that use Bigtable do not need to specify a key or
encryption config when reading, writing, or deleting data.
Bigtable is able to access the key on your behalf after you grant
the Cloud KMS Encrypter/Decrypter role to the
Bigtable service agent .
For detailed instructions, see Use CMEK .
You can use the following when you work with CMEK for Bigtable.
Google Cloud console
Google Cloud CLI
All generally available (GA) client libraries that call
the Cloud Bigtable APIs.
You can also access the Cloud Bigtable Admin API directly, but we strongly
recommend that you do so only if you cannot use a Bigtable client
library that makes CMEK calls to the API.
Key management
Key management operations are performed using Cloud KMS.
Bigtable cannot detect or act upon any key changes until they are
propagated by Cloud KMS. Some operations, such as disabling or
destroying a key, can take up to 4 hours to propagate; changes to a key's
permissions usually propagate more quickly.
After you create at least one table in a CMEK-protected instance,
Bigtable validates the key for each table in each cluster every 5
minutes.
If Bigtable detects a disabled key, it disables one cluster at a
time in a cascading fashion until all clusters in the instance are disabled.
After the first cluster reports a key is disabled or destroyed and until the
instance is disabled, some data requests might succeed and others return an
error. Any data operations that are sent to a cluster that has been disabled
return a FAILED_PRECONDITION or NOT_FOUND error.
Additionally, because Bigtable replication is eventually
consistent, it's possible that a cluster might have acknowledged a write request
but not yet replicated it to the other clusters in the instance before it was
disabled.
The Bigtable process of automatically disabling all clusters in
an instance after one key is disabled can take up to several hours. To avoid
this state, we recommend that you always disable all of an instance's keys at
the same time.
Key Point: Always disable the keys for every cluster in the instance at the same
time. Don't disable one and wait for Bigtable to disable the rest.
When a Bigtable cluster is disabled, the following administrator
operations are restricted for the entire instance:
Creating a cluster
Deleting a cluster
Creating a table
Modifying a column family
Restoring a table
You are still able to delete the instance, delete a table, and delete a backup.
If Bigtable's calls to Cloud KMS detect that a formerly
disabled key has been re-enabled, Cloud KMS restores access to the
Bigtable cluster automatically.
If a Cloud KMS key has been destroyed, then any Bigtable
instance that has a cluster that was encrypted with that key becomes permanently
inaccessible.
Caution: If a Cloud KMS key becomes inaccessible due to configuration
changes such as IAM policy or VPC-SC setting, the cluster will be disabled. Read
and write requests will be blocked until the key becomes accessible again after
fixing the configuration. Caution: If a cluster remains disabled for more than 30 consecutive days,
Bigtable automatically deletes it. To avoid permanent data loss,
don't leave CMEK keys in an inaccessible state for an extended time. Warning: If a Cloud KMS key is destroyed and cannot be recovered, any
Bigtable cluster encrypted with that key becomes permanently
inaccessible.
How an unavailable key status is handled
In rare scenarios, such as during periods when Cloud KMS is
unavailable, Bigtable may be unable to retrieve the status of a
key from Cloud KMS.
If a Bigtable cluster is protected by a key that is enabled at the
time at which Bigtable is first unable to communicate with
Cloud KMS, Bigtable continues to support full instance
operations on a best-effort basis for up to one hour, to minimize the impact of
any such incident on your workload.
After an hour, if Bigtable is still unable to connect with
Cloud KMS, Bigtable begins taking the
instance offline as a protective measure. The data in your
Bigtable instance remains inaccessible until your instance can
reconnect with Cloud KMS and Cloud KMS responds that the key
is active.
Conversely, if a cluster in your Bigtable instance is protected by
a key that was disabled prior to the point at which Bigtable is
first unable to communicate with Cloud KMS, your instance remains
inaccessible until it is able to reconnect to Cloud KMS and you have
re-enabled your key.
External key considerations
When you use a Cloud EKM, Google has no control over the availability
of your externally managed key in the external key management partner system.
If the externally managed key is unavailable, Bigtable continues
to support cluster operations on a best-effort basis for up to one hour.
After an hour, if Bigtable is still unable to connect with
Cloud KMS, it begins taking the instance offline as a protective
measure. The data in your Bigtable instance remains inaccessible
until the instance can reconnect with Cloud KMS and Cloud KMS
responds that the external key is active.
If you plan to use an external key for a Bigtable instance
that has clusters in more than one region, make sure your key is supported in
those regions. For details, see External key managers and regions . Additionally, you should not use a combination of
external and non-external keys in the same instance.
To learn more about using external keys with Cloud Key Management Service, see Cloud External Key Manager
(Cloud EKM) .
Organization policies
Bigtable supports organization policy constraints to help ensure
CMEK usage across an organization. For details on how to use organization
policies, see CMEK organization policies .
Backups
Like other data, a backup is protected by the CMEK key for the cluster that the
backup is stored on. New tables that are restored from a backup are protected
by the CMEK key or keys for the cluster where they are restored. For further
details about how CMEK affects backups and restore operations, see Backups . To learn how to create or restore from a backup, see
Manage backups .
Logging
You can audit the requests that Bigtable sends to
Cloud KMS on your behalf in Cloud Logging , if
you have enabled Cloud KMS audit logs for the
Cloud KMS API in your project. You can expect a few log entries every 5
minutes or so per table in each cluster.
Limitations
CMEK can only be configured at the cluster level. You cannot configure
CMEK on backups, tables, or app profiles.
A cluster's CMEK key must be in the same region as the cluster. When you
create a Cloud KMS key ring , be sure to
select the region that corresponds with your planned Bigtable
zonal configuration .
The encryption configuration of a Bigtable resource (an
instance, cluster, table or backup) is immutable.
Non-CMEK instances cannot be converted to use CMEK.
CMEK instances cannot be converted to use Google default encryption.
Clusters created with a CMEK key cannot be reconfigured to use
a different key.
CMEK-protected Bigtable resources (instances, clusters,
tables, or backups) tied to a key that has been made inaccessible as the
result of a user-triggered action (such as disabling or destroying a key,
or by revoking the Encrypter/Decrypter role) for more than 30 consecutive
days are automatically deleted .
If you re-enable a disabled CMEK key to restore access to
Bigtable instances protected by that key, some Data API
requests might time out while your data is brought back online.
For up to five minutes after a table is created in a CMEK-protected
instance, the key version and key status might be reported as unknown.
However, any data written to the table is still protected with the CMEK key
during that time.
Disabling or deleting only one version instead of all versions of a key that
Bigtable uses can result in unpredictable behavior. Always
disable or delete all versions of a CMEK key.
