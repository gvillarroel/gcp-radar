App profiles overview
An application profile, or app profile , stores settings that tell your
Bigtable instance how to handle incoming requests from an application.
When your application connects to a Bigtable instance, it uses
either the default app profile or an app profile specified by you.
Bigtable uses that app profile for requests that the application
sends over that connection.
An app profile is either a standard app profile or a Data Boost app profile,
depending on the type of compute it uses. A standard app profile uses
provisioned cluster nodes for compute and is typically used for
application-serving traffic. A Data Boost app profile uses serverless
compute, which is designed for high-throughput read jobs and queries. For more
information about Data Boost, read the Data Boost
overview .
This page describes app profiles and provides guidance on using them.
For code samples showing how to use an app profile in your application, see
Connect with a custom app
profile .
Use a separate app profile for each workload
When you create a Bigtable instance, a default app
profile is created automatically, and its settings depend
on the number of clusters the instance has. To take full advantage of the
benefits of app profiles, you should create and use additional app profiles and
use a different app profile for each application or workload.
App profiles are especially important for instances that have two or more
clusters, but even if your instance has only one cluster, you should use a
unique app profile for each application that you run, or for different
components within a single application.
The following sections describe the benefits of creating and using multiple app
profiles.
Workload isolation
Using separate app profiles lets you use different Bigtable
compute and routing policies for different purposes. For example, consider a
situation when you want to prevent a batch read job (workload A) from increasing
CPU usage on clusters that handle an application's steady reads and writes
(workload B). You can take one of the following approaches:
Create a standard app profile for workload B that routes to a cluster group
that excludes one cluster. Then you create a separate standard app profile
for workload A that specifies single-cluster routing to the cluster that
workload B doesn't send requests to.
Use a standard app profile, which uses cluster nodes for compute, configured
to route to any cluster for workload B, and create a Data Boost app
profile for use against a single cluster with workload A. Data Boost
uses serverless compute, while the application traffic uses cluster nodes
for compute.
You can change the settings for one application or function without affecting
other applications that connect to the same data.
Observability
Using separate app profiles for different workloads gives you better insight
into your applications' usage of Bigtable, because metrics are
available per app profile. This increase in observability can be helpful in the
following ways:
You're able to look at latency at the app profile level to help you
determine which application might be impacting overall performance.
Monitoring the CPU utilization per app
profile for a workload using a standard
app profile can help you troubleshoot CPU utilization issues or make decisions about the size or
location of the cluster, so you can optimize usage and reduce costs.
Metrics at the app profile level are useful if you need to
seek support , because you're better
able to share the exact workload that is causing an issue.
You can use the Bigtable Google Cloud console to view separate graphs
of your Bigtable metrics for each app profile. To learn which
metrics that are available at the profile level, see the table
at System insights charts for Bigtable
resources .
Standard app profiles
A standard app profile routes traffic to an instance's clusters using the
clusters' nodes.
Routing
A standard app profile defines the routing
policy that
Bigtable uses and controls whether single-row
transactions are allowed. A standard app
profile also lets you specify the priority
level for requests sent using the app
profile.
Request priority
You can specify the priority that Bigtable should give to a standard
app profile's data requests. To review the priority levels that are available, see
Configure request priorities .
Data Boost app profiles
A Data Boost app profile lets you use Data Boost's serverless compute to
isolate high-throughput jobs and queries from app serving traffic. A
Data Boost app profile doesn't let you configure request priority, and the
only routing policy available is single-cluster. For more information, see the
Data Boost
overview .
App profile changes
If you need to change the routing policy or request priority for a workload, you
can update the app profile that is used for the workload. You can also convert
an app profile from standard to Data Boost isolation or from Data Boost
to standard isolation. Converting a standard app profile to use Data Boost
removes the request priority settings from the app profile as well as any
routing policies that aren't single-cluster.
Changes to an app profile are effective immediately.
However, in many cases, instead of modifying an app profile that is in use, you
should create a new app profile with a different configuration, like you would
for a new use case, and then change your application code to use the new app
profile. Creating a new app profile to make changes for a workload
ensures that you don't inadvertently change the app profile for any other
workloads that use the app profile.
If you change an app profile from standard to Data Boost, the type of
compute that is used for the app profile's traffic is changed to serverless, along with
pricing. For more information, see the Data Boost
overview and Bigtable
pricing .
Similarly, if you change an app profile from Data Boost to standard, traffic
that is sent by the app profile starts using cluster nodes for compute. This
means that all clusters that the app profile routes to must have enough nodes to
satisfy CPU usage requirements. For more
information, see Nodes .
To see how to view, create, and update app profiles, see Create and
configure app profiles .
Default app profile
When you create an instance, Bigtable automatically creates a
default app profile for the instance. The default app profile is a standard app
profile, but you can convert it to a Data Boost profile. If your application
does not specify an app profile, or if you use the HBase shell to connect to
your instance, Bigtable uses the settings in the default app
profile.
The settings in an instance's default app profile depend on the number of
clusters the instance had when you first created it:
If you created the instance with 1 cluster, the default app profile uses
single-cluster routing , and it
enables single-row
transactions . This ensures
that adding additional clusters later doesn't change the behavior of your
existing applications.
If you created the instance with 2 or more clusters, the default app
profile uses multi-cluster routing
to any cluster. Single-row transactions are never allowed with multi-cluster
routing.
The default app profile does not change when you add or remove clusters.
You must manually update the default app profile to
change its settings. However, as a best practice you should create and use a
new app profile instead of changing the default app profile.
Custom app profiles
A custom app profile is an app profile that you create and configure. An
instance can have up to 2,000 app profiles.
Every app profile that is not the default is considered a custom app profile.
