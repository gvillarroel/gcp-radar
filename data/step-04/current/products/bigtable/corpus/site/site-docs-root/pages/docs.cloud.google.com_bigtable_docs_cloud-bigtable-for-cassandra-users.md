Bigtable for Cassandra users
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document is for software developers and database administrators who want to
migrate existing applications or design new applications for use with
Bigtable as a database. This document applies your knowledge of
Apache Cassandra to using Bigtable to describe concepts that you should
understand before migrating. For information about open-source tools that you
can use to complete your migration, see Migrating from Cassandra to
Bigtable .
Bigtable and Cassandra are distributed databases. They implement
multidimensional key-value
stores that can support
tens of thousands of queries per second (QPS), low latency reads and writes,
storage that scales up to petabytes of data, and tolerance for node failure.
When is Bigtable a good destination for Cassandra workloads
The best Google Cloud service for your Cassandra workload depends on your
migration goals and the Cassandra functionality that you require after
migration.
If one or more of the following conditions apply, Bigtable is
optimal:
You want a fully managed service with no maintenance windows and high
availability.
You need elastic scaling that responds to changes in server traffic
automatically.
You require consistent single-digit millisecond latency for reads and
writes.
You use Cassandra collection types, counters, or materialized views in
addition to scalar types, which Bigtable is optimized for.
You have an application that uses the USING TIMESTAMP parameter.
Your write throughput and latency are just as important as reads.
You rely on one of Cassandra's eventually consistent replication models.
Your use case requires cost-effective storage.
To migrate applications without any code changes, you might choose to
self-manage Cassandra on GKE or use a Google Cloud
partner such as DataStax or ScyllaDB. If your application is read-heavy and
you're willing to refactor your code to obtain relational database capabilities
and strong consistency, you might consider Spanner.
This document provides tips on what to consider when refactoring your
application, if you choose Bigtable as the migration target for
your Cassandra workloads.

Terminology comparison
Although many of the concepts used in Bigtable and Cassandra are
similar, each database has slightly different naming conventions and subtle
differences.
One of the core building blocks of both databases is the sorted string table
(SSTable). In both architectures, SSTables are created to persist data that's
used to respond to read queries.
In a blog post
(2012) ,
Ilya Grigorik writes the following: "An SSTable is a simple abstraction to
efficiently store large numbers of key-value pairs while optimizing for high
throughput, sequential read or write workloads."
The following table outlines and describes shared concepts and the corresponding
terminology that each product uses:
Cassandra
Bigtable
primary key : a unique single or multi-field value that
determines data placement and ordering.
partition
key : a single or multi-field value that determines data placement
by consistent hash.
clustering column : a single
or multi-field value that determines the lexicographical data sorting
within a partition.
row key : a unique, single byte
string that determines the placement of data by a lexicographical
sort. Composite keys are imitated by joining the data of multiple columns by
using a common delimiter—for example, the hash (#) or percent (%)
symbols.
node : a machine responsible for reading and writing data
that's associated with a series of primary key partition hash ranges. In
Cassandra, data is stored on
block-level storage
that's attached to the node server.
node : a virtual compute resource responsible for reading
and writing data that's associated with a series of row key ranges. In
Bigtable, data isn't colocated with the compute nodes.
Instead, it's stored in Colossus ,
Google's distributed file system. Nodes are given temporary responsibility
for serving various ranges of data based on the operation load and the
health of other nodes in the cluster.
data center : similar to a Bigtable cluster,
except some aspects of topology and replication strategy are configurable
in Cassandra.
rack : a grouping of nodes in a data center that influences
replica placement.
cluster : a group of nodes in the same geographic
Google Cloud zone, colocated for latency and replication concerns.
cluster : a Cassandra deployment consisting of a collection
of data centers.
instance : a group of Bigtable clusters in
different Google Cloud zones or regions between which replication and
connection routing occur.
vnode : a fixed range of hash values assigned to a specific
physical node. Data in a vnode is physically stored on the Cassandra node
in a series of SSTables.
tablet : an SSTable containing all data for a contiguous
range of lexicographically sorted row keys. Tablets are not stored
on nodes in Bigtable, but are stored in a series of SSTables
on Colossus.
replication factor : the number of replicas of a vnode that are
maintained across all nodes in the data center. The replication factor is
configured independently for each data center.
replication : the process of replicating the data stored in
Bigtable to all clusters in the instance. Replication within
a zonal cluster is handled by the Colossus storage layer.
table (formerly column family ): a logical
organization of values that's indexed by the unique primary key.
table : a logical organization of values that's indexed by
the unique row key.
keyspace : a logical table namespace that defines the
replication factor for the tables it contains.
Not applicable. Bigtable handles keyspace concerns
transparently.
map : a Cassandra collection type that holds key-value pairs.
column family : a user-specified namespace that groups
column qualifiers for more efficient reads and writes. When querying
Bigtable using SQL,
column families are
treated like Cassandra's maps .
map key : key that uniquely identifies a key-value entry in a
Cassandra map
column qualifier : a label for a value stored in a table
that's indexed by the unique row key. When querying Bigtable using
SQL, columns are
treated like keys of a map .
column : the label for a value stored in a table that's
indexed by the unique primary key.
column : the label for a value stored in a table that's
indexed by the unique row key. The column name is constructed by combining
the column family with the column qualifier.
cell : a timestamp value in a table that's associated with
the intersection of a primary key with the column.
cell : a timestamp value in a table that's associated with
the intersection of a row key with the column name. Multiple timestamped
versions can be stored and retrieved for each cell.
counter : an incrementable field type optimized for integer sum
operations.
counters : cells that use specialized data types for integer sum
operations. For more information, see
Create and update
counters .
load balancing policy : a policy that you configure in the application
logic to route operations to an appropriate node in the cluster. The policy
accounts for the data center topology and vnode token ranges.
application profile : settings that
instruct Bigtable how to route a client API call to the
appropriate cluster in the instance. You can also use the application profile
as a tag to segment metrics. You configure the application profile in the
service.
CQL : the
Cassandra Query Language ,
a language like SQL that's used for table creation, schema
changes, row mutations, and queries.
The Cassandra to
Bigtable client for Java is a seamless replacement for your
Cassandra drivers. The Java client understands your CQL queries, and lets you
use Bigtable transparently with your existing Cassandra-based
application without rewriting code.
The Cassandra to
Bigtable proxy adapter is a standalone layer that you can
run parallel to your application and connect to Bigtable as
another Cassandra node. The proxy adapter provides compatibility with CQL and
supports dual-write and bulk migrations. This functionality is similar to what
the Cassandra to Bigtable client for Java offers.
Bigtable APIs are the client libraries and the
gRPC APIs used for instance and cluster creation, table and
column family creation, row mutation, and query execution. The Bigtable
SQL API is familiar to CQL
users.
materialized view : a SELECT statement that defines a set
of rows that corresponds to rows in an underlying source table. When the source
table changes, Cassandra updates the materialized view automatically.
continuous materialized view : a fully-managed, pre-computed result of
a SQL query that is incrementally and automatically updated from a source table.
For more information, see
Continuous materialized views .
Product overviews
The following sections provide an overview of the design philosophy and key
attributes of Bigtable and Cassandra.
Bigtable
Bigtable provides many of the core features described in the
Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured
Data
paper. Bigtable separates the compute nodes, which serve client
requests, from the underlying storage management. Data is stored on Colossus.
The storage layer automatically replicates the data to provide durability that
exceeds levels provided by standard Hadoop Distributed File System
(HDFS)
three-way replication.
This architecture provides consistent reads and writes within a cluster, scales
up and down without any storage redistribution cost, and can rebalance workloads
without modifying the cluster or schema. If any data processing node becomes
impaired, the Bigtable service replaces it transparently.
Bigtable also supports asynchronous
replication .
In addition to gRPC and client libraries for various programming languages,
Bigtable maintains compatibility with the open source Apache
HBase
Java client
library
, an alternative open source database engine implementation of the
Bigtable paper.
The following diagram shows how Bigtable physically separates the
processing nodes from the storage layer:
Figure 1 : Clients communicate through a routing layer to processing nodes, and then these
nodes communicate with the storage layer.
In the preceding diagram, the middle processing node is only responsible for
serving data requests for the C dataset in the storage layer. If
Bigtable identifies that range-assignment rebalancing is required
for a dataset, the data ranges for a processing node are straightforward to
change because the storage layer is separated from the processing layer.
The following diagram shows, in simplified terms, a key range rebalancing and a
cluster resizing:
Figure 2 : Rebalancing spreads processing over
multiple nodes while resizing adds processing nodes.
The Rebalancing image illustrates the state of the Bigtable
cluster after the leftmost processing node receives an increased number of
requests for the A dataset. After the rebalancing occurs, the middle node,
instead of the leftmost node, is responsible for serving data requests for the
B dataset. The leftmost node continues to service requests for the
A dataset.
Bigtable can rearrange row key ranges in order to balance dataset
ranges across an increased number of available processing nodes. The
Resizing image shows the state of the Bigtable cluster after
you add a node.
Cassandra
Apache Cassandra is an open source database that is partly influenced by
concepts from the Bigtable paper. It uses a distributed node
architecture, where storage is colocated with the servers that respond to data
operations. A series of virtual nodes (vnodes) are randomly assigned to each
server to serve a portion of the cluster keyspace.
Data is stored in the vnodes based on the partition key. Typically, a consistent
hash function is used to generate a token to determine data placement. As with
Bigtable, you can use an order-preserving partitioner for token
generation, and thus also for data placement. However, the Cassandra
documentation discourages this
approach
because the cluster will likely become unbalanced, a condition that's difficult
to remedy. For this reason, this document assumes that you use a consistent
hashing strategy to generate tokens that result in data distribution across
nodes.
Cassandra provides fault tolerance through availability levels that are
correlated with the tunable consistency level, allowing a cluster to serve
clients while one or more nodes are impaired. You define geographic replication
through a configurable data replication topology
strategy .
You specify a consistency level for each operation. The typical setting is
QUORUM (or LOCAL_QUORUM in certain multiple-data center topologies). This
consistency level setting requires a replica node majority to respond to the
coordinator node for the operation to be considered successful. The replication
factor, which you configure for every keyspace, determines the number of data
replicas that are stored in each data center in the cluster. For example, it's
typical to use a replication factor value of 3 to provide a practical balance
between durability and storage volume.
The following diagram shows in simplified terms a cluster of six nodes with each
node's key-range divided into five vnodes. In practice, you can have more nodes,
and likely will have more vnodes.
Figure 3 : Cassandra architecture that includes a
coordinator node, local node storage, and other nodes, each with vnodes.
In the preceding diagram, you can see the path of a write operation, with a
consistency level of QUORUM , that originates from a client application or
service ( Client ). For the purposes of this diagram, the key ranges are shown
as alphabetical ranges. In reality, the tokens produced by a hash of the primary
key are very large signed integers.
In this example, the key hash is M , and the vnodes for M are on nodes 2,
4, and 6. The coordinator must contact each node where the key hash ranges are
stored locally so that the write can be processed. Since the consistency level
is QUORUM , two replicas (a majority) must respond to the coordinator node
before the client is notified that the write is complete.
Note: If you use a load balancing policy that recognizes tokens, a vnode replica
is chosen as the coordinator node, eliminating one network hop.
In contrast to Bigtable, moving or changing key ranges in
Cassandra requires that you physically copy the data from one node to another.
If one node is overloaded with requests for a given token hash range, adding
processing for that token range is more complex in Cassandra as compared to
Bigtable.
Geographic replication and consistency
Bigtable and Cassandra handle geographic (also known as multi-
region ) replication and consistency differently. A Cassandra cluster consists
of processing nodes grouped into racks, and racks are grouped into data centers.
Cassandra uses a network topology strategy that you configure to determine how
vnode replicas are distributed across hosts in a data center. This strategy
reveals Cassandra's roots as a database originally deployed on physical,
on-premises data centers. This configuration also specifies the replication
factor for each data center in the cluster.
Cassandra uses data center and rack configurations to improve the fault
tolerance of the data replicas. During read and write operations, the topology
determines the participant nodes that are required to provide consistency
guarantees. You must manually configure nodes, racks, and data centers when you
create or extend a cluster. Within a cloud environment, a typical Cassandra
deployment treats a cloud zone as a rack and a cloud region as a data center.
You can use Cassandra's quorum controls to adjust the consistency guarantees for
each read or write operation. The strength levels of eventual consistency can
vary, including options that require a single replica node ( ONE ), a
single-data center replica node majority ( LOCAL_QUORUM ), or a majority of all
replica nodes across all data centers ( QUORUM ).
In Bigtable, clusters are zonal resources. A
Bigtable instance can contain a single cluster, or it can be a
group of fully replicated clusters . You can place
instance clusters in any combination of
zones
across any regions that Google Cloud offers. You can add and remove
clusters from an instance with minimal impact to other clusters in the instance.
In Bigtable, writes are performed (with read-your-writes
consistency )
on a single cluster and will be eventually consistent in the other instance
clusters. Because individual cells are versioned by timestamp, no writes are
lost, and each cluster serves the cells that have the most current timestamps
available.
The service exposes the cluster consistency status. The Cloud Bigtable API
provides a mechanism to obtain a table-level consistency token. You can use this
token to ascertain whether all changes that were made to that table before the
token was created were replicated completely.
Transaction support
Although neither database supports complex multi-row transactions, each has some
transaction support.
Cassandra has a lightweight transaction
(LWT)
method that provides atomicity for updates to column values in a single
partition. Cassandra also has compare and
set
semantics that complete row read operation and value comparison before a write
is initiated.
Bigtable supports fully consistent, single-row writes within a
cluster. Single-row
transactions
are further enabled through the read-modify-write and check-and-mutate
operations. Multi-cluster routing application profiles don't support single-row
transactions.
Data model
Both Bigtable and Cassandra organize data into tables that
support lookups and range scans using the row's unique identifier. Both systems
are classified as NoSQL
wide-column
stores.
In Cassandra, you must use CQL to create the full table schema in advance,
including the primary key definition along with the column names and their
types. Primary keys in Cassandra are unique composite values that consist of a
mandatory partition key and an optional cluster key. The partition key
determines a row's node placement, and the cluster key determines the sort order
within a partition. When creating schemas, you must be aware of potential
tradeoffs between executing efficient scans within a single
partition
and system costs that are associated with maintaining large
partitions .
In Bigtable, you need only create the table and define its column
families ahead of time. Columns aren't declared when tables are created, but
they're created when application API calls add cells to table rows.
Row keys are lexicographically ordered across the Bigtable
cluster. Nodes within Bigtable automatically balance nodal
responsibility for key ranges, often referred to as tablets and sometimes as
splits
. Bigtable row keys frequently consist of several field values
that are
joined
using a commonly used separator character that you choose (such as a percent
sign). When separated, the individual string components are analogous to the
fields of a Cassandra primary key.
Row key design
In Bigtable, the unique identifier of a table row is the row
key
. The row key must be a single unique value across an entire table. You can
create multi-part keys by concatenating disparate elements that are separated by
a common delimiter. The row key determines the global data sort order in a
table. The Bigtable service dynamically determines the key ranges
that are assigned to each node.
In contrast to Cassandra, where the partition key hash determines row placement
and the clustering columns determine ordering, the Bigtable row
key provides both nodal assignment and ordering. As with Cassandra, you should
design a row key in Bigtable so that rows you want to retrieve
together are stored together. However, in Bigtable, you're not
required to design the row key for placement and ordering before you use a
table.
Data types
The Bigtable service doesn't enforce column data types that the
client sends. The client libraries provide helper
methods
to write cell values as bytes, UTF-8 encoded strings, and big-endian encoded
64-bit
integers
(big-endian encoded integers are required for atomic increment operations).
Column family
In Bigtable, a column family determines which columns in a table
are stored and retrieved together. Each table needs at least one column family,
though tables frequently have more (the limit is 100 column families for each
table). You must explicitly create column families before an application can use
them in an operation.
Column qualifiers
Each value that's stored in a table at a row key is associated with a label
called a column qualifier . Because column qualifiers are only labels, there's
no practical limit to the number of columns that you can have in a column
family. Column qualifiers are often used in Bigtable to represent
application data.
Cells
In Bigtable, a cell is the intersection of the row key and column
name (a column family combined with a column qualifier). Each cell contains one
or more timestamped values that can be supplied by the client or automatically
applied by the service. Old cell values are reclaimed based on a garbage
collection policy that's configured at the column family level.
Secondary indexes
You can use continuous materialized views as asynchronous secondary indexes for
tables to query the same data using different lookup patterns or attributes. For
more information, see Create an asynchronous secondary
index .
Data modeling: flexibility with collections
The Cassandra to Bigtable proxy adapter
turns Cassandra collection types, such as maps, sets, and lists, into column
families in Bigtable. This makes using Bigtable
with Cassandra collection types very efficient, as individual columns can be
written and read much faster than single blobs.
With Bigtable, you can build applications with large, dynamic
collections without the performance trade-offs required by Cassandra, for the
following reasons:
Bigtable stores collection elements as individual cells, so that
operations on elements are highly granular. This means that a single map update
translates to a lightweight cell write, which provides high performance and
scalability.
Bigtable collections have no practical size limit, apart from
the general row size limits .
Bigtable maintains consistent low latency regardless of how
large the collection grows, as shown in
Figure 4 .
In contrast, Cassandra documentation encourages you to
strictly limit the use of collection types and to often cap the element counts to small
numbers due to performance degradation. Because Cassandra reads collection
columns as a whole, large collections inevitably cause read latency spikes and
potential node instability.
You can bypass these limits with workarounds such as frozen collections or
storing data as JSON strings, which sacrifice performance by
introducing a read-modify-write tax . This overhead forces the database to read,
deserialize, update, and rewrite the entire object for any change. Furthermore,
Cassandra treats these JSON blobs as opaque text, requiring all parsing logic in
your application layer. This is unlike Bigtable, which provides
built-in, server-side processing for JSON strings through SQL API functions .
Figure 4 : Write latency for a single blob
storage is 4.3x that of column families.
Bigtable lets you combine fixed schema elements with dynamic ones
without compromises. This gives your applications the flexibility to enforce
structure where it matters while remaining agile, which lets you evolve your
data model without extensive migrations or downtime. It also supports modern
workloads, such as machine learning and AI, that require frequent iteration on
feature stores and real-time serving at global scale.
Client load balancing and failover
In Cassandra, the client controls the load balancing of requests. The client
driver sets a
policy
that's either specified as a part of configuration or programmatically during
session creation. The cluster informs the policy about data centers that are
closest to the application, and the client identifies nodes from those data
centers to service an operation.
The Bigtable service routes API calls to a destination cluster
based on a parameter (an application profile identifier) that's provided with
each operation. Application
profiles
are maintained within the Bigtable service; client operations
that don't select a profile use a default profile.
Bigtable has two types of application profile routing policies:
single-cluster and multi-cluster. A multi-cluster profile routes operations to
the closest available cluster. Clusters in the same region are considered to be
equidistant from the perspective of the operation router. If the node that's
responsible for the requested key range is overloaded or temporarily unavailable
in a cluster, this profile type provides automatic failover.
In terms of Cassandra, a multi-cluster policy provides the failover benefits of
a load balancing policy that's aware of data centers.
An application profile that has single-cluster routing directs all traffic to a
single cluster. Strong row consistency and single-row transactions are only
available in profiles that have single-cluster routing.
The drawback of a single-cluster approach is that in a failover, either the
application must be able to retry by using an alternative application profile
identifier, or you must manually perform the
failover
of impacted, single-cluster routing profiles.
Operation routing
Cassandra and Bigtable use different methods to select the
processing node for read and write operations. In Cassandra, the partition key
is identified, whereas in Bigtable the row key is used.
In Cassandra, the client first inspects the load balancing policy. This
client-side object determines the data center that the operation is routed to.
After the data center is identified, Cassandra contacts a coordinator node to
manage the operation. If the policy recognizes
tokens ,
the coordinator is a node that serves data from the target vnode partition;
otherwise, the coordinator is a random node. The coordinator node identifies the
nodes where the data replicas for the operation partition key are located, and
then it instructs those nodes to perform the operation.
In Bigtable, as discussed earlier, each operation includes an
application profile identifier. The application profile is defined at the
service level. The Bigtable routing layer inspects the profile to
choose the appropriate destination cluster for the operation. The routing layer
then provides a path for the operation to reach the correct processing nodes by
using the row key of the operation.
Data write process
Both databases are optimized for fast writes and use a similar process to
complete a write. However, the steps that the databases take vary slightly,
especially for Cassandra, where, depending on the operation consistency level,
communication with additional participant nodes might be required.
After the write request is routed to the appropriate nodes (Cassandra) or node
(Bigtable), writes are first persisted to disk sequentially in a
commit log (Cassandra) or a shared log (Bigtable). Next, the
writes are inserted into an in-memory table (also known as a memtable ) that's
ordered like the SSTables.
After these two steps, the node responds to indicate that the write is complete.
In Cassandra, several replicas (depending on the consistency level specified for
each operation) must respond before the coordinator informs the client that the
write is complete. In Bigtable, because each row key is only
assigned to a single node at any point in time, a response from the node is all
that's needed to confirm that a write is successful.
Later, if necessary, you can flush the memtable to disk in the form of a new
SSTable. In Cassandra, the flush occurs when the commit log reaches a maximum
size, or when the memtable exceeds a threshold that you configure. In
Bigtable, a flush is initiated to create new
immutable
SSTables when the memtable reaches a maximum size that's specified by the
service. Periodically, a compaction process merges SSTables for a given key
range into a single SSTable.
Data updates
Both databases handle data updates similarly. However, Cassandra allows only one
value for each cell, whereas Bigtable can keep a large number of
versioned values for each cell.
When the value at the intersection of a unique row identifier and column is
modified, the update is persisted as described earlier in the data write
process section. The write timestamp is stored alongside
the value in the SSTable structure.
If you haven't flushed an updated cell to an SSTable, you can store only the
cell value in the memtable, but the databases differ on what's stored. Cassandra
saves only the newest value in the memtable, whereas Bigtable
saves all versions in the memtable.
Alternatively, if you've flushed at least one version of a cell value to disk in
separate SSTables, the databases handle requests for that data differently. When
the cell is requested from Cassandra, only the most recent value according to
the timestamp is returned; in other words, the last write wins. In
Bigtable, you use
filters
to control which versions of cells that a read request returns.
Row deletes
Because both databases use immutable SSTable files to persist data to disk, it
isn't possible to delete a row immediately. To ensure that queries return the
correct results after a row is deleted, both databases handle deletes using the
same mechanism. A marker (called a tombstone in Cassandra) is added first to
the memtable. Eventually, a newly written SSTable contains a timestamped marker
indicating that the unique row identifier is deleted and shouldn't be returned
in query results.
Time to live
The time to live (TTL) capabilities in the two databases are similar except for
one disparity. In Cassandra, you can set the TTL for either a column or table,
whereas in Bigtable, you can only set TTLs for the column family.
A method exists for Bigtable that can simulate cell-level
TTL
.
Garbage collection
Because immediate data updates or deletes aren't possible with immutable
SSTables, as discussed earlier, garbage collection occurs during a process
called a compaction . The process removes cells or rows that shouldn't be
served in query results.
The garbage collection process excludes a row or cell when an SSTable merge
occurs. If a marker or tombstone exists for a row, that row isn't included in
the resultant SSTable. Both databases can exclude a cell from the merged
SSTable. If the cell timestamp exceeds a TTL qualification, the databases
exclude the cell. If there are two timestamped versions for a given cell,
Cassandra only includes the most recent value in the merged SSTable.
Data read path
When a read operation reaches the appropriate processing node, the read process
to obtain data to satisfy a query result is the same for both databases.
For each SSTable on disk that might contain query results, a Bloom
filter
is checked to determine if each file contains rows to be returned. Because Bloom
filters never provide a false negative, all the qualifying
SSTables are added to a candidate list to be included in further read result
processing.
The read operation is performed using a merged view created from the memtable
and the candidate SSTables on disk. Because all keys are lexicographically
sorted, it's efficient to obtain a merged view that's scanned to obtain query
results.
In Cassandra, a set of processing nodes that are determined by the operation
consistency level must participate in the operation. In Bigtable,
only the node responsible for the key range needs to be consulted. For
Cassandra, you need to consider the implications for compute sizing because it's
likely that multiple nodes will process each read.
Read results can be limited at the processing node in slightly different ways.
In Cassandra, the WHERE clause in a CQL query restricts the rows returned. The
constraint is that columns in the primary key or columns included in a secondary
index might be used to limit results.
Bigtable offers a rich filter assortment of
filters
that affect the rows or cells that a read query retrieves.
There are three categories of filters:
Limiting filters, which control the rows or cells that the response
includes.
Modifying filters, which affect the data or metadata for individual cells.
Composing filters, which let you combine multiple filters into one filter.
Limiting filters are the most commonly used—for example, the column
family regular
expression
and column qualifier regular
expression
.
Physical data storage
Bigtable and Cassandra both store data in SSTables, which are
regularly merged during a compaction phase. SSTable data compression offers
similar benefits for reducing storage size. However, compression is applied
automatically in Bigtable and is a configuration option in
Cassandra.
When comparing the two databases, you should understand how each database
physically stores data differently in the following aspects:
The data distribution strategy
The number of cell versions available
The storage disk type
The data durability and replication mechanism
Data distribution
In Cassandra, a consistent hash of the primary key's partition columns is the
recommended method of determining data distribution across the various SSTables
served by cluster nodes.
Bigtable uses a variable prefix to the full row key in order to
lexicographically place data in SSTables.
Cell versions
Cassandra keeps only one active cell value version. If two writes are made to a
cell, a last-write-wins policy ensures that only one value is returned.
Bigtable doesn't limit the number of timestamped versions for
each cell. Other row size
limits
might apply. If not set by the client
request ,
the timestamp is determined by the Bigtable service at the moment
that the processing node receives the mutation. Cell versions can be pruned
using a garbage collection policy that can be different for each table's column
family, or can be filtered from a query result set through the API.
Disk storage
Cassandra stores SSTables on disks that are attached to each cluster node. To
rebalance data in Cassandra, the files must be physically copied between
servers.
Bigtable uses Colossus to store SSTables. Because
Bigtable uses this distributed file system, it's possible for the
Bigtable service to almost instantly reassign SSTables to
different nodes.
Data durability and replication
Cassandra delivers data durability through the replication factor setting. The
replication factor determines the number of SSTable copies that are stored on
different nodes in the cluster. A typical setting for the replication factor is
3 , which still allows stronger consistency guarantees with QUORUM or
LOCAL_QUORUM even if a node failure occurs.
With Bigtable, high data-durability guarantees are provided
through the replication that Colossus provides.
The following diagram illustrates the physical data layout, compute processing
nodes, and routing layer for Bigtable:
Figure 5 : Architecture for data replication
includes a frontend, Bigtable clusters, and Colossus.
In the Colossus storage layer, each node is assigned to serve the data that's
stored in a series of SSTables. Those SSTables contain the data for the row key
ranges that are dynamically assigned to each node. While the diagram shows three
SSTables for each node, it's likely there are more because SSTables are
continually created as the nodes receive new changes to data.
Each node has a shared log.
Writes
processed by each node are immediately persisted to the shared log before the
client receives a write acknowledgment. Because a write to Colossus is
replicated multiple times, the durability is ensured even if nodal hardware
failure occurs before the data is persisted to an SSTable for the row range.
Application interfaces
Originally, Cassandra database access was exposed through a
Thrift
API, but this method of access is deprecated. The recommended client interaction
is through CQL.
Similar to Cassandra's original Thrift API, Bigtable database
access is provided through an API that reads and writes data based on the
provided row keys.
Like Cassandra, Bigtable has both a command-line interface,
called the
cbt CLI
, and client libraries that support many common
programming languages. These libraries are built on top of the gRPC and REST
APIs. Applications that are written for Hadoop and rely on the open source
Apache HBase library for Java can connect without significant
change
to Bigtable. For applications that don't require HBase
compatibility, we recommend that you use the built-in Bigtable
Java client.
Bigtable's Identity and Access Management (IAM)
controls
are fully integrated with Google Cloud, and tables can also be used as an
external data
source
from BigQuery.
Database setup
When you set up a Cassandra cluster, you have several configuration decisions to
make and steps to complete. First, you must configure your server nodes to
provide compute capacity and provision local storage. When you use a replication
factor of three, the recommended and most common setting, you must provision
storage to store three times the amount of data that you expect to hold in your
cluster. You must also determine and set configurations for vnodes, racks, and
replication.
The separation of compute from storage in Bigtable simplifies
scaling clusters up and down as compared to Cassandra. In a normally running
cluster, you are typically only concerned with the total storage used by the
managed tables, which determines the minimum number of nodes, and having enough
nodes to keep up the current QPS.
You can quickly adjust the Bigtable cluster size if the cluster
is over- or under-provisioned based on production load.
Bigtable storage
Other than the geographic location of the initial cluster, the only choice that
you need to make when you create your Bigtable instance is the
storage type. Bigtable offers two options for storage:
solid-state drives (SSD) or hard disk drives (HDD). All clusters in an instance
must share the same storage type.
When you account for storage needs with Bigtable, you don't need
to account for storage replicas as you would when sizing a Cassandra cluster.
There's no loss of storage density to achieve fault tolerance as is seen in
Cassandra. Furthermore, because storage doesn't need to be expressly
provisioned, you're only charged for the storage in use.
SSD
The SSD node's capacity of 5 TB, which is preferred for most workloads,
provides higher storage density in comparison with the recommended configuration
for Cassandra machines, which have a practical maximum storage density of less
than 2 TB for each node. When you assess storage capacity needs, remember
that Bigtable only counts one copy of the data; by comparison,
Cassandra needs to account for three copies of the data under most
configurations.
While write QPS for SSD is about the same as HDD, SSD provides significantly
higher read QPS than HDD. SSD storage is priced at or near the costs of
provisioned SSD persistent
disks
and varies by region.
HDD
The HDD storage type allows for considerable storage density—16 TB
for each node. The trade-off is that random reads are significantly slower,
supporting only 500 rows
read
per second for each node. HDD is preferred for write-intensive workloads where
reads are expected to be range scans associated with batch processing. HDD
storage is priced at or near the cost associated with Cloud Storage and
varies by region.
Cluster size considerations
When you size a Bigtable instance to prepare for migrating a
Cassandra workload, there are considerations when you compare single-data center
Cassandra clusters to single-cluster Bigtable instances, and
Cassandra multiple-data center clusters to multi-cluster Bigtable
instances. The guidelines in the following sections assume that no significant
data model changes are needed to migrate, and that there's equivalent storage
compression between Cassandra and Bigtable.
A single-data center cluster
When you compare a single-data center cluster to a single-cluster
Bigtable instance, you should first consider the storage
requirements. You can estimate the unreplicated size of each keyspace by using
the nodetool tablestats
command
and dividing the total, flushed storage size by the keyspace's replication
factor. Then, you divide the unreplicated storage amount of all keyspaces by
3.5 TB ( 5 TB *
.70
) to determine the suggested number of SSD nodes to handle the storage alone. As
discussed, Bigtable handles storage replication and durability
within a separate tier that's transparent to the user.
Next, you should consider the compute requirements for the number of nodes. You
can consult Cassandra server and client application metrics to get an
approximate number of sustained reads and writes that have been executed. To
estimate the minimum number of SSD nodes to perform your workload, divide that
metric by 10,000. You likely need more nodes for applications that require
low-latency query
results
. Google recommends that you test the performance of Bigtable
with representative data and queries to establish a metric for the per-node QPS
that's achievable for your workload.
The number of nodes that's required for the cluster should be equal to the
larger of the storage and compute needs. If you're in doubt about your storage
or throughput needs, you can match up the number of Bigtable
nodes with the number of typical Cassandra
machines .
You can scale a Bigtable cluster up or down to match workload
needs with minimal effort and zero downtime.
A multiple-data center cluster
With multiple-data center clusters, it's more difficult to determine the
configuration of a Bigtable instance. Ideally, you should have a
cluster in the instance for every data center in the Cassandra topology. Each
Bigtable cluster in the instance must store all data within the
instance and must be able to handle the total insert rate across the entire
cluster. Clusters in an instance can be created in any supported cloud region
across the globe.
The technique for estimating storage needs is similar to the approach for
single-data center clusters. You use nodetool to capture the storage size of
each keyspace in the Cassandra cluster and then divide that size by the number
of replicas. You need to remember that a table's keyspace might have different
replication factors for each data center.
The number of nodes in each cluster in an instance should be able to handle all
writes across the cluster and all reads to at least two data centers in order to
maintain service level objectives
(SLOs)
during a cluster outage. A common approach is to start with all clusters having
the equivalent node capacity of the busiest data center in the Cassandra
cluster. Bigtable clusters in an instance can be individually
scaled up or down to match workload needs with zero downtime.
Administration
Bigtable provides fully managed components for common
administration functions performed in Cassandra.
Backup and restore
Bigtable provides two methods to cover common backup needs:
Bigtable
backups
and managed data exports.
You can think of Bigtable backups as analogous to a managed
version of Cassandra's nodetool snapshot feature. Bigtable
backups create restorable copies of a table, which are stored as member objects
of a cluster. You can restore backups as a new table in the cluster that
initiated the backup. The backups are designed to create restore points if
application-level corruption occurs. Backups that you create through this
utility don't consume node resources and are priced at or near
Cloud Storage prices. You can invoke Bigtable backups
programmatically or through the Google Cloud console for Bigtable.
Another way you can back up Bigtable is to use a managed data
export to Cloud Storage. You can export into the Avro, Parquet, or
Hadoop Sequence file formats. Compared to Bigtable backups,
exports take longer to execute and incur extra compute costs because the exports
use Dataflow. However, these exports create portable data files that
you can query offline or import into another system.
Resizing
Because Bigtable separates storage and compute, you can add or
remove Bigtable nodes in response to query demand more seamlessly
than you can in Cassandra. Cassandra's homogeneous architecture requires you to
rebalance nodes (or vnodes) across the machines in the cluster.
You can change the cluster size manually in the Google Cloud console or
programmatically using the Cloud Bigtable API. Adding nodes to a cluster can
yield noticeable performance improvements within minutes. Some customers have
successfully used an open source autoscaler developed by
Spotify
.
Internal maintenance
The Bigtable service seamlessly handles common Cassandra internal
maintenance tasks such as OS patching, node recovery, node repair, storage
compaction monitoring, and SSL certificate rotation.
Monitoring
Connecting Bigtable to metrics visualization or alerting doesn't
require administration or development effort. The Bigtable
Google Cloud console page comes with prebuilt dashboards for tracking
throughput and utilization metrics at the instance, cluster, and table levels.
Custom views and alerts can be created in the
Cloud Monitoring
dashboards, where metrics are automatically available.
The Bigtable
Key
Visualizer
, a monitoring feature in the Google Cloud console, lets you perform advanced
performance tuning.
IAM and security
In Bigtable, authorization is fully integrated into
Google Cloud's IAM
framework
and requires minimal setup and maintenance. Local user accounts and passwords
are not shared with client applications; instead, granular permissions and
roles
are granted to organization-level users and service
accounts
.
Bigtable automatically encrypts all data at rest and in transit.
There are no options to disable these features. All administrative access is
fully
logged
. You can use
VPC Service Controls
to control access to Bigtable instances from outside of approved
networks.
