Create a cluster
This page explains how to create a cluster and node pool in
GKE on Azure on Kubernetes version 1.34.1-gke.4700.
Before you begin
To complete the steps on this page, do the following:
Follow the steps in
Configure prerequisites .
Choose if you will run the control plane in multiple zones
or a single zone.
Select classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) ranges to provide to your
cluster.
Control plane zonal placement
By default, GKE on Azure places separate control plane replicas in the
same subnet across three zones in your selected region. You can choose these
zones and subnets.
If you want to use the default control plane replica placement, skip to
Select CIDR ranges for your cluster .
Azure NAT gateway and cluster control planes
Each control plane replica also requires connectivity to the Google-hosted
management service to operate in a normal state.
If you use Azure NAT gateway to provide outbound connectivity, you must consider
how a zonal failure impacts the cluster's control plane. One NAT gateway
endpoint is isolated to a single zone or is regional/non-zonal, and this
presents a single point of failure.
If you want to place control plane replicas in a single zone, use a
single subnet and zone. If you use NAT Gateway for outbound connectivity, make
sure that the endpoint is placed in the same zone.
If you want to place replicas in two or three zones, you can pass a list of
subnets and zones when you create a cluster. When you pass two subnets and zones,
GKE on Azure places two replicas in the first zone provided. When
you pass in three subnets and zones, GKE on Azure places replicas in
each subnet. For more information, see
Place replicas in a specific subnet .
For more information on configuring Azure subnets and zones for high
availability, see
Zone isolation with zonal stacks
in the Azure documentation.
Place replicas in a specific subnet
This section is optional.
To control which zones control plane replicas are placed in, you use the
--replica-placements
flag and pass a list of subnet IDs and zones when you create your
cluster. You can use up to three subnets and zones where to place the
control plane replicas.
To format the list of subnets, perform the following steps.
Retrieve your Azure subnet IDs with the az command-line tool:
az network vnet subnet show \
--resource-group = VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --vnet-name = VNET_NAME \
--name SUBNET_NAME --query "id" -otsv
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME : an existing resource group
name where you want to run your cluster
VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME : the resource group name that
holds your VNet
VNET_NAME : your VNet name
SUBNET_NAME : your subnet name
The output is the ID of the subnet. Azure subnet IDs look like the following:
/subscriptions/ SUBSCRIPTION_ID /resourceGroups/ RESOURCE_GROUP /providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/ VNET_NAME /subnets/ SUBNET_NAME
Repeat this command for each subnet where you would like to create a control
plane replica in. Copy the subnet IDs into a text editor for the following
step.
Create a comma-separated list of subnet IDs and Azure availability zones,
with a colon separating the subnet and zone.
For example, to create control plane replicas in subnet1 in zone 1,
subnet2 in zone 2, and subnet3 in zone 3, you use the following string:
/subscriptions/ SUBSCRIPTION_ID /resourceGroups/ RESOURCE_GROUP /providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/ VNET_NAME /subnets/subnet1:1,/subscriptions/ SUBSCRIPTION_ID /resourceGroups/ RESOURCE_GROUP /providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/ VNET_NAME /subnets/subnet2:2,/subscriptions/ SUBSCRIPTION_ID /resourceGroups/ RESOURCE_GROUP /providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/ VNET_NAME /subnets/subnet3:3
Copy this string and use it as the value for the --replica-placements flag
when you create a cluster .
Select CIDR ranges for your cluster
When you create a cluster in GKE on Azure, you need to provide
IPv4 address ranges to use for Pods and Services.
These IP ranges are specified using Classless Inter-Domain Routing
( CIDR )
notation—for example, 100.64.0.0/16 .
Note: After you create a cluster, you can't change these ranges.
Recommended ranges
We recommend the following CIDR ranges for Services and Pods:
Services: 100.64.0.0/16
Pods: 100.96.0.0/11
These ranges are large enough for you to grow your cluster without any issues.
The following sections provide more details.
Details about selecting ranges
GKE on Azure uses an overlay network for Pods and Services, so the IP ranges for
these networks don't need to be routable within the VNet. Any IP
ranges that you use must be guaranteed available. For more information, see
Dataplane V2 .
The Pod and Service IP ranges can overlap with the VNet network,
provided either doesn't include the control plane or node pool subnet
IP ranges.
The Pod and Service IP range must fall within one of the following private IP ranges:
10.0.0.0/8 , 172.16.0.0/12 , 192.168.0.0/16 — Private IP addresses (RFC 1918)
100.64.0.0/10 — Shared address space (RFC 6598)
192.0.0.0/24 — IETF protocol assignments (RFC 6890)
192.0.2.0/24 , 198.51.100.0/24 , 203.0.113.0/24 — Documentation (RFC 5737)
192.88.99.0/24 — IPv6 to IPv4 relay (deprecated) (RFC 7526)
198.18.0.0/15 — Benchmark testing (RFC 2544)
We recommend IP ranges within 100.64.0.0/10 (RFC 6598). This range
is reserved for carrier-grade NAT, which is likely not used in your
VNet.
For example, the following is a valid configuration where the Pod, Service, and
Node networks don't overlap (the VNet is using RFC 1918 private IP
addresses, whereas the Pod and Service networks are overlaid onto RFC 6598
private IPs).
VNet network: 10.0.0.0/16 , 172.16.1.0/24 , 172.16.2.0/24
Pod network: 100.65.0.0/16
Service network: 100.66.0.0/16
The following is also a valid configuration despite the Pod and Service networks
overlap with the VNet network since there is no overlap with
the control plane replicas.
VNet network: 10.0.0.0/16
Pod network: 10.0.1.0/24
Service network: 10.0.2.0/24
Control Plane Replica subnets: 10.0.3.0/24 , 10.0.4.0/24 , 10.0.5.0/24
The following configuration is invalid , because the Pod IP range
overlaps with the control plane network. This overlap might prevent
workloads from communicating with the control plane replica in the VNet network:
VNet network: 10.0.0.0/16
Pod network: 10.0.1.0/24
Service network: 10.1.0.0/24
Control Plane Replica subnets: 10.0.1.0/24 , 10.0.2.0/24 , 10.0.3.0/24
Details about the Pod address range
Kubernetes allocates addresses to
Pod
objects from the Pod address range. A cluster's Pod range is split into smaller
ranges for each node. When a Pod is scheduled on a particular node, Kubernetes
assigns a Pod IP address from the node's range.
To calculate the size of the Pod address range, you need to estimate the
number of nodes that you want in your cluster and the number of Pods that you
want to run on each node.
The following table provides size recommendations for Pod CIDR ranges based on
the number of nodes and Pods that you intend to run.

Details about the service address range
Kubernetes allocates virtual IP addresses for
Service objects — for example,
load balancers from this address range.
To calculate the size of the Service address range, you need to estimate the
number of services that you want in your cluster.

Authenticate to Azure
GKE on Azure provides two methods of authenticating to Azure:
workload identity federation
and creating a client certificate .
Workload identity federation authentication is the recommended method, because
it's simpler and more secure.
Workload identity federation
Workload identify federation allows GKE on Azure to authenticate to
Azure using a Google service account, in order to subsequently manage resources
in the Azure AD application. Compared to AzureClient, you don't need to
manage certificates and upload to Azure AD manually.
To configure a federated identity credential on your Azure AD
application, run the following commands. Note that you can add up to twenty
credentials to each Azure AD application.
Save your Azure application ID to environment variables:
APPLICATION_ID = $( az ad app list --all \
--query "[?displayName==' APPLICATION_NAME '].appId" --output tsv )
PROJECT_ID = " $( gcloud config get-value project ) "
PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects describe " $PROJECT_ID " \
--format "value(projectNumber)" )
APPLICATION_NAME : the Azure AD application name that
you used when you Create an Azure Active Directory Application .
Create a JSON file named credential.json .
{
"name": " CREDENTIAL_NAME ",
"issuer": "https://accounts.google.com",
"subject": "service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-gkemulticloud.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
"audiences": ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"],
"description": "Allow GKE on Azure to authenticate to the Azure AD application using a Google service account."
}
CREDENTIAL_NAME : the credential name.
PROJECT_NUMBER : the number of the Google Cloud project that
hosts the cluster.
Create a federated identity credential on the Azure AD application:
az ad app federated-credential create --id " ${ APPLICATION_ID } " --parameters credential.json
For more details, see the Azure documentation
Azure AD workload identity federation with Google Cloud .
You can also provision the Azure federated identity credential using Terraform.
For details, see azuread_application_federated_identity_credential .
After you configure the credentials, create or select an SSH key pair for your cluster.
Create an ssh key pair
When you create a cluster, you need to provide an SSH key pair. If you already
have a key pair to use, skip this step.
To create a new key pair, use the ssh-keygen command-line tool:
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -f KEY_PATH
Replace KEY_PATH with the path to your new private key.
Store the key in an environment variable:
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY = $( cat KEY_PATH .pub )
For example, to create a new key pair at ~/.ssh/anthos-multicloud-key.pub
and store the public key in an environment variable, run the following
command:
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/anthos-multicloud-key
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY = $( cat ~/.ssh/anthos-multicloud-key.pub )
After you save the public key to an environment variable, you are ready to
create a cluster.
Select your Fleet host project
Fleets are a
Google Cloud concept to organize clusters into larger groups.
With fleets, you can manage multiple clusters across several clouds and apply
consistent policies across them. The GKE Multi-Cloud API automatically registers your
clusters with a Fleet when the cluster is created.
When you create a cluster, you specify a
Fleet host project
where the cluster will be managed from. Because GKE on Azure uses the
cluster name as the Fleet membership name, you must ensure that your cluster
names are unique across your Fleet.
Note: Once a cluster has been created, you cannot change its Fleet host project.
Cross-project registration
If you want to use a Fleet Host project other than the Google Cloud project
where the cluster is located, you must apply an additional IAM
policy binding to the Multi-Cloud Service Agent service account. This allows the
service account to manage Fleets with the Fleet Host Project.
To add the Service Agent to your project, run this command:
gcloud beta services identity create --service = gkemulticloud.googleapis.com \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER
Replace CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER with your Google Cloud project
number.
Assign this binding with the following command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-gkemulticloud.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/gkemulticloud.serviceAgent"
Replace the following:
FLEET_PROJECT_ID : your Fleet host project's
Google Cloud project
CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER : your Google Cloud project
number
The Multi-Cloud Service Agent account name has the following format:
service-CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-gkemulticloud.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
You can find your service accounts on the Google Cloud console
Service account page. For more
information on how to find your project number, see
Identifying projects .
Create a cluster
To create a cluster, run the following commands:
Save your Azure resource group, VNet, and subnet IDs to environment
variables:
SUBSCRIPTION_ID = $( az account show --query "id" --output tsv )
TENANT_ID = $( az account list \
--query "[?id==' ${ SUBSCRIPTION_ID } '].{tenantId:tenantId}" --output tsv )
CLUSTER_RG_ID = $( az group show --resource-group = CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--query "id" -otsv )
VNET_ID = $( az network vnet show --resource-group = VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--name = VNET_NAME --query "id" -otsv )
SUBNET_ID = $( az network vnet subnet show \
--resource-group = VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --vnet-name = VNET_NAME \
--name default --query "id" -otsv )
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME : an existing resource group
name where you want to run your cluster
VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME : the resource group name that
holds your VNet
VNET_NAME : the name of your VNet
Create a cluster with the Google Cloud CLI:
Workload identity federation
gcloud container azure clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
--fleet-project FLEET_PROJECT \
--azure-tenant-id " ${ TENANT_ID } " \
--azure-application-id " ${ APPLICATION_ID } " \
--azure-region AZURE_REGION \
--pod-address-cidr-blocks POD_CIDR \
--service-address-cidr-blocks SERVICE_CIDR \
--vm-size VM_SIZE \
--cluster-version 1 .34.1-gke.4700 \
--ssh-public-key " $SSH_PUBLIC_KEY " \
--resource-group-id " $CLUSTER_RG_ID " \
--vnet-id " $VNET_ID " \
--subnet-id " $SUBNET_ID " # Optional, see following note \
--tags "control-plane= CLUSTER_NAME " \
--admin-users ADMIN_USERS_LIST
Azure client
gcloud container azure clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
--fleet-project FLEET_PROJECT \
--client CLIENT_NAME \
--azure-region AZURE_REGION \
--pod-address-cidr-blocks POD_CIDR \
--service-address-cidr-blocks SERVICE_CIDR \
--vm-size VM_SIZE \
--cluster-version 1 .34.1-gke.4700 \
--ssh-public-key " $SSH_PUBLIC_KEY " \
--resource-group-id " $CLUSTER_RG_ID " \
--vnet-id " $VNET_ID " \
--subnet-id " $SUBNET_ID " # Optional, see following note \
--tags "control-plane= CLUSTER_NAME " \
--admin-users ADMIN_USERS_LIST
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your cluster
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION : the Google Cloud location
that manages your cluster
FLEET_PROJECT with the
fleet host project where the
cluster will be registered. If you want to manage this cluster from another
Google Cloud project, see
Cross-project registration .
AZURE_REGION : a
supported Azure region
associated to your Google Cloud region
POD_CIDR : your cluster's Pod address range —
for example, 10.0.1.0/18
SERVICE_CIDR : your cluster's
Service address range
VM_SIZE : a
supported Azure VM size
ADMIN_USERS_LIST (optional): a comma-separated list of
email addresses of the users to grant administrative privileges to - for example,
"kai@example.com,hao@example.com,kalani@example.com".
Defaults to the user creating the cluster
CLIENT_NAME : your AzureClient
name
Note: When you create a cluster, you can pass the
following three optional fields instead of the `--subnet-id` field:
--endpoint-subnet-id : the subnet where GKE on Azure deploys
the control plane load balancer endpoint. If you don't specify a value,
the default is `subnet-id`.
--service-load-balancer-subnet-id : the subnet where Kubernetes private
Service-type load balancers are deployed. If you don't specify a value, the
default is `subnet-id`.
--replica-placements
Check the status of your cluster:
gcloud container azure clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME --location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
The output includes information about the status and configuration of your
cluster.
Authorize Cloud Logging / Cloud Monitoring
Note: Starting with Kubernetes version 1.28, manual policy binding to
authorize the gke-system/gke-telemetry-agent service account for log and
metric collection is no longer necessary. The required permissions are now
automatically granted to this service account. You can therefore disregard
this section.
In order for GKE on Azure to create and upload system logs and metrics to
Google Cloud, it must be authorized.
To authorize the Kubernetes workload identity gke-system/gke-telemetry-agent
to write logs to Google Cloud Logging, and metrics to Google Cloud Monitoring,
run this command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID \
--member = "serviceAccount: GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog[gke-system/gke-telemetry-agent]" \
--role = roles/gkemulticloud.telemetryWriter
Replace GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID with the cluster's Google Cloud project ID.
This IAM binding grants access for all clusters in the Google Cloud project project to
upload logs and metrics. You only need to run it after creating your
first cluster for the project.
Adding this IAM binding will fail unless at least one cluster has been
created in your Google Cloud project. This is because the workload identity pool
it refers to ( GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog ) is
not provisioned until cluster creation.
Create a node pool
Before you create a node pool, you need the following:
Permissions to use the az command-line tool to retrieve an Azure subnet ID.
Access to the cluster's SSH public key.
To create a node pool, run the following commands:
Save your Azure VNet subnet ID and SSH public key to environment variables:
SUBNET_ID = $( az network vnet subnet show \
--resource-group = VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --vnet-name = VNET_NAME \
--name default --query "id" -otsv )
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY = $( cat KEY_PATH .pub )
Replace the following:
VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME : the resource group name that
holds VNet
VNET_NAME : the name of your VNet
KEY_PATH : the path to your key pair
Create a node pool with the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud container azure node-pools create NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
--node-version 1 .34.1-gke.4700 \
--vm-size VM_SIZE \
--max-pods-per-node 110 \
--min-nodes MIN_NODES \
--max-nodes MAX_NODES \
--ssh-public-key " ${ SSH_PUBLIC_KEY } " \
--subnet-id " ${ SUBNET_ID } "
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : a unique name for your node pool—for
example, node-pool-1
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your GKE on Azure
cluster
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION : the
Google Cloud location
that manages your cluster
VM_SIZE : a
supported Azure VM size
MIN_NODES : the minimum number of nodes in the node
pool—for more information, see
Cluster autoscaler
MAX_NODES : the maximum number of nodes in the node pool
Check the status of your node pool:
gcloud container azure node-pools describe NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : a unique name for your node pool—for
example, node-pool-1
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your GKE on Azure
cluster
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION : the
Google Cloud location
that manages your cluster
The output includes the status of your node pool, including if it is
PROVISIONING or RUNNING .
