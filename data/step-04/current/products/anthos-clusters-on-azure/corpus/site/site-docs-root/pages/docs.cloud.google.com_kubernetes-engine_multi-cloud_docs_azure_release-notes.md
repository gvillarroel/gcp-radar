Feature
1.27
GA: Enabled node auto repair. This feature continuously monitors the health of each node in a node pool.
Added support for a new admin-groups flag in the create and update APIs. This flag allows customers to quickly and easily authenticate listed groups as cluster administrators, eliminating the need to manually create and apply RBAC policies.
Upgraded the snapshot-controller and csi-snapshot-validation-webhook to v6.2.2. This new version introduces an important change to the API. Specifically, the VolumeSnapshot , VolumeSnapshotContents , and VolumeSnapshotClass v1beta1 APIs are no longer available.
Disabled the unauthenticated kubelet read-only port 10255. Once a node pool is upgraded to version 1.27, workloads running on it will no longer be able to connect to port 10255.
Enabled gzip compression for fluent-bit 's ingestion of logs into Cloud Logging. This improves the efficiency of log transfer for both the control plane and workloads.
Optimized audit-proxy 's audit logging ingestion by enabling gzip compression.
Improved security by adding file-integrity checks and fingerprint validation for Google-managed binary artifacts downloaded from Cloud Storage.
Added support for automatic periodic defragmentation of etcd and etcd-events on the control plane. This feature reduces unnecessary disk storage and helps to prevent etcd and the control plane from becoming unavailable due to disk storage issues.
Changed the metrics names for Kubernetes resource metrics to use a metrics prefix of kubernetes.io/anthos/ rather than kubernetes.io/ . For details refer to the metrics reference documentation.
Changed default etcd version to v3.4.21 on new clusters for improved stability. Existing clusters upgraded to this version will use etcd v3.5.6.
Improved node resource management by reserving resources for the kubelet. While this feature is crucial for preventing Out of Memory (OOM) errors by ensuring system and Kubernetes processes have the resources they need, it may lead to workload disruptions. The reservation of resources for the kubelet may affect the available resources for Pods, potentially affecting the capacity of smaller nodes to handle existing workloads. Customers should verify that smaller nodes can still support their workloads with this new feature activated.
The reserved memory percentages are as follows:
255 MiB for machines with less than 1GB of memory
25% of the first 4GB of memory
20% of the next 4GB
10% of the next 8GB
6% of the next 112GB
2% of any memory above 128GB
The reserved CPU percentages are as follows:
6% of the first core
1% of the next core
0.5% of the next 2 cores
0.25% of any cores above 4 cores
Feature
1.25
Expanded the list of metrics collected from node pools to include gke-metrics-agent , cilium-agent , cilium-operator , coredns , fluentbit-gke , kubelet , and konnectivity-agent .

Announcement
Anthos Multi-Cloud is disabling the unauthenticated kubelet read-only port 10255 for node pools in our next minor release with Kubernetes v1.27. This port is unauthenticated, which means potentially sensitive information passed via this port over HTTP is accessible. Once a node pool is upgraded to version 1.27, workloads running on it will no longer be able to connect to port 10255.
To determine if you have dependencies on this port, check the metrics in a Kubernetes v1.26 cluster that is running Kubernetes v1.26 node pools.
If you have dependencies on this port, perform the following steps:
Update the workload to access https:// :10250 instead of http:// :10255.
Authenticate to kubelet using a service account.
Widen the RBAC rules so that this service account has sufficient permissions to request the needed kubelet APIs.
Note that popular third-party products should already support kubelet authentication, and may require no action beyond upgrade.
If you have a cluster which has dependencies on the read-only port 10255 and you aren't able to migrate, please reach out to the Anthos Multi-Cloud team.

Feature
Starting from Kubernetes version 1.24, virtual machines launched by Anthos clusters on Azure support System Assigned Managed Identities.
Feature
In Kubernetes version 1.24 and later, Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus (GMP) is available as an invite only private preview. GMP lets you monitor and alert on workloads, using Prometheus, without having to manually manage and operate Prometheus at scale.
Change
Starting from Kubernetes version 1.24, Anthos clusters on Azure switches to the external cloud provider. To learn more about this provider, see Cloud provider for Azure on GitHub.
Fixed
In Kubernetes version 1.24 and later, there are now checks to the API to ensure that users aren't making inconsistent or erroneous requests.
Breaking
Go 1.18 stops accepting certificates signed with the SHA-1 hash algorithm by default. Admission and conversion webhooks or aggregated server endpoints using these insecure certificates will break by default starting from Kubertnetes version 1.24.
The environment variable GODEBUG=x509sha1=1 is set in Anthos on AWS clusters as a temporary workaround to let these insecure certificates continue to work. However, the Go team is anticipated to remove support on this workaround. You should check and ensure there aren't any admission or conversion webhooks or aggregated server endpoints that are using such insecure certificates before upgrading to the upcoming breaking version.

Announcement
Anthos on Azure is now generally available through the Multi-Cloud API.
With the latest release, we've simplified installation and streamlined our cluster management technology. You can now use a single API for full lifecycle management of Anthos clusters running in AWS or Azure. This release introduces gcloud command groups for deploying Anthos clusters in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Clusters you create in other clouds appear in the Google Cloud Console, creating a centralized management view complete with cluster telemetry and logging.
The Multi-Cloud API authenticates with each cloud using a service account or application registration, and allows clusters to be deployed on existing or newly created VNets. It supports multiple machine types in each cloud across multiple regions . As a reminder, Anthos clusters on Azure or AWS integrate with each respective cloud's KMS, storage facilities, and load balancing.
Anthos on Azure is available today, with either subscription or pay-as-you-go pricing .
