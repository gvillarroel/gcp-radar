Deploy an application on GKE on Azure
This page describes how to create a cluster and node pool, and then deploy a
sample application using GKE on Azure.
Terraform support
If you're familiar with Terraform, you can use the
Terraform scripts available on GitHub
to automate the prerequisites and create a cluster.
Before you begin
Before creating a cluster, you must complete the
prerequisites . In particular, you must
provide the following resources:
An Azure virtual network where the cluster will run.
A subnet for the Kubernetes control plane replicas.
Azure role assignments that will grant GKE on Azure access to your
Azure environment using a service principal.
A AzureClient resource that GKE on Azure uses to authenticate
to Azure services and manage resources in your Azure account.
An SSH key pair for accessing Azure virtual machines in the cluster.
It is your responsibility to create and manage these resources, which can be
shared between all your clusters. All other underlying Azure resources for your
cluster are managed by GKE on Azure.
Set default settings for the gcloud CLI
Use the gcloud CLI to configure default settings for your
default project and Google Cloud region.
Your project has a project ID as a unique identifier. When you create a
project, you can use the automatically generated project ID or you can create
your own.
Your Google Cloud region is a location where your clusters will be managed
from. For example, us-west1 . See
Management regions for more details.
When you configure these default settings, you don't need to include them when
you run the Google Cloud CLI. You can also specify settings or override default
settings by passing the --project and --location flags to the
Google Cloud CLI.
When you create GKE on Azure resources after configuring your default
project and location, the resources are automatically created in that project
and location.
Note: The gcloud CLI might return an error if these settings are
either not configured or not specified.
To set defaults, follow these steps:
Set the default project:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Set the default management location:
gcloud config set container_azure/location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
Replace GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION with your location,
such as us-west1 .
Note: the container_azure/location property was previously named
azure/location . If you have previously set the property azure/location , its
value is copied to container_azure/location next time you
run a command.
Select Azure resource IDs for your cluster
Select a resource group ID
Save your cluster's resource group to an environment variable
running the following command:
CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP_ID = $( az group show --query id --output tsv \
--resource-group = CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME )
Replace CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of
the resource group to provision your cluster resources in, that you set up in the
Create an Azure resource group
prerequisite step.
Select a virtual network ID
Save your cluster's VNet ID to an environment variable by running the following
command:
VNET_ID = $( az network vnet show --query id --output tsv \
--resource-group = VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--name = VNET_NAME )
Replace the following:
VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of the resource group
that contains your virtual network, as set up in the
Create an Azure virtual network
prerequisite step.
VNET_NAME with the name of your virtual network, as set up in the
Create an Azure virtual network
prerequisite step.
Select a subnet ID
Save your cluster's subnet ID to an environment variable by running the following command:
SUBNET_ID = $( az network vnet subnet show --query id --output tsv \
--resource-group VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--vnet-name VNET_NAME \
--name SUBNET_NAME )
Replace:
VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with an existing resource group
name that contains your virtual network. This can be the resource group name
that you set up in
Create an Azure virtual network .
VNET_NAME with the name of your virtual network. This can
be the name of your virtual network that you set up in
Create an Azure virtual network .
SUBNET_NAME with the name of your subnet— for
example, default .
Select CIDR ranges for your cluster
Kubernetes requires two CIDR ranges to be provided for the cluster. These CIDR
ranges should be chosen so that they do not overlap with CIDR ranges used by
your VPC subnets. They should be large enough for the maximum expected size of
your cluster.
Pod address CIDR range : When a new Pod is created, it is allocated an IP
address from this range. Example range: 192.168.208.0/20
Service address CIDR range : When a new Service is created, it is
allocated an IP address from this range. Example range: 192.168.224.0/20
Create a cluster
Use the following command to create a cluster under GKE on Azure.
gcloud container azure clusters create azure-cluster-0 \
--cluster-version 1 .34.1-gke.4700 \
--azure-region AZURE_REGION \
--fleet-project FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
--client CLIENT_NAME \
--resource-group-id $CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP_ID \
--vnet-id $VNET_ID \
--subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \
--pod-address-cidr-blocks POD_CIDR_BLOCK \
--service-address-cidr-blocks SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK \
--ssh-public-key " SSH_PUBLIC_KEY " \
--tags "google:gkemulticloud:cluster=azure-cluster-0"
Replace:
AZURE_REGION : a
supported Azure region
associated to your Google Cloud region
FLEET_PROJECT_ID with the
fleet host project ID where the
cluster will be registered.
CLIENT_NAME : your AzureClient
name.
POD_CIDR_BLOCK : your cluster's Pod address range
SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK : your cluster's
Service address range
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY with the text of your SSH public key as
created in the
Create an SSH key pair
prerequisite step. If you saved your public key to an environment variable in
that step, you can use ${SSH_PUBLIC_KEY} .
For more information and optional parameters, see the
gcloud container azure clusters create
reference page.
Create a node pool
Create a node pool with the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud container azure node-pools create pool-0 \
--cluster azure-cluster-0 \
--node-version 1 .34.1-gke.4700 \
--vm-size Standard_B2s \
--max-pods-per-node 110 \
--min-nodes 1 \
--max-nodes 5 \
--ssh-public-key " SSH_PUBLIC_KEY " \
--subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \
--tags "google:gkemulticloud:cluster=azure-cluster-0"
Replace SSH_PUBLIC_KEY with the text of your SSH public key,
as created in the Create an SSH key pair
prerequisite step. If you saved your public key to an environment variable,
you can use ${SSH_PUBLIC_KEY} .
View your cluster status
After you create a cluster and node pool, you can view a cluster's status with
the Google Cloud CLI or the Google Cloud console. To view the cluster's status,
choose if you are using the Google Cloud CLI or Google Cloud console and follow these
steps:
gcloud
Use the gcloud container azure clusters describe command to get details
about your cluster:
gcloud container azure clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--location GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : your cluster's name
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION : the name of the Google Cloud
location that manages the cluster
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Google Kubernetes Engine clusters
overview page.
Go to GKE clusters
Your clusters are listed by their name and location.
Click the cluster's name. A panel with information on the cluster,
including its status and enabled features, appears.
Get authentication credentials for the cluster
After creating your cluster, you need to get authentication credentials to
interact with the cluster:
gcloud container azure clusters get-credentials azure-cluster-0
This command configures kubectl to access the cluster you created using
Connect gateway . You need at
least one node pool to use Connect gateway because it relies on the
Connect agent, which runs as a Deployment in the cluster.
Deploy an application to the cluster
Now that you have created a cluster, you can deploy a containerized application
to it. For this quickstart, you can deploy our example web application,
hello-app .
You use Kubernetes objects to create and manage your
cluster's resources. You use the Deployment object for deploying
stateless applications like web servers.
Service objects define rules
and load balancers for accessing your application from the internet.
Create the Deployment
To run hello-app in your cluster, you need to deploy the application by
running the following command:
kubectl create deployment hello-server --image=us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0
This Kubernetes command,
kubectl create deployment
creates a Deployment named hello-server . The Deployment's
Pod
runs the hello-app container image.
In this command:
--image specifies a container image to deploy. In this case, the command
pulls the example image from an Artifact Registry repository,
us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app . The :1.0
indicates the specific image version to pull. If you don't specify a
version, the image tagged with latest is used.
Expose the Deployment
After deploying the application, you need to expose it to the internet so that
users can access it. You can expose your application by creating a Service, a
Kubernetes resource that exposes your application to external traffic.
To expose your application, run the following
kubectl expose
command:
kubectl expose deployment hello-server --type LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
Passing in the --type LoadBalancer flag creates an Azure load
balancer for your container. The --port flag initializes public port 80 to the
internet and the --target-port flag routes the traffic to port 8080 of the
application.
Load balancers are billed according to Azure load balancer pricing.
Inspect and view the application
Inspect the running Pods by using kubectl get pods :
kubectl get pods
You should see one hello-server Pod running on your cluster.
Inspect the hello-server Service by using kubectl get service :
kubectl get service hello-server
From this command's output, copy the Service's external IP address from the
EXTERNAL-IP column.
Note: You might need to wait several minutes before the Service's
external IP address is available. If the application's external IP is
<pending> , run kubectl get service again.
View the application from your web browser by using the external IP with the
exposed port:
http:// EXTERNAL-IP
You have just deployed a containerized web application to
GKE on Azure.
Clean up
Delete the application's Service and Deployment:
kubectl delete service hello-server
kubectl delete deployment hello-server
Delete your node pool by running
gcloud container azure node-pools delete :
gcloud container azure node-pools delete pool-0 --cluster azure-cluster-0
Delete your cluster by running
gcloud container azure clusters delete :
gcloud container azure clusters delete azure-cluster-0
