Config Controller scalability guidelines
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides recommendations to help plan your config management architecture
on Config Controller instances and keep your Google Cloud resource creation and
management within service-level objectives (SLO).
This page is for Admins and architects and Operators who
manage the lifecycle of the underlying tech infrastructure and plan capacity and
infrastructure needs. To learn more about common roles and example tasks that we
reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Use namespaced mode
We recommended using Config Connector in namespaced mode because it can be easier to manage high numbers of resources. You can set each namespace to correspond to a single namespace, which can help manage quotas and configurations, since resources have read and write quotas per project. Starting in version 1.119.0, you can increase reconciliation rate limits by namespace. By increasing rate limits, you can allow reconciliation for more than 10,000 resources per namespace in a 10 minute interval. Both Config Connector and Config Sync support namespaced mode, which allows for mapping each namespace to a single Google Cloud project.
Scalability targets
The following table represents values we regularly test. We know
that Config Connector can handle larger numbers. We have shown that 30,000
resources can be managed in a single namespace. However there is some tuning
needed to make this work. We recommend you review the Namespaced mode for
suggestions on these changes.
Config Controller scalability targets are groups of resources tested by Google
and with the use of Config Sync GitOps. You
can use these targets to help plan your config management architecture.
These targets are not hard limits. Stretching the amount of one resource kind
won't necessarily make the Config Controller instance unavailable, but it could
reduce the total amount of other resource kinds in the same Config Controller
instance that you can deploy.
The tables on this page are intended as references and are not exhaustive.
Single namespace
The following example shows a Config Controller instance with
one Config Connector namespace in the cluster. Config Connector can create
and manage the following number of resources in that namespace:
Resource type
Suggested limit
SQLInstance
450
SQLDatabase
2,250
SQLUser
2,500
StorageBucket
5,000
ContainerCluster
50
ContainerNodepool
200
IAMServiceAccount
2,500
IAMPartialPolicy
7,500
Multiple namespaces
The following example shows a Config Controller instance with 50 Config Connector
namespaces in a cluster. Config Connector can create and manage the following number
of resources in each namespace:
Resource type
Suggested limit
SQLInstance
9
SQLDatabase
45
SQLUser
45
StorageBucket
100
ContainerCluster
1
ContainerNodepool
4
IAMServiceAccount
50
IAMPartialPolicy
150
Config Connector namespaces
Config Controller uses
Config Connector namespaced mode
by default. The following tables shows an example of the number of Config Connector
namespaces you can have in a single Config Connector instance.
--cluster-ipv4-cidr-block

Checking scalability targets
You can use the following resources to help determine if you have reached
scalability targets.
Google Cloud API Quotas
You can
view your Google Cloud API quotas in the Google Cloud console .
When some quotas are close to their limits, consider
Sharding API quota by Google Cloud projects .
To learn more about monitoring and alerting on quota metrics, see
Set up quota alerts and monitoring .
Config Connector memory use
You can
view your Config Connector memory use in the GKE monitoring dashboard .
When Config Connector's memory use is close to its limit, consider
Sharding by namespace .
Scaling up Config Controller
If you have reached scalability targets, you should consider further scaling up
your Config Controller instances. This section outlines different methods you
can use to scale up your Config Controller instances.
Sharding by namespace
If you reach a scalability target with a single Config Connector namespace, you
can
Configure Config Connector to manage resources in your namespaces .
Note: this method works if Config Connector is installed in namespaced mode,
which is the default for Config Controller.
Each namespace uses its own service accounts and operator workloads, which
allows Config Connector to manage your resources at scale. If you use one Config Connector
instance to manage multiple Google Cloud projects, you can use one
Config Connector namespace to manage each Google Cloud project.
Sharding API quota by Google Cloud projects
If you reach a scalability target due to reaching
Google Cloud API Quotas , you can bind different IAM service
accounts owned by different Google Cloud projects to different namespaces
where Config Connector is installed in namespaced mode. You can then
split your resources into different projects .
Sharding by Config Connector instances
If you reach a scalability target with multiple Config Connector namespaces, you can
create and use more than one Config Controller instance .
With more than one Config Controller instance, you can shard your resource
config management, for example, by different development environments,
application teams, or GitOps directories within your organization.
Other scalability considerations
Google Cloud API quotas
If you've run into errors indicating that you've exceeded the API quota limit,
you might have created too many Config Connector resources of the same Kind
under the same project. Those resources can generate too many API requests to
the same API endpoint because of the
reconciliation strategy in
Config Connector.
To resolve this, you can either
shard API quota by Google Cloud project or request
a quota adjustment .
GKE limitations
Since Config Controller is built on top of GKE, there are
limitations from GKE that you should consider. The following sections cover
specific considerations related to Config Controller. For more information
about general limits and best practices for large GKE clusters, see
Plan for large GKE clusters .
Kubernetes service account limit
​​The number of
Kubernetes Service Accounts (KSA)
created in a single GKE cluster should not exceed 3,000 because you
might encounter a
gke-metadata-server Pod crash issue .
Whenever you add a Config Connector namespace, it also creates a Kubernetes service
account.
GKE control plane performance issues
The
GKE cluster's control plane
can have performance issues if a Config Controller instance has too many
Config Connector namespaces. You should limit the number of Config Connector namespaces to
under 500 per cluster.
Whenever you add a Config Connector namespace, it also creates a controller pod.
