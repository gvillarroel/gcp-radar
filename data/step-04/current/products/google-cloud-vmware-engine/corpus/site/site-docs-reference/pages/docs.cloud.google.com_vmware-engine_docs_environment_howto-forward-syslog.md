Forwarding syslog messages to a remote server
Google Cloud VMware Engine provides the option to send syslog messages to your remote
syslog server. This configuration lets you collate and process syslog messages
using remote logging and monitoring systems.
Caution: Don't update your syslog server configuration using the vCenter Server
Appliance Management Interface (VAMI). VMware Engine automatically
reverts any changes made this way. To configure ESXi syslog forwarding, use the
Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or the VMware Engine API.
Before you begin
The steps in this document assume that you have done the following:
If you want to reference your remote syslog host by name, complete the
following:
For Standard VMware Engine networks,
configure DNS bindings .
For Legacy VMware Engine networks, configure
conditional DNS forwarding rules .
Forward logs
The method of forwarding logs depends on the management appliance that you
want to forward logs for.
For vCenter and ESXi logs, including NSX Distributed Firewall (DFW) Log,
use VMware Engine .
For NSX Manager and NSX Edge VMs, use the
NSX appliance .
Forward logs by using VMware Engine
To configure ESXi or vCenter to forward logs to the syslog server by using the
Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI or VMware Engine API, do the following. If
you plan to forward syslog from ESXi Hosts, change the default port on which the
log agent listens from 5142 to 514 . In that case, use the same port ( 514 )
for forwarding syslog from vCenter as well as NSX.
Console
To forward ESXi or vCenter logs to the syslog server by
using the Google Cloud console, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Private clouds page.
Go to Private clouds
Click Select a project and then select the organization, folder, or project that contains the private cloud.
Select the Syslog tab.
Click Create Source . The subtask for logging server creation
displays.
gcloud
To configure ESXi or vCenter to forward logs to the syslog server by using
the Google Cloud CLI, use the
gcloud vmware private-clouds logging-servers create command .
gcloud vmware private-clouds logging-servers create LOGGING_SERVER_ID \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--hostname=" HOST_NAME " \
--port=" PORT " \
--source-type=" SOURCE_TYPE " \
--protocol=" PROTOCOL " \
--private-cloud= PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID \
--location= ZONE
Replace the following:
LOGGING_SERVER_ID : the logging server ID for
this request.
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request.
HOST_NAME : the IP address or fully qualified
domain name for this request.
PORT : the port number for this request.
SOURCE_TYPE : the source type, either ESXi or
vCenter, for this request.
PROTOCOL : the protocol, either UDP or TCP,
for this request.
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the private cloud ID for
this request.
ZONE : the zone for this request.
API
To configure ESXi or vCenter to forward logs to the syslog server by using
the VMware Engine API, make a POST request:
GET "https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID /loggingServers?logging_server_id= LOGGING_SERVER_ID " -d '{
"hostname": " HOST_NAME ",
"port": " PORT ",
"sourceType": " SOURCE_TYPE ",
"protocol": " PROTOCOL "
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request.
ZONE : the zone for this request.
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the private cloud ID for
this request.
LOGGING_SERVER_ID : the logging server ID for
this request.
HOST_NAME : the IP address or fully qualified
domain name for this request.
PORT : the port number for this request.
SOURCE_TYPE : the source type, either ESXi or
VCSA, for this request.
PROTOCOL : the protocol, either UDP or TCP,
for this request.
Forward logs by using the NSX appliance
The process varies depending on whether you want to forward
NSX Manager or NSX Edge VM logs.
NSX Manager
To configure NSX Manager in your VMware Engine private cloud to
forward logs to your remote syslog server, do the following:
Sign in to the NSX appliance in your private cloud. See
Accessing management appliances .
Go to System > Fabric > Profiles > Node Profiles .
To forward logs from all NSX nodes, select All NSX Nodes . Otherwise,
select only the nodes you want to send the logs from.
In the Syslog Servers section, click Add .
In the FQDN or IP Address field, enter the IP address of your remote
syslog host.
In the Port field, enter the port number on which the remote syslog
server listens.
In the Protocol field, select a communication protocol.
In the Log Level field, select the level of log you want to forward.
Click Add .
NSX Edge VM
To configure NSX Edge VM in your VMware Engine private cloud to
forward logs to your remote syslog server, contact Cloud Customer Care.
