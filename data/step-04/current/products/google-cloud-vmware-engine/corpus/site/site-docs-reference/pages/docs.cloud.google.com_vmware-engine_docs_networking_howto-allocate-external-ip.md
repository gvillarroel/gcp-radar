Reserve an external IP address
External IP addresses allow inbound connections from the internet to a workload
virtual machine (VM) instance, an appliance, or a load balancer running in your
private cloud. For example, if you run a web server on your workload VM, you can
serve web traffic using an external IP address through the internet.
Traffic to and from your external IP addresses follows your
external access firewall rules .
Note: If two VMs that are in a single private cloud or in a single region that
belongs to the same VMware Engine network have external IP addresses, the
communication between the VMs occurs over private IP addresses.
Allocating an external IP address to a resource also provides the following
benefits:
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack prevention. This protection is
automatically enabled for the external IP address.
Always-on traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation of common network-level
attacks.
Protection and mitigation of attacks across the entire scale of the global
network. The network can be used to distribute and mitigate attack traffic
across regions.
Behavior
An external IP address can only be assigned to one internal IP address, and the
external IP address is dedicated to that internal IP address until you unassign
it. A resource associated with an external IP address always uses the external IP
address for internet access. You can reserve up to 100 external IP addresses for
the primary VPC network connected to VMware Engine.
By default, incoming traffic on an external IP address is denied, and only outbound
internet access is allowed. To allow inbound traffic, create an external access rule
for the external IP address to the specific port.
Note: VMware Engine doesn't support allocation of external IP addresses
imported by Bring your own IP (BYOIP) . Caution: If you assign an external IP address to vCenter, NSX, or HCX Manager,
keep in mind the following:
You can only assign rules to port 443 for vCenter and NSX.
Although not required, we strongly recommend opening port 443 for HCX as well.
Before you begin
Before you can allocate an external IP address to a workload VM, you must
create a network policy in the region that applies to
your private cloud and enable the internet access service and the external IP
address service.
Reserve an external IP address
To reserve an external IP address for an internal workload VM or management
appliance using the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI or VMware Engine API, do the following:
Console
To reserve an external IP address for an internal workload VM or management
appliance using the Google Cloud console, complete these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the External IP addresses page.
Go to External IP addresses
Click Select a project and then select the organization, folder, or project
where you want to reserve the external IP address.
Click Reserve .
In the Name field, enter a name to identify the external IP address.
In the Private cloud list, select the private cloud that contains
the workload VM or management appliance.
In the Target workload or appliance VM field, enter the itnernal IP address
that you want to assign this external IP address.
Click Reserve . The newly reserved external IP address appears in
the list of external IP addresses.
gcloud
To reserve an external IP address for an internal workload VM or management
appliance, use the
gcloud vmware private-clouds external-addresses create command :
gcloud vmware private-clouds external-addresses create EXTERNAL_ADDRESS_NAME \
--internal-ip= IP_ADDRESS \
--private-cloud= PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID \
--location= ZONE
Replace the following:
EXTERNAL_ADDRESS_NAME : the name for this external IP address
IP_ADDRESS : the internal IP address that this corresponds to,
for example 192.168.1.11 , for this request
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the name for this private cloud
ZONE : the zone for this request
API
To reserve an external IP address for an internal workload VM or management
appliance using the VMware Engine API, make a POST request:
POST "https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID /externalAddresses?EXTERNAL_ADDRESS_NAME= EXTERNAL_ADDRESS_NAME "
'{
"internal_ip": " IP_ADDRESS "
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request
ZONE : the zone for this request
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the name for this private cloud
EXTERNAL_ADDRESS_NAME : the name for this external IP address
IP_ADDRESS : the internal IP address that this corresponds to,
for example 192.168.1.11 , for this request
Note: The external IP address doesn't need to exist when you allocate the
external IP address. For example, you can create a VM with the external IP
address later. However, the subnet that the external IP address belongs to must
exist on the selected private cloud.
List an external IP address
To see a list of all external IP addresses using the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI or VMware Engine API, do the following:
Console
View a list of all external IP addresses by going to the External IP addresses page, clicking Select a project , and then selecting the organization, folder, or project where you want to list the external IP addresses.
Go to External IP addresses
gcloud
If you want to list all external IP addresses, use the
gcloud vmware private-clouds external-addresses list command :
gcloud vmware private-clouds external-addresses list \
--private-cloud= PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID \
--location= ZONE
Replace the following:
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the name for this private cloud
ZONE : the zone for this request
API
If you want to list all external IP addresses using the VMware Engine API, make a GET request:
GET "https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID /externalAddresses"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request
ZONE : the zone for this request
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the name for this private cloud
Edit an external address
You can only edit the description and the internal IP attached to an existing
external IP resource. You cannot change any other properties.
Console
To edit an IP address:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the External IP addresses page.
Go to External IP addresses
Click Select a project and then select the organization, folder, or project
that contains the external IP address you want to edit.
Click the More more_vert
icon at the end of a row and select Edit .
gcloud
If you want to edit an external IP addresses, use the
gcloud vmware private-clouds external-addresses update command :
gcloud vmware private-clouds external-addresses update EXTERNAL_ADDRESS_NAME \
--internal-ip= IP_ADDRESS
API
If you want to edit an external address using the VMware Engine API, make a PATCH request:
PATCH "https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID /externalAddresses/ EXTERNAL_ADDRESS_NAME ?update_mask=internal_ip"
'{
"internal_ip": " IP_ADDRESS "
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request
ZONE : the zone for this request
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the name for this private cloud
EXTERNAL_ADDRESS_NAME : the name of the external IP for this request
IP_ADDRESS : the IP address, for example 192.168.1.11 , for this request
