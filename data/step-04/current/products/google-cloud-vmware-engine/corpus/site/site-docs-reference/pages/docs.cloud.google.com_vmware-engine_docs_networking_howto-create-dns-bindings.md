Configure DNS bindings
This page describes how to configure DNS bindings for Standard
VMware Engine Networks .
Note: Cloud DNS and DNS bindings are only available for Standard VMware Engine
networks. For Legacy VMware Engine Networks see, Create DNS forwarding rules .
Each private cloud deploys a Cloud DNS Server that is used for all management
appliances resolution. You can configure this server as the DNS server for all
VMware workloads by setting up DNS bindings. To do so, you need to:
Get the IP address of the Private Cloud's DNS server
Set up DNS bind permissions to allow a user principal to bind to the intranet VPC
Configure DNS for your VMware workloads or NSX segment DHCP DNS setting
Before you begin
You can only configure DNS bindings using the gcloud tool or the API.
gcloud and API requirements
To use the gcloud command line tool or the API to manage your VMware Engine
resources, we recommend configuring the tools as described below.
gcloud
Set your default project ID:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Set a default region and zone:
gcloud config set compute/region REGION
gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
For more information on the gcloud vmware tool,
see the Cloud SDK reference docs .
API
API examples in this documentation set use the cURL command-line tool to
query the API. A valid access token is required as part of the cURL
request. There are many ways to get a valid access token; the following
steps use the gcloud tool to generate a access token:
Login to Google Cloud:
gcloud auth login
Generate access token and export to TOKEN:
export TOKEN=`gcloud auth print-access-token`
Verify that TOKEN is set properly:
echo $TOKEN
Now, use the authorization token in your requests to the API. For example:
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer \"$TOKEN\"" -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations
Python
Python code samples in this documentation use the VMware Engine library to communicate with the API. To be able to use this approach, the library needs to be installed and the Application Default Credentials should be configured.
Download and install the Python library:
pip install google-cloud-vmwareengine
Configure the ADC information by executing those command in your shell:
gcloud auth application-default login
Or, use a Service Account key file:
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=" FILE_PATH "
For more information about the library, visit the reference page or view code samples on GitHub .
Get a private cloud workload DNS server IP
Console
To get the IP address of your private cloud's DNS server, follow these steps.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Private clouds page.
Go to Private clouds
Click Select a project and then select the organization, folder, or project
that contains the private cloud you want to connect to.
Click the name of the private cloud.
On the Summary page for the private cloud, under Private Cloud DNS
servers , click Copy to copy the private Cloud DNS server IP address.
gcloud
To get the IP address of your private cloud's DNS server using
Google Cloud CLI, use the gcloud vmware private-clouds describe command :
gcloud vmware private-clouds describe PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION
Replace the following:
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the private cloud name for
this request
PROJECT_ID : the project ID for this request
REGION : the region of the private cloud; if
this is stretched private cloud, specify the zone for this private
cloud
API
To get the IP address of your private cloud's DNS server using the VMware Engine API,
make a GET request:
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN " -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" "https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /privateCloud/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID "
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID for this request
REGION : the region of the private cloud; if
this is stretched private cloud, specify the zone for this private cloud
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the private cloud name for this
request.
Set up DNS bind permissions
You can only set up and manage DNS bind permissions using the gcloud tool or
directly using the REST API. It is not possible to set up bindings
through the console.
Grant DNS bind permission
In order for a user to configure DNS bindings, you must grant a user principal
the permission to bind to the intranet VPC. In this case, a user principal is
the email address of the user who will bind the private DNS zone with the
intranet VPC.
gcloud
gcloud vmware dns-bind-permission grant \
--user= USER \
--project= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
USER : the email of the user who is going to bind the
private DNS zone with the intranet VPC; for example, example1@gmail.com
PROJECT_ID : the project ID for this request
Note: The gcloud vmware dns-bind-permission grant command must be run
in a project with an existing VMware Engine network.
API
Make a POST request to dnsBindPermissions:grant method and provide the
user email address in the request body.
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN " -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/dnsBindPermission:grant -d '
{
"principal": {
"user": " USER "
}
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request.
USER : the email of the user for whom you want to revoke
permissions. For example, example1@gmail.com .
Revoke DNS Bind Permission
Revokes the DNS Bind Permission that was previously granted to the user.
gcloud
gcloud vmware dns-bind-permission revoke \
--user= USER \
--project= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
USER : the email of the user for whom you want to revoke
permissions; for example, example1@gmail.com
PROJECT_ID : the project ID for this request
API
Make a POST request to dnsBindPermissions:revoke and provide the user
email address in the request body.
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN " -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/dnsBindPermission:revoke -d '
{
"principal": {
"user": " USER "
}
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request.
USER : the email of the user for whom you want to revoke
permissions. For example, example1@gmail.com .
Describe DNS bind Permission
Describes DNS bind permissions for a project and which user principal has access
to configure DNS bindings.
gcloud
gcloud vmware dns-bind-permission describe \
--project= PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with the project ID for this request.
API
Make a GET request to dnsBindPermissions resource.
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN " -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/dnsBindPermission
Replace PROJECT_ID with the project for this request.
Binding Private Cloud DNS Zone with the VMware Engine network intranet VPC
Once you grant a user principal the permissions to configure DNS bindings, the
user can create a binding between the private DNS zone in Cloud DNS and the
intranet VPC of the VMware Engine Network. VMware Engine
uses DNS peering to facilitate Cloud DNS resolution.
Locating the Intranet VPC URL
You need the network intranet VPC URL to create the new binding. The VMware Engine network intranet VPC can be found by listing the details
of the VMware Engine network.
Console
To locate the Intranet VPC URL using the Google Cloud console, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VMware Engine networks page.
Go to VMware Engine networks
Click Select a project and then select the organization, folder, or project that
contains the VMware Engine network.
Locate the VMware Engine Network, click the Action option
and select Copy Intranet VPC network URL .
gcloud
gcloud vmware networks describe VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK \
--project= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK : the network to describe
PROJECT_ID : the project ID for this request
API
Make a GET request to the vmwareEngineNetworks resource and provide
the name of the network:
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN " -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/vmwarenEngineNetworks/ NETWORK_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request
NETWORK_ID : the network to describe
Binding
The intended workflow, once bind permissions are configured, is to
add a DNS peering to the VMware Engine network intranet VPC into your standard
Cloud DNS zone management process for each zone.
gcloud
gcloud dns managed-zones create peering- DOMAIN \
--dns-name=" DOMAIN " \
--visibility="private" \
--networks=" INTRANET_VPC_URL " \
--target-project=" PROJECT_ID " \
--target-network=" EXISTING_VPC " \
--description=" DESCRIPTION "
Replace the following:
DOMAIN : the domain to extended, example zone1.example.com
INTRANET_VPC_URL : the intranet VPC URL for the
VMware Engine network
EXISTING_VPC : the URL of the existing VPC network
that the DOMAIN is already bound to
PROJECT_ID : the project ID for this request
API
Make a PATCH request to the managedZones resource and provide
the name of the zone:
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN " -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" https://dns.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /managedZones -d "{
"name": "peering- DOMAIN ",
"description": "",
"dnsName": DOMAIN ,
"peeringConfig": {
"targetNetwork": {
"networkUrl": EXISTING_VPC
}
},
"privateVisibilityConfig": {
"networks": [
{
"networkUrl": INTRANET_VPC_URL
}
]
}
}"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID for this request
DOMAIN : the domain to extended, example zone1.example.com
INTRANET_VPC_URL : the intranet VPC URL for the VMware Engine network.
EXISTING_VPC : the URL of the existing VPC network that the DOMAIN is already bound to
