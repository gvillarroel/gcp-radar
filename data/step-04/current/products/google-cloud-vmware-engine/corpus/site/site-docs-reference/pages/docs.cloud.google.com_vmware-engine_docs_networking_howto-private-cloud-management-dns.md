Configure Management DNS for private clouds
This document describes how to manage a private cloud's management DNS zone
bindings. Use this document if you want to list, create, delete, update, or
review DNS zone bindings. For more information on Cloud DNS, see
Configuring DNS for management appliance access .
List management DNS zone bindings
You can list all the networks that are bound to the private cloud's management
DNS zone. The private cloud VMware Engine network is automatically
bound to the management DNS zone as part of private cloud creation. Any networks
that are peered to the private cloud VMware Engine network are also
automatically bound to the management DNS zone. The management DNS zone bindings
that are created automatically have resource names of the type
auto-bind-xxxxxx .
To list management DNS zone bindings using the Google Cloud CLI or
VMware Engine API, do the following:
gcloud
To list management DNS zone bindings using the Google Cloud CLI,
use the gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings list command :
gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings list \
--private-cloud= PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID \
--location= ZONE
Replace the following:
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the private cloud name for this request.
ZONE : the zone for this request.
API
To list management DNS zone bindings using the VMware Engine API, make a GET request:
GET "https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID /managementDnsZoneBindings"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request.
ZONE : the zone for this request.
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the private cloud name for this request.
Create a management DNS zone binding
A VPC or a VMware Engine network can be bound to the management
DNS zone. To create a new private cloud management DNS zone binding by binding
a VPC or a VMware Engine network using the Google Cloud CLI or
VMware Engine API, do the following:
gcloud
To bind a VPC using the Google Cloud CLI, use the
gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings create command :
gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings create DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID \
--private-cloud= PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID \
--location= ZONE \
--vpc-network=projects/ VPC_PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ VPC_NETWORK
To bind a VMware Engine network, use the
gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings create command :
gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings create DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID \
--private-cloud= PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID \
--location= ZONE \
--vmware-engine-network=projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/vmwareEngineNetworks/ NETWORK_ID
Replace the following:
DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID : the DNS zone binding ID.
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : your private cloud name.
ZONE : the zone for your private cloud.
VPC_PROJECT_ID : the project for your
VPC network.
PROJECT_ID : the project for your private cloud.
NETWORK_ID : the name for your
VMware Engine network.
VPC_NETWORK : the name for your
VPC network.
API
To bind a VPC using the VMware Engine API, make a POST request:
POST "https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID /managementDnsZoneBindings?management_dns_zone_binding_id= DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID " -d '{
"vpc_network": "projects/ VPC_PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ VPC_NETWORK "
}'
To bind a VMware Engine network using the VMware Engine API,
make a POST request:
POST "https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID /managementDnsZoneBindings?management_dns_zone_binding_id= DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID " -d '{
"vmware_engine_network" : " NETWORK_ID "
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for your private cloud.
ZONE : the zone for your private cloud.
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : your private cloud name.
DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID : the DNS zone binding ID.
VPC_PROJECT_ID : the project for your
VPC network.
VPC_NETWORK : the name for your
VPC network.
NETWORK_ID : the name for your
VMware Engine network.
Delete management DNS zone bindings
You can delete a DNS zone binding that was created. Refer to the list of
management DNS zone bindings and find the
DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID
corresponding to the VPC or VMware Engine network with
that you want to remove the binding from. To delete a management DNS zone
binding using the Google Cloud CLI or VMware Engine API, do the following:
gcloud
If you want to delete a management DNS zone binding using the Google Cloud CLI,
use the gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings delete command :
gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings delete DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID \
--private-cloud= PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID \
--location= ZONE
Replace the following:
DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID : the DNS zone binding ID for this request.
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the private cloud name for this request.
ZONE : the zone for this request.
API
If you want to delete a management DNS zone binding using the
VMware Engine API, make a DELETE request:
DELETE "https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID /managementDnsZoneBindings/ DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID "
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request.
ZONE : the zone for this request.
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the private cloud name for this request.
DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID : the DNS zone binding ID for this request.
Edit management DNS zone binding
You can edit a management DNS zone binding description using the Google Cloud CLI or VMware Engine API by doing the following:
gcloud
If you want to edit the description of a management DNS zone binding using the Google Cloud CLI, use the gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings update command :
gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings update DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID \
--private-cloud= PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID \
--location= ZONE \
--description=" DESCRIPTION "
Replace the following:
DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID : the DNS zone binding ID for this request.
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the private cloud name for this request.
ZONE : the zone for this request.
DESCRIPTION : a new description for this request.
API
If you want to edit the description of a management DNS zone binding using the VMware Engine API, make a PATCH request:
PATCH "https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID /managementDnsZoneBindings/ DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID ?update_mask_description" -d '{
"description": " DESCRIPTION "
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request.
ZONE : the zone for this request.
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the private cloud name for this request.
DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID : the DNS zone binding ID for this request.
DESCRIPTION : a new description for this request.
Describe management DNS zone binding
You can get the description of a management DNS zone binding to verify updates using the Google Cloud CLI or VMware Engine API by doing the following:
gcloud
If you want to get the description of a management DNS zone binding using the Google Cloud CLI, use the gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings describe command :
gcloud vmware private-clouds management-dns-zone-bindings describe DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID \
--private-cloud= PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID \
--location= ZONE
Replace the following:
DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID : the DNS zone binding ID for this request.
PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID : the private cloud name for this request.
ZONE : the zone for this request.
API
If you want to get the description of a management DNS zone binding using the VMware Engine API, make a GET request:
GET "https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_ID /managementDnsZoneBindings/ DNS_ZONE_BINDING_ID "
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request.
