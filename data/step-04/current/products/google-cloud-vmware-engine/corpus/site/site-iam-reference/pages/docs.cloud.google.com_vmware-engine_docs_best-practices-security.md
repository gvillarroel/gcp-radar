Best practices for VMware Engine security
This document describes the recommended security best practices for managing and
configuring Google Cloud VMware Engine and is intended for users who are already familiar
with VMware Engine. If you are a beginner, you may consider starting
with learning about the
prerequisites
and VMware Engine
security .
VMware Engine has a shared
responsibility
model for security. Trusted security in the cloud is achieved through the shared
responsibilities of customers and Google as a service provider. Following these
best practices can help you save time, prevent errors, and mitigate the effects
of points of failure.
VMware Engine Networking
The following sections introduce best practices for networking in a
VMware Engine environment.
Identify and understand all traffic flows of your environment
VMware Engine leverages VMware Engine networks
and VPC peerings to connect a
private network connection from a VMware Engine private cloud
network to your VPC network. Inbound traffic from a VPC in your
Google Cloud environment or from an on-premises network traverses a
Google-managed tenancy unit network.
Use VMware Engine's Public IP Service for internet data transfer
Internet traffic can enter a private cloud directly using the Public IP Service
of VMware Engine. Alternatively, internet traffic can enter using a
public load balancer on Google Cloud. In that case, the traffic is routed
like any other inbound traffic. Note that these
options are mutually exclusive. If custom controls are required for internet
traffic, such as URL filtering, IPS/IDS or traffic inspection provided by a
central instance or service in your Google Cloud environment, you should
route internet-bound traffic through VPC network.
If this is not applicable to you or you have the controls implemented within
your private cloud, we recommend that you include the external IP address service
in VMware Engine. In addition, we recommend using
external access rules
to deny traffic patterns from the internet that don't apply to your
applications.
Separate north-south and east-west firewall rules on gateway and distributed firewall in VMware Engine NSX
Configure the distributed firewall (DFW) in NSX on the tier-1 logical router
to segment internal traffic between your virtual layer 2 domains. The NSX DFW is
designed to handle (internal) east-west network traffic between segments and
allows firewall rules that allow and deny traffic between individual instances
inside a segment.
For fine-grained network access control make sure to apply a restricted default
policy on the DFW to deny network traffic between instances by default. Use the
DFW to specifically allow traffic between applications and between services
inside your application.
Configure the NSX gateway firewall
to control north-south traffic that enters and leaves the private cloud.
The NSX gateway firewall is designed to control north-south traffic and
recommended for use cases such as controlling
the traffic at a perimeter to another security
zone . If you need to configure the north-south traffic for the entire
private cloud consistently, then configure the gateway firewall on the tier-0
router. If you need to configure the north-south traffic for each individual
NSX segment, then configure the gateway firewall on the tier-1 router.
In addition to NSX firewalls, we recommend using the VPC firewall to
allow and block east-west traffic between workloads in the
VMware Engine private cloud and workloads in VPCs. Inbound data transfer to
Compute Engine instances from VMware Engine workloads should be
restricted by default with only consciously opened traffic.
Outbound data transfer to management appliances as well as to the vSphere/vSAN CIDR range should
be blocked from VPCs as well using the VPC firewall. Only open outbound data transfer towards
management appliances from trusted hosts and IP addresses inside your network.
It's important to note that management appliances are not inside an NSX
segment and hence, DFW rules don't apply to restrict access.
Apply Zero Trust Security principles and micro-segmentation in NSX
Use the NSX DFW to implement traffic controls for security segments that
are as granular as individual virtual machines. This principle of protecting
traffic between individual VMs that is denied by default is often also referred
to as "Micro-segmentation" ,
which is a more granular approach for firewalling than the conventional
implementation of firewalls between Layer 3 domains.
The DFW is enabled in the hypervisor kernel on all VMware Engine
vSphere hosts in your private cloud and can control traffic flow between
workloads that are either in the same or in separate NSX segments. Firewall
rules to allow traffic to and from VMs can be defined by organizing the VMs into
policy groups , which can have flexible membership criteria such as VM tag or name matching.
Micro-segmentation lets you implement a network with fine-grained traffic
control where a traffic pattern needs to be explicitly allowed. The
security concept where all network flows are controlled by identity and device
verification processes rather than implicit trust is often also called Zero
Trust Security .
Deploy a third-party firewall appliance from the Cloud Marketplace portal for IPS/IDS capabilities
If you require advanced Layer 7 security, including IDS/IPS capabilities for
inbound traffic into the private cloud from the rest of your network or between
your NSX network segments, consider deploying a third-party firewall
appliance. The third-party appliance can be deployed either as a multi-NIC
appliance between two VPCs in your Google Cloud network or inside the
private cloud with an integration with NSX.
For a deep-dive in VMware Engine architectures with centralized
appliances, which can be used for a variety of advanced security use cases, such
as IPS/IDS, DDoS, SSL offloading and more, consult the document network security
using centralized appliances in the Cloud Architecture
Center .
Use Google Cloud Armor to help protect web services on VMware Engine from DDoS attacks
If you route inbound traffic to workloads on VMware Engine through
the customer VPC, then we recommend placing VMware Engine workloads
in hybrid network endpoint groups behind Cloud Service Mesh and leveraging the
external HTTP(S) load balancer. Either setup lets you include
Google Cloud Armor for public-facing applications, mitigating DDoS attacks and
common vulnerabilities like SQL injections or cross-site scripting.
If you require Service Mesh features such as advanced traffic management using
the Envoy proxy or integration of Certificate Authority Service, we recommend
Cloud Service Mesh. In all other cases, we recommend the external HTTP(S) load
balancer.
Follow the documentation on how VMware Engine workloads can be added
to Hybrid NEGs in either one of the following setups:
Regional external HTTP(S) load balancing with hybrid connectivity
Global external HTTP(S) load balancer with hybrid connectivity
Connect to Google Cloud Services privately without internet access
VMware Engine private cloud workloads can access Google Cloud
APIs such as the Cloud Storage API using Private Google Access. We recommend
you use Private Google Access to access Google services without sending
traffic over the internet because it reduces outbound data transfer cost and latency. This also
removes the need for a network path to the internet for workloads that only need
Google API access. Follow the deep-dive into Private Google Access for more
technical details and configuration steps.
Similarly, VMware Engine workloads which need to access
Google Cloud resources from a service producer network such as
Cloud SQL or Memorystore instances should connect privately using
PSA. For more information, visit the section on PSA for
VMware Engine.
Encrypt the communication between your on-premises environment and Google Cloud
Workloads on VMware Engine that need to communicate with on-premises
systems should connect over an encrypted channel. We recommend a layered
approach for encryption in-transit between your on-premises data centers and
Google Cloud. The link between on-premises systems and Google Cloud
can either be encrypted by setting up Cloud VPN with an IPsec tunnel or by
using the built-in IPsec on VLAN attachments of the Interconnect. In addition,
application layer encryption should be enabled between application components
using TLS.
Help protect your data from exfiltration using VPC Service Controls
We recommend mitigating data exfiltration risks using VPC Service Controls
by placing your sensitive resources such as Cloud Storage buckets and
BigQuery datasets into a VPC Service Controls perimeter. Workloads that need to
access data inside a perimeter need to be placed into the perimeter as well.
Specifically, the Google Cloud project that hosts the private cloud needs
to be part of the VPC Service Controls perimeter to access resources that are
protected by VPC Service Controls.
You need to configure inbound and outbound data transfer policies in your VPC Service Controls
configuration to allow the VMware Engine producer service APIs into
the perimeter. For detailed guidance on the setup, follow our documentation pages
on VPC Service Controls with VMware Engine.
VMware Engine IAM and permissions
The following sections introduce best practices for user permissions in a
VMware Engine environment. It's important to take care of permissions
within the VMware Engine environment and the Google Cloud project in
which the private cloud is deployed.
Use predefined roles or custom roles to grant access
The VMware Engine approach to manage vSphere roles and permissions
can be leveraged the same way you are used to leveraging from other
VMware Engine environments. However, activities like deploying a
cluster require permissions in Identity and Access Management (IAM). The following table
lists relevant access managers, the identity sources that they grant permissions
to, and example activities that they enable.

vCenter
VM Guest Operating System
Active Directory, LDAP, Local Users, for example
Guest Operating System
SSH or RDP Login, file operations, for example
In Google Cloud IAM, there are two predefined roles with
permissions to the VMware Engine portal:
VMware Engine Service Admin - gives full access to the
VMware Engine service on Google Cloud.
VMware Engine Service Viewer - gives read-only access to the
VMware Engine service on Google Cloud.
These permissions relate to actions in the VMware Engine portal and
don't relate to actions in the API or CLI. Note that also the basic roles
include the ability to manage the VMware Engine service (Owner,
Editor) or to view the service details (Viewer). Generally, we recommend you
use predefined roles instead of basic roles because they provide more
fine-grained permissions.
Programmatic access to the VMware Engine using service accounts using
the API or CLI should be constrained using predefined roles or custom roles
because they include more fine-grained permissions that apply only to
VMware Engine. If programmatic access is only used for a task that
requires only a specific subset of the permissions of the predefined roles, then
we recommend you create a custom role.
Choose an appropriate location for the IAM role assignment in
your organization's resource hierarchy. If you are running all your
VMware Engine private clouds in one project only the roles can be
assigned on project level. If there are technical or organizational requirements
that result in your private clouds being located in separate projects, define
the required roles in a folder that is common to the projects used for your
private clouds.
Cloud IAM permissions are not required for activities that only
need to be done inside vCenter, NSX or HCX. Staff that only needs to operate
these environments don't require the previously listed IAM
roles. Instead, they should use LDAP identities with permissions configured in
vCenter and NSX. We recommend to provide the VMware Engine Service
Admin or VMware Engine Service Viewer roles only to a very limited
number of users since these roles grant access to the powerful CloudOwner user
account for vCenter and the administrator user account for NSX. These user
accounts should only be used for initial setup or emergency procedures.
Restrict and actively audit administrator access
The VMware Engine Service Admin role is very powerful and should only
be assigned to users who need to manage the lifecycle of the
VMware Engine private cloud and their clusters. Typically, the manual
addition or deletion of clusters and nodes is an action that does not happen
frequently and may have a high impact on billing or the availability of the
cluster. Only assign this role to very few people in your organization.
Make sure to regularly audit who has been assigned the VMware Engine
Service Admin role, either directly on the project that is used for
VMware Engine or on one of the parent levels of the resource
hierarchy. This audit should include other roles, like the basic Editor and
Owner roles that include critical permissions related to
VMware Engine. You can use services like the IAM roles
recommender to help identify overly privileged roles.
Configure an LDAP or Active Directory identity source
An identity provider which supports LDAP authentication, such as Active
Directory, should be configured to enable user authentication for vCenter and
NSX Manager. This is a recommended practice to have central identity lifecycle
management, group management, password management and more. Note that directly
joining vCenter and NSX to Active Directory for integrated Windows
authentication is not supported.
Rotate the passwords of built-in service accounts
VMware Engine generates credentials to access management appliances
in the private cloud (such as vCenter, NSX and HCX). We recommend that you
establish a process to rotate the passwords of the default vCenter service
account CloudOwner@gve.local and the default NSX service account administrator.
Both user accounts should only be used for the initial configuration and
emergency procedures and their passwords be rotated regularly (for example,
every 60 or 90 days).
Equivalently, regularly rotate the passwords of solution user accounts which are
commonly used for the integration of third-party tooling. The more often you
rotate service account passwords, the less likely it is that the password is
still valid when a bad actor finds it.
VMware Engine Logging and Monitoring
The following sections introduce best practices for logging and monitoring of
both VM workloads and the VMware Engine infrastructure, which provides
the resources that workloads consume.
Ingest VMware Engine logs and metrics
Many organizations want to collect and analyze logs in a centralized "Single
Pane of Glass." In Google Cloud, the Cloud Logging and
Cloud Monitoring products provide services which can be used for centralized
management of logs and metrics. VMware Engine can be integrated with
Cloud Monitoring using a standalone agent. In this configuration, vCenter
forwards metrics such as ESXi CPU and memory utilization to Cloud Monitoring.
We recommend you create dashboards based on metrics that are forwarded by
vCenter, or to get started with some sample dashboards that have been published
on GitHub.
To collect platform logs, VMware Engine private clouds can forward
Syslog logs to a centralized log aggregator. This can be done both for vCenter
and NSX Syslog messages. Collecting, retaining and analyzing Syslog messages
from vCenter has important security use cases, such as real-time alerting based
on administrative user (or emergency user) logins, which should be performed
only in exceptional circumstances. To analyze Syslog messages, a Syslog
aggregator such as Fluentd or the Standalone agent needs to be configured to
relay the messages to Cloud Logging.
We recommend that you analyze logs from VMware Engine in a central
dashboard in a single project. If your VMware Engine environment
spans multiple projects, you additionally need to aggregate your projects by
configuring log sinks and monitoring scopes.
Use the Cloud Logging agent for workload VM logging
VMware Engine workload VMs can send logs directly to
Cloud Logging API, using the Logging agent. The Logging agent is based on
fluentd and streams logs from common third-party applications and system
software to Cloud Logging. As a best practice, align the approach for
collecting and analyzing logs for workload VMs on VMware Engine with
the approach for Compute Engine instances and your on-premises estate (if
applicable). The use of the Logging agent on VMware Engine matches the
approach that is used for VMs on Compute Engine such that workloads on both
platforms send their logs to Cloud Logging.
Apply equivalent capabilities of Access Transparency and Access Approval policies
While VMware Engine doesn't support access transparency
(AxT) and access approval (AxA) in Google Cloud, we have implemented
processes with equivalent capabilities that can be enabled by request.
For access transparency equivalency you need to consider several sources of
logs, including:
vCenter logs - exportable using remote syslog server configuration.
ESXi logs - these can be collected using remote syslog configuration,
however, you need to file a support request with Google Cloud to
configure ESXi syslog forwarding.
If you have strict regulatory requirements, we implement a policy to provide
equivalent capabilities for access approval. In this policy, standard service
operations require a support ticket to be generated with a reason why access
service operators require access.
Google Cloud Access Approval

VMware Engine Encryption
The following sections introduce best practices for the encryption of storage in
the private cloud, and driving factors to consider when choosing a key provider
for your private cloud.
Use a Google-owned and managed key provider enabled for vSAN encryption at rest
Encryption of data at rest is implemented using vSAN software based encryption.
By default, VMware Engine enables vSAN encryption on each ESXi
cluster and configures a default key provider in vCenter. Google requires
customers to keep vSAN encryption enabled on their ESXi clusters and disabling
vSAN encryption is a violation of the service terms for VMware Engine. Many organizations require encryption at rest as part of their company
policies or are obligated by regulations to encrypt data (for example, NIST,
FIPS).
Each ESXi host encrypts data using the standard AES-256 XTS mode with different,
randomly generated Data Encryption Keys (DEK). The DEK is encrypted using a Key
Encryption Key (KEK) and only stored on the disk in encrypted form. The vCenter
server only stores the ID of the KEK but not the KEK itself which is stored in a
Cloud Key Management Service (KMS). You can choose the location of the Cloud KMS where
your KEK is kept.
We recommend you use the Google-managed default key provider. If, however,
you are required to manage your Cloud KMS yourself, you can use a
third-party KMIP 1.1 compliant Cloud KMS by one of the supported
vendors. In both cases, the key provider can be used to encrypt data at-rest and
vMotion traffic in-transit.
The following table highlights key differences between the default key provider
and third-party Cloud KMS integrations:
Key provider
Pros
Cons
Default Google-owned and managed key provider
Simplicity: Deployed "out of the box" with no vendor management and no operational burden
End-to-end support by Google
Simplest method of the ability to rotate DEKs/KEKs is the key requirement
No additional cost
Built-in zone redundancy for high availability
Not possible to bring your own key material (BYOK)
The KEKs are stored and managed in the Google infrastructure. External Key Managers (EKM) are not supported.
Third-party Cloud KMS key provider
Full control over the encrypted data and encryption key
Hardware backed keys can be stored in an HSM appliance
Additional complexity and operational overhead
Additional cost
Possible additional latency, especially in the case of SaaS KMS
Possible lower availability
Note that we don't recommend that you enable VM-level encryption together with
vSAN datastore encryption because
deduplication efficiency
approaches zero for encrypted VMs.
Automate the rotation of encryption keys according to your organization's standards
You are responsible for the KEK rotation using VMware Engine vSphere.
This is the case both with the default key
provider and with an external Cloud KMS. The KEK rotation can be
initiated from vCenter or using its API. Consider automating the KEK rotation
according to your organization's requirements. You can find an example PowerCLI
script on GitHub.
VMware Engine backup and disaster recovery
It's important to protect your data against threats like ransomware, corruption,
and human error. Further, business-critical applications rely on your data being
available virtually at all times, leaving you little time to recover data from
sudden outages. This section does not contain a full coverage of all backup and
disaster recovery aspects that are relevant to effectively design a backup and
DR strategy to keep your data secure and available but contain key
considerations when choosing the right strategy for your
VMware Engine environment.
Backup your workloads using Backup and DR Service
With Backup and DR Service Google Cloud offers a centrally managed, built-in
backup solution that can be used for a variety of use cases, including backup of
workloads on Compute Engine and Google Cloud VMware Engine.
Backup and DR Service is Google's recommended single solution for workload
backups because it offers benefits such as a broad spectrum of workload
support, space-efficient, incremental-forever backups, and flexible storage
options.
Google Cloud VMware Engine also supports using third-party,
agent-based backup solutions. You may prefer these if you already have licenses
for a third-party backup product. Prerequisites for these kinds of tools include
the following:
They provide application-level backups
They are certified by the application vendors
They are certified by VMware Engine for vSAN
They support the VMware Engine vStorage API for Data Protection
(VADP) protocol standard or take application-level backups
Regardless of the backup solution of your choice, we recommend
Cloud Storage as a cost-effective storage option for long-term retention of
backups. Cloud Storage is a highly durable, cost-effective object storage.
Cloud Storage buckets can be configured to automatically replicate storage
objects across multiple regions which is ideal for multi-regional cloud
topologies.
Cloud Storage is also ideal for long-term archival as it provides lifecycle
policies to automatically move storage objects to another storage tier once
their lifetime exceeds a predefined value. Use this option for a cost-effective
backup storage location and medium to high RPOs, especially if cost is a driving
factor.
Alternatively, you can choose vSAN storage to minimize RPO instead. Use this
storage option if a higher cost for backup storage is acceptable and RPO
requirements can't be met with Cloud Storage. Avoid this option for
long-term archival, since there is a risk that VMware Engine cluster
sizes become storage bound.
Implement disaster recovery with Backup and DR Service
We recommend restoring applications on VMware Engine using
Backup and DR Service. To help protect your production workloads from outages of a
single zone inside a region, we recommend that you deploy and operate a private
cloud in a secondary zone inside the region if VMware Engine is
available in more than one zone of that region. If this is not the case, we
recommend restoring your applications in a secondary region.
In addition to Google Cloud Backup and DR,
VMware Engine is compatible with other options for DR such as
VMware Engine SRM and Zerto. Both VMware Engine SRM and
Zerto rely on vSphere replication for disaster recovery which generally supports
lower RPO targets. If your RPO target is minutes rather than hours, consider DR
solutions based on vSphere replication.
