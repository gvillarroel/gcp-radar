Asset inventory services for VMware Engine
Cloud Asset Inventory provides inventory services based on a time series database that
lets you to search, export, and analyze asset metadata associated with the
onboarded resources. Cloud Asset Inventory is a fully managed inventory service
where you can control the access to Cloud Asset Inventory data down to each
resource and policy type. This lets you benefit from the power of a centralized
inventory, and also achieve least privilege when needed.
Key VMware Engine resources or assets are available through the
Cloud Asset API and are also available using the Cloud Asset Inventory UI under
Identity and Access Management on your Google Cloud console. The Cloud Asset API resources include:
PrivateCloud
Cluster
VMwareEngineNetwork
NetworkPeering
PrivateConnection
NetworkPolicy
ExternalAccessRule
ExternalAddress
For these resources, the Cloud Asset Inventory UI and Cloud Asset API enable the
following features:
Search and visibility: Search asset metadata, including
IAM policies associated with it by using a custom query
language.
SearchAllResources : Searches all Google Cloud
resources within the specified scope, such as project, folder, or
organization.
SearchAllIamPolicies : Searches all
IAM policies within the specified scope, such as project,
folder, or organization.
ListAssets : View a paginated list of the assets at a
given timestamp.
QueryAssets : Issue a job that queries assets using a
SQL statement compatible with BigQuery SQL.
These API also enable you to use the Global Search on the
Google Cloud console to find VMware Engine resources. Use the global
search bar to search for the name of any VMware Engine resource
that's available through the Cloud Asset API. The resource displays in
the list of results.
To search VMware Engine resources or IAM policies
using the Cloud Asset Inventory console, do the following:
Go to the Asset Inventory page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Asset Inventory
To set the scope of your search, open the Projects list box in the menu
bar, and then select the organization, folder, or project to query.
Select the Resource or IAM Policy tab.
For Filter results , check the box next to the chosen filters.
The resources or policies matching the query are listed in the Result
table.
To view the query as a Google Cloud CLI command, select View query .
To export the results, select Download CSV .
Monitoring and analysis: You can export all asset metadata at a certain
timestamp or export event change history during a specific timeframe.
Further, you can also monitor asset changes by subscribing to real-time
notifications.
ExportAssets : Exports assets with time and resource
types to a given Cloud Storage location or BigQuery table.
BatchGetAssetsHistory : Batch gets the update
history of assets that overlap a time window.
Feed : An asset feed used to export asset updates to a
destination. Set up Pub/Sub channels to get real-time updates on
any asset config change, reduce the frequency of exports, and
achieve continuous monitoring.
To analyze which IAM policies have access to which
Google Cloud resources using the Cloud Asset Inventory console, do the
following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy Analyzer
page.
Go to the Policy Analyzer page
In the Analyze policies section, find the pane labeled Custom
query and click Create custom query in that pane.
In the Select query scope field, select the project, folder, or
organization that you want to scope the query to.
Policy Analyzer will analyze access for that project, folder,
or organization, as well as any resources within that project, folder,
or organization.
Choose the resource to check and the role or permission to check for:
In the Parameter 1 field, select Resource from the drop-down
menu.
In the Resource field, enter the full resource name of the resource
that you want to analyze access for. If you don't know the full resource
name, start typing the display name of the resource, then select the
resource from the list of resources provided.
Click add Add selector .
In the Parameter 2 field, select either Role or Permission .
In the Select a role or Select a permission field, select the
role or permission that you want to check for.
Optional: To check for additional roles and permissions, continue adding
Role and Permission selectors until all the roles and permissions
that you want to check for are listed.
Optional: Click Continue , then select any
advanced options that you want to enable for this query.
In the Custom query pane, click Analyze > Run
query . The report page shows the query parameters you entered, and a
results table of all principals with the specified roles or permissions
on the specified resource.
Policy analysis queries in the Google Cloud console run for up to one minute. After
one minute, the Google Cloud console stops the query and displays all available
results. If the query didn't finish in that time, the Google Cloud console displays
a banner indicating that the results are incomplete. To get more results
for these queries,
export the
results to BigQuery .
IAM policy analysis: Analyze policy APIs to find
out who has access to what.
AnalyzeIamPolicy : Analyzes IAM
policies to answer which identities have what accesses on which
resources.
AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning : Analyzes
IAM policies asynchronously to answer which identities
have what accesses on which resources, and writes the analysis results
to a Cloud Storage or a BigQuery destination.

resources available using Cloud Asset Inventory and
