Private cloud VMware components
A private cloud is an isolated VMware stack (ESXi hosts, vCenter, vSAN, and NSX)
environment managed by a vCenter Server in a management domain.
Google Cloud VMware Engine deploys private clouds with the following VMware stack
components:
VMware ESXi: hypervisor on dedicated nodes
VMware vCenter: centralized management of private cloud vSphere
environment
VMware vSAN: hyper-converged, software-defined storage platform
VMware NSX Data Center: network virtualization and security software
VMware HCX: application migration and workload rebalancing across data
centers and clouds
You can
retrieve generated sign-in credentials
for VMware stack components from the private cloud details page.
VMware component versions
A private cloud VMware stack has the following software versions:
Component
Version
Licensed version
ESXi
8.0 Update 3f
VMware Cloud Foundation
vCenter
8.0 Update 3e

VMware Cloud Foundation
1 VMware Engine deploys a version of HCX made available
to Google Cloud by VMware. Update HCX after private cloud creation to
retrieve the latest version of HCX for your environment.
ESXi
When you create a private cloud, VMware ESXi is installed on provisioned
Google Cloud VMware Engine nodes. ESXi provides the hypervisor for deploying workload
virtual machines (VMs). Nodes provide hyper-converged infrastructure (compute
and storage) and are a part of the vSphere cluster on your private cloud.
Each node has four physical network interfaces connected to the underlying
network. VMware Engine creates a vSphere distributed switch (VDS) on
the vCenter using these physical network interfaces as uplinks. Network
interfaces are configured in active mode for high availability.
vCenter Server Appliance
vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) provides the authentication, management, and
orchestration functions for VMware Engine. When you create and deploy
your private cloud, VMware Engine deploys a VCSA with an embedded
Platform Services Controller (PSC) on the vSphere cluster. Each private cloud
has its own VCSA. Adding nodes to a private cloud adds nodes to the VCSA.
vCenter Single Sign-On
The embedded platform services controller on VCSA is associated with a vCenter
Single Sign-On. The domain name is gve.local . To access vCenter, use the
default user, CloudOwner@gve.local , which is created for you to access
vCenter. You can add your on-premises/Active Directory identity sources for
vCenter .
vSAN storage
Important: To be compliant with service-level agreement (SLA), VMware Engine requires slack space of 25% available on vSAN.
Clusters in private clouds have fully configured all-flash vSAN storage. The
all-flash storage is provided by local SSDs. At least three nodes of the same
SKU are required to create a vSphere cluster with a vSAN datastore. Each node of
the vSphere cluster has two disk groups. Each disk group contains one cache disk
and three capacity disks.
You can enable deduplication and compression
on the vSAN datastore in VMware Engine. This service enables vSAN
deduplication and compression by default when a new cluster is created. Each
cluster on your private cloud contains a vSAN datastore. If the stored virtual
machine data isn't suitable for vSAN space efficiency by deduplication and
compression or only by compression, you can change vSAN space efficiency to the
chosen configuration on the individual vSAN datastore.
Warning: Disabling deduplication and compression requires a vSAN resync, which
can take a long time when large amounts of data is stored.
In addition to vSAN Advanced features, VMware Engine also provides
access to vSAN Enterprise data encryption for data at rest and data in transit.
vSAN storage policies
A vSAN storage policy defines the Failures to tolerate (FTT) and the
Failure tolerance method . You can create new storage policies and apply them
to VMs. To maintain SLA , you must maintain 20% spare capacity on the
vSAN datastore.
On each vSphere cluster, there's a default vSAN storage policy that applies to
the vSAN datastore. The storage policy determines how to provision and allocate
VM storage objects within the datastore to ensure a level of service.
The following table shows the default vSAN storage policy parameters:
FTT
Failure tolerance method
Number of nodes in vSphere cluster

Using licenses
Google Cloud is a VMware Cloud partner. You can choose a committed use discount (CUD) type
that includes licenses as part of the managed VMware Engine service, or
you can choose to bring your own licenses.
Updates and upgrades
This section describes update and upgrade considerations and lifecycle
management responsibilities for software components.
HCX
VMware Engine handles initial installation, configuration, and
monitoring of HCX in private clouds. After that, you are responsible for
lifecycle management of HCX Cloud and service appliances like HCX-IX
Interconnect.
VMware provides updates for HCX Cloud through its HCX service. You can upgrade
HCX Manager and deployed HCX service appliances from the HCX Cloud interface. To
find the end of support date for a product release, refer to the VMware Product Lifecycle Matrix .
Other VMware software
Google is responsible for lifecycle management of VMware software (ESXi,
vCenter, PSC, and NSX) in the private cloud.
Software updates include:
Patches: security patches or bug fixes released by VMware
Updates: minor version change of a VMware stack component
Upgrades: major version change of a VMware stack component
Google tests a critical security patch as soon as it becomes available from
VMware. Per SLA, Google rolls out the security patch to private cloud
environments within a week.
Google provides quarterly maintenance updates to VMware software components. For
a new major version of VMware software version, Google works with customers to
coordinate a suitable maintenance window for upgrade.
vSphere cluster
To ensure high availability of the private cloud, ESXi hosts are configured as a
cluster. When you create a private cloud, VMware Engine deploys
management components of vSphere on the first cluster. VMware Engine
creates a resource pool for management components, and deploys all management
VMs in this resource pool.
The first cluster cannot be deleted to shrink the private cloud. The vSphere
cluster uses vSphere HA to provide high availability for VMs. Failures to
tolerate (FTT) are based on the number of available nodes in the cluster. The
formula Number of nodes = 2N+1 , where N is the FTT, describes the
relationship between available nodes in a cluster and FTT.
For production workloads, use a private cloud that contains at least 3 nodes.
Single node private clouds
For testing and proofs of concept with VMware Engine, you can create
a private cloud that contains only a single node and cluster.
VMware Engine deletes private clouds that contain only 1 node after
60 days, along with any associated workload VMs and data.
You can resize a single node private cloud to contain 3 or more nodes. When you
do so, VMware Engine initiates vSAN data replication and no longer
attempts to delete the private cloud. A private cloud must contain at least 3
nodes and complete vSAN data replication to be eligible for coverage based on
the SLA .
Features or operations that require more than 1 node won't work with a single
node private cloud. For example, you won't be able to use vSphere Distributed
Resource Scheduler (DRS) or High Availability (HA).
vSphere cluster limits
The following table describes vSphere cluster limits in standard private clouds that meet
SLA requirements:
Resource
Limit
Minimum number of nodes to create a private cloud (first cluster)

Minimum number of nodes to create a cluster
3
Maximum number of nodes per cluster
32
Maximum number of nodes per private cloud

96
Maximum number of clusters per stretched private cloud
16
Guest operating system support
You can install a VM with any guest operating system supported by VMware for the
ESXi version in your private cloud. For a list of supported guest operating
systems, see the VMware Compatibility Guide for Guest OS .
VMware infrastructure maintenance
Occasionally it's necessary to make changes to the configuration of the VMware
infrastructure. These intervals can occur every 1‑2 months, but the frequency is expected to decline over time. This type of maintenance can usually be done without interrupting normal usage of the services.
During a VMware maintenance interval, the following services continue to
function without any effect:
VMware management plane and applications
vCenter access
All networking and storage
All cloud traffic
External Storage
You can expand the storage capacity of a Google Cloud VMware Engine cluster by adding
more nodes. Alternatively, you can use external storage if you only want to
scale storage. Scaling storage increases the storage capacity without increasing
the compute capacity of the cluster, allowing you to scale your resource
independently.
Contact Google Support or your sales representative for more information about
using external storage.
