Requesting API access and quota
Before you can create private clouds or access Google Cloud VMware Engine, you must
enable the corresponding VMware Engine API and have node quota available.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the VMware Engine API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .

Request VMware Engine node quota
Your node quotas describe the maximum number of nodes you can assign in a region
and across all regions in total, assuming nodes are available. You must have
available quota in your Google Cloud project to create a private cloud in
that Google Cloud project.
You assign VMware Engine node quota per Google Cloud project, per
region. Additionally, your Google Cloud project has a global node quota that
represents the total quota across all regions. To increase your quota and assign
more nodes, you must submit a quota increase request and receive approval.
Each private cloud must contain a minimum of three nodes. To view your
Google Cloud project's available quota or request a quota increase, see
Quotas and limits .
