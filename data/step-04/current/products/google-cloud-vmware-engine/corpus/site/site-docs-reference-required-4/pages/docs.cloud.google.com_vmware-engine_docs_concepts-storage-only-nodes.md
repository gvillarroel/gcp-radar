Storage-only nodes
A storage-only node, also known as storage node, is a VMware Engine
node type that does not have any customer-usable cores and only has
customer-usable storage. These nodes can be added to a cluster of
VMware Engine hyper converged nodes to increase the storage capacity of
the cluster without adding cores to the cluster.
Note: A cluster can consist of a maximum of 50% storage-only nodes.
A dedicated cluster made up entirely of storage-only nodes is not supported
because the workload VMs can't run on storage-only nodes.
Storage-only nodes can only be added to a management cluster with a minimum of
three HCI nodes and a workload cluster that has at least two HCI nodes.
Storage-only nodes are available using the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI and
VMware Engine API. The storage nodes don't contribute cores or memory to the
private cloud and cluster and can't run VMs. You can use the Google Cloud CLI and
VMware Engine API to query the number of storage-only nodes in a cluster.
By accessing the vCenter UI, you can identify which ESXi hosts are configured as
storage-only nodes by looking at tags assigned to ESXi hosts. You can query for
the tag storage_only_node in vCenter and find all ESXi hosts that
have this tag.
Limitations
When using a cluster made up of two HCI and one storage node, if there's an
HCI node failure, there might be only one available HCI node in the cluster
to run VMs. This scenario can remain until the cluster adds a replacement
node, at which time your cluster is restored back to resilience.
You won't be able to use vMotion on a VM to a storage node within a cluster.
If you try to perform this action, you may see a vCenter error stating that
there are insufficient resources on the storage node. Instead, you can use
the vCenter interface to query the "storage-only" tag to find all ESXi hosts
that are configured as storage nodes.
Converting a storage node to an HCI node and the other way around is not
supported.
When a cluster contains storage-only nodes, the vCenter cluster summary
reports physical CPU and memory for all nodes of the cluster, including
compute capacity from storage-only nodes which is unavailable for running
VMs. For an accurate
view of available compute resources, use vSphere Distributed Resource
Scheduler (DRS) stats for CPU and memory utilization. To manually calculate
available compute resources from cluster summary metrics, exclude compute
capacity proportional to the percentage of storage-only nodes in your
vSphere cluster.
