Private cloud vSphere permission model
Google Cloud VMware Engine retains full administrative access to your private cloud
environment. You are granted sufficient administrator privileges to deploy and
manage the virtual machines (VMs) in your environment. If needed, you can
temporarily elevate your privileges to perform
advanced administrative functions.
CloudOwner user
When you create a private cloud, a default user, CloudOwner@gve.local is
created in the vCenter Single Sign-On domain and given Cloud-Owner-Role
access to manage objects in the private cloud.
vCenter roles
Roles in vCenter define a set of privileges that let a user perform certain
operations. When you create a private cloud, VMware Engine creates
a set of roles in vCenter and assigns those roles to user groups.
Roles that have a name containing "Global" apply at the level of the
vCenter object. All other roles apply at the level of Datacenter object
on vCenter.
vCenter user groups
Deploying a private cloud creates a group called Cloud-Owner-Group . Users in
this group can administer various aspects of the vSphere environment in the
private cloud. The Cloud-Owner-Group group is automatically given
Cloud-Owner-Role privileges, and the CloudOwner user is added as a member
of this group.
VMware Engine creates additional groups with limited privileges for
ease of management. You can add any user to these pre-created groups, and this
process assigns the corresponding privileges
to the user.
For information about granting individual user permissions or creating new user
groups, see Managing vSphere permissions .

Warning: New user groups must have permissions that are lower than
Cloud-Owner-Role . Groups with permissions higher than Cloud-Owner-Role
are automatically reset to Cloud-Owner-Role .
