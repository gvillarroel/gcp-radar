Compute best practices
This page presents compute best practices for Google Cloud VMware Engine.
Select the best region for your application
To pick the best region for your applications, consider the following factors:
To minimize network latency and improve the customer experience, select a
location that's closest to your users. The Google Cloud console provides a
real-time performance dashboard
that can help you visualize the latency both between regions and between
internet users and a Google Cloud region.
To maintain application performance, optimize the connectivity to
on-premises facilities by selecting the closest Google Cloud region.
For multicloud deployments, consider the proximity to the regions of other
cloud vendors.
To ensure that your applications maintain compliance with regulations,
such as Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance policies
or the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ,
select a region that supports those requirements.
Costs and pricing vary per region. Ensure that you account for these
regional differences when planning your deployment.
When selecting a location, some SKUs might be available only in some
regions and not in others.
Decide when to choose a multi-region design
In the following situations, you might want to deploy to multiple
VMware Engine private clouds across regions for the same workload or
project scope:
Disaster recovery implementations that use Site Recovery Manager (SRM)
or Zerto .
Applications that require global availability or low latency to their user
base.
Capacity planning requirements that are region specific.
Design for zone resilience
VMware Engine provides zone redundancy in specific regions. In these
regions, for increased fault tolerance, you can also deploy private clouds as a
stretched cluster .
For information about these regions, see the VMware Engine release notes .
When deployed as a stretch cluster, your private cloud has nodes in two
independent zones. You must have an equal number of nodes in each zone to
support this design. Such a design ensures application availability through
zone resilience and VMware vSphere High Availability .
When provisioning a stretched private cloud, VMs might run on both sides of a
stretched private cloud. Use
affinity rules
to control the placement of workload VMs on hosts within a cluster by grouping
them and pinning them to a site. Such a design assures zone resilience through
application high availability (HA).
Segregate environments across several private clouds
A private cloud is an independent VMware Cloud Foundation stack managed by a
vCenter Server.
You can segregate your VMware Engine footprint across multiple
private clouds. For example, use a dedicated vCenter Server in the following
cases:
For a specific workload type, such as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
When the limits of a private cloud
are inadequate
For licensing and software management
For cost transparency and simplicity
For monitoring
For compliance with regulatory requirements
For multi-tenancy at all layers, including management components and
infrastructure
To avoid the unnecessary proliferation of management endpoints, use only the
required number of private clouds.
Optimize the core count
VMware Engine lets you reduce the number of effective
CPU cores that are exposed to the ESXi hypervisor.
This might be desirable, or required, under some software license agreements.
Reducing the core count of the first cluster is not recommended because it
hosts key components, such as vCenter and NSX Manager.
Reducing the number of effective cores in a cluster does not change the cost of
running the cluster, specifically for Oracle workloads. For more information,
see the guidance regarding support and licensing .
For more information, see Custom core count limitations .
Add spare nodes for resilience
VMware Engine clusters should be sized to have at least one
spare node for resilience. This spare node is available to the cluster and can
provide additional capacity and resources during times of high load or
contention. These spare nodes are billed as part of the existing private cloud.
If higher reliability is required, consider adding more spare nodes to the
cluster to be available during maintenance windows. Scheduling workloads to run
on these spare nodes helps optimize the use of the clusters in private clouds.
Define the number of failures to tolerate
For VMware vSAN , use the
Failures to tolerate (FTT) attribute in vSAN storage policies
to define the number of failures that a cluster can tolerate without affecting
its data integrity or VM availability.
The higher the FTT value, the more the capacity hosts that are required.
