Elevate VMware Engine privileges
Google Cloud VMware Engine privileges give vCenter users the privileges they need to
perform normal operations. Some administrative functions require additional
privileges in the private cloud vCenter.
Google Cloud VMware Engine is now integrated with the Google Cloud console but the
integration does not provide the Elevate privilege feature. To perform
these tasks, you can use a solution user account to:
Configure identity sources
Perform user management
Delete a distributed port group
Create service accounts
Solution user accounts
Some tools and products used with your private cloud might require a user to
have administrative privileges in vSphere. When you create a private cloud,
VMware Engine also creates user accounts with administrative
privileges that you can use for the third-party tools and products. Multiple
solution user accounts are created for managing different applications. Using a
specific solution user account, you can audit the actions performed by each
application. This document provides you with guidance on managing these
solution user accounts in vSphere.
Here are some examples of tools and products that require administrative
privileges during setup:
VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM)
VMware Cloud Director
Zerto
Note: If you want to disable or re-enable all solution user accounts,
contact Cloud Customer Care .
Before you begin
Before signing in to a third-party tool or product with a solution user account,
confirm that the tool or product requires administrative privileges. If the tool
or product requires privileges that are already
provided by Cloud-Owner-Role , then create a new user
and add the user to Cloud-Owner-Group instead.
Caution: Solution user accounts have administrator privileges in vSphere. Only
use solution user accounts for their intended purpose. VMware Engine
reverts forbidden actions taken by these
accounts automatically because of their potential for adverse impact on your
private cloud.
You can use any of the following built-in solution user IDs:
solution-user-01@gve.local
solution-user-02@gve.local
solution-user-03@gve.local
solution-user-04@gve.local
solution-user-05@gve.local
Get a solution user password
To get a solution user password, take the following steps.
gcloud
gcloud vmware private-clouds vcenter credentials describe \
--private-cloud= PRIVATE_CLOUD_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--username= USERNAME_ID \
--location= ZONE
Replace the following:
PRIVATE_CLOUD_NAME : the private cloud for this
request
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request
USERNAME_ID : one of the solution user IDs
ZONE : the zone of the private cloud
API
In the REST API, make a GET request to the showVcenterCredentials method
and provide the provide the solution user ID:
https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_NAME :showVcenterCredentials?username= USERNAME_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request
ZONE : the zone of the private cloud
PRIVATE_CLOUD_NAME : the private cloud for this
request
USERNAME_ID : one of the solution user IDs
Reset solution user password
To reset a solution user password, take the following steps.
gcloud
gcloud vmware private-clouds vcenter credentials reset \
--private-cloud= PRIVATE_CLOUD_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--username= USERNAME_ID \
--location= ZONE
Replace the following:
PRIVATE_CLOUD_NAME : the private cloud for this
request
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request
USERNAME_ID : one of the solution user IDs
ZONE : the zone of the private cloud
API
In the REST API, make a POST request to the resetVcenterCredentials
method and provide the solution user ID in the request body:
https://vmwareengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /privateClouds/ PRIVATE_CLOUD_NAME :resetVcenterCredentials
{
"username": :" USERNAME_ID "
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project for this request
ZONE : the zone of the private cloud
USERNAME_ID : one of the solution user IDs
Forbidden actions
When VMware Engine detects any of the following forbidden actions,
VMware Engine reverts the changes to ensure that service remains
uninterrupted whenever possible. Performing a forbidden action can result in the
private cloud becoming inaccessible. Certain actions, like deleting management VMs, are irreversible. In such scenarios, VMware Engine support may recommend disaster recovery, or creating a new private cloud to recover your workload VMs from backup.
Caution: VMware Engine support team may not be able to help you
recover access to your private cloud if a forbidden action causes an issue.
Cluster actions
The following cluster actions are forbidden:
Removing a cluster from vCenter
Changing vSphere high availability (HA) on a cluster
Adding a host to the cluster from vCenter
Removing a host from the cluster from vCenter
Changing vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) on a cluster
Creating new Data Centers in VMware Engine
Host actions
The following host actions are forbidden:
Adding or removing datastores on an ESXi host; you can mount a temporary
disaster recovery datastore, but SLAs won't apply
Uninstalling vCenter agent from host
Modifying the host configuration
Making any changes to the host profiles
Placing a host in maintenance mode
Network actions
The following network actions are forbidden in vCenter Server:
Deleting the default distributed virtual switch (DVS) in a private cloud
Removing a host from the default DVS
Importing any DVS setting
Reconfiguring any DVS setting
Upgrading any DVS
Deleting the management portgroup
Editing the management portgroup
The following network actions are forbidden in NSX Manager:
Adding a new NSX Edge node
Changing an existing NSX Edge node
Roles and permissions actions
The following roles and permissions actions are forbidden:
Modifying or deleting permission to any management objects
Modifying or removing any default roles
Increase the privileges of a role to higher than of Cloud-Owner-Role
Adding users and groups to the Administrator group on vCenter
Adding any Active Directory users and groups to the Administrator group on vCenter
Other actions
The following actions are additionally forbidden:
Removing any default licenses:
vCenter Server
ESXi nodes
NSX
HCX
Modifying or deleting the management resource pool.
Cloning management VMs.
Deleting any management VMs.
Deleting any NSX-T Edge VMs.
Assigning a management network to a workload VM.
Using an IP address in the management internal IP address range for a workload
VM.
Renaming the data center.
Renaming the cluster.
Configuring Syslog forwarding using TLS protocol is not supported and is a
forbidden action.
Configuring syslog forwarding using the vCenter Server Appliance Management
Interface (VAMI).
Configuring syslog forwarding on ESXi Hosts directly using the vCenter user
interface. Instead, use the VMware Engine portal or the
Google Cloud CLI to configure syslog forwarding for
vCenter Server or ESXi Hosts.
Joining your private cloud vCenter to an Active Directory domain.
Resetting vCenter or NSX sign-in credentials using VMware tools, API calls,
or management appliances (vCenter/NSX manager). As a reminder, you can
retrieve or reset generated credentials ,
including password updates, from the private cloud details page in
the VMware Engine portal.
Changing statistics collection intervals or statistics levels in the vSphere
Client.
