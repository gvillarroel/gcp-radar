VMware Engine security overview
This page describes the security features VMware Engine uses to help
keep your data and environment secure. For a detailed list of what you, the
customer are responsible for and what Google is responsible for, see VMware Engine shared responsibility model .
Dedicated hardware
As part of the VMware Engine service, all customers get dedicated
bare metal hosts with local attached disks that are physically isolated from
other hardware. An ESXi hypervisor with vSAN runs on every node. The nodes are
managed through customer dedicated VMware vCenter and NSX. Not sharing hardware
between tenants provides an additional layer of isolation and security
protection.
Data security
Customers keep control and ownership of their data. Stewardship of customer data
is the responsibility of the customer.
Data protection for data at rest and data in transit within internal networks
Data at rest in the private cloud environment can be encrypted using vSAN
software based encryption. vSAN encryption relies on external Key Management
Solutions to store encryption keys.
VMware Engine enables vSAN data at rest encryption by default for any
new private clouds deployed, with key management infrastructure managed by
Google as part of the service. For details related to the default encryption
model, see About vSAN encryption .
If the KMS must be managed by users, you can optionally deploy external key
management infrastructure and configure it as a key provider in vCenter. For a
list of validated KMS providers, see
Supported vendors .
For data in transit, we expect applications to encrypt their network
communication within internal network segments. vSphere supports encryption of
data over the wire for vMotion traffic.
Data protection for data that is required to move through public networks
To protect data that moves through public networks, you can create IPsec and SSL
VPN tunnels for your private clouds. Common encryption methods are supported,
including 128-byte and 256-byte AES. Data in transit (including authentication,
administrative access, and customer data) is encrypted with standard encryption
mechanisms (SSH, TLS 1.2, and Secure RDP). Communication that transports
sensitive information uses the standard encryption mechanisms.
Secure disposal
If your service expires or is terminated, you are responsible for removing or
deleting your data. Google will cooperate with you to delete or return all
customer data as provided in the customer agreement, except to the extent that
Google is required by applicable law to retain some or all of the personal data.
If necessary to retain any personal data, Google will archive the data and
implement reasonable measures to prevent the customer data from any further
processing.
Erasure of customer data
Every time a VMware Engine node is taken out of a customer-provisioned
VMware cluster, the drives are erased to remove all customer data
present on the disk. This erasure is performed after the following actions:
deletion of a VMware Engine private cloud
deletion of a cluster within a private cloud
automated and manual removal of a node from a cluster
Hardware end of life
At the end of life of hardware, VMware Engine decommissions the
servers and takes them out of the production network. At that point, the drives
are physically destroyed according to Google security guidelines. This
destruction is in addition to the disk erasure described previously.
Data location
Your application data is located in the region you selected during the private
cloud creation. The service does not change the location of the data on its own
without specific customer action or trigger (for example, user-configured
replication to a private cloud in a different Google Cloud region). However, if
your use case requires, you can deploy your workloads across regions and
configure replication and data migration between regions.
Data backups
VMware Engine does not back up or archive customer application data
that resides within VMware virtual machines. VMware Engine
periodically backs up vCenter and NSX configuration. Prior to backup, all data
is encrypted at the source management server (for example, vCenter) using VMware
APIs. The encrypted backup data is transported and stored in Cloud Storage
buckets.
Network security
Google Cloud VMware Engine relies on layers of network security.
Edge security
The Google Cloud VMware Engine service runs within Google Cloud under the baseline
network security provided by Google Cloud. This applies to both the
VMware Engine application and the dedicated and private VMware
environment. Google Cloud provides built-in protection against
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. VMware Engine also
follows the defense-in-depth strategy for helping to secure the network edge by
implementing security controls like firewall rules and NAT.
Segmentation
VMware Engine has logically separate Layer 2 networks that restrict
access to your own internal networks in your private cloud environment. You can
further protect your private cloud networks by using a firewall. The
Google Cloud console lets you define rules for EW and NS network traffic controls
for all network traffic, including intra-private cloud traffic, inter-private
cloud traffic, general traffic to the internet, and network traffic to the
on-premises environment.
Vulnerability and patch management
Google is responsible for periodic security patching of managed VMware software
(ESXi, vCenter, and NSX).
Identity and Access Management
You can authenticate to Google Cloud console from Google Cloud using SSO.
You grant access to users to access Google Cloud console using IAM roles and
permissions .
By default, VMware Engine creates a user account for you in the
vCenter local domain of the private cloud. You can add new local users or
configure the vCenter to use an existing identity source. For this, add either
an existing on-premises identity source or a new identity source within the
private cloud.
The default user has sufficient privileges to perform necessary day-to-day
vCenter operations of the vCenter within the private cloud, but they don't have
full administrator access to vCenter. If administrator access is temporarily
required, you can elevate your privileges for a limited period of time while you
complete the administrator tasks.
Some third-party tools and products used with your private cloud might require a
user to have administrative privileges in vSphere. When you create a private
cloud, VMware Engine also creates
solution user accounts with administrative
privileges that you can use with the third-party tools and products.
Compliance
Google Cloud remains committed to continually expand our coverage against the
most important compliance standards. VMware Engine has achieved
ISO/IEC 27001 , 27017 , 27018 ;
PCI-DSS ; SOC 1 , SOC 2 , and SOC 3
compliance certifications, among others. Further, Google Cloud Business
Associate Agreement (BAA) also covers VMware Engine.
For assistance with auditing, contact your account representative for the latest
ISO certificates, SOC reports, and self assessments.
