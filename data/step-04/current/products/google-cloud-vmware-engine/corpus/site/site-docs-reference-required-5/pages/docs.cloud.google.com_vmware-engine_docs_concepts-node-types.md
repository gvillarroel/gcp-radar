VMware Engine node types
A Google Cloud VMware Engine private cloud is a collection of vSphere clusters created
with a set of dedicated isolated bare metal hardware nodes in a region. These
nodes provide the compute, memory, and storage required to run VMware ESXi, and
are the basic unit of consumption of Google Cloud VMware Engine. This document details the
node types, their resource capacity and availability in the regions.
VMware Engine supports private clouds with mixed node families ( ve1
and ve2 ) in some regions. While a private cloud can contain mixed node
families, each cluster within that private cloud must contain nodes of the same
type. For more information, see Region availability .
To create a new cluster of a different node family, contact Cloud Customer Care.
A vSphere cluster must have nodes with identical storage. Google Cloud VMware Engine
allows creation of a cluster with a mix of hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI)
and storage only node types from the same node family. You can create a
cluster with ve2-standard-128 and ve2-standard-so node types, but not mix
two different HCI node types in the same cluster.
Node types
The following sections list node types that are available when creating a
VMware Engine private clouds or clusters.

Node identification
Each VMware Engine private cloud has a nodeTypeId that's
available as soon as you create a VMware Engine private cloud. Retrieve
the nodeTypeId with the
projects.locations.nodeTypes.get
REST request.
Node billing
There are two options for paying for VMware Engine nodes: On-demand and
commitment. When you provision a VMware Engine node, you control the
VMs on that host. For more information about pricing, see VMware Engine pricing .
Node commitments
You can purchase VMware Engine nodes with a one- or three-year
committed use discount (CUD) where you make a fixed
monthly payment, or you can pay for nodes as you use them. Once you purchase a
CUD, you can't cancel it. For more information about pricing, see VMware Engine pricing .
Purchasing nodes as CAPEX or OPEX
Google does not provide guidance about accounting. Review the details about the
VMware Engine node product and seek guidance from your Controllership team and
auditors before you make any accounting decisions regarding CAPEX or OPEX.
Node maintenance
If a node fails, VMware Engine immediately and automatically adds a new
node to the affected VMware cluster to restore service operability. VMware Engine
also sends an email to the primary address notifying you about the replacement of
the failed node and the name of the private cloud. For more information about
maintenance, see Private cloud maintenance and updates .
