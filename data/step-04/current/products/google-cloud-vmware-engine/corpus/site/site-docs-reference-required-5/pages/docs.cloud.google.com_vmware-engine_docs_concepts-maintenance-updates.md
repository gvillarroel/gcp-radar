Private cloud maintenance and updates
Private cloud environments are designed in the following ways to have no single
point of failure:
ESXi clusters are configured with vSphere high availability (HA). Clusters
are sized to have at least one spare node for resiliency.
vSAN provides redundant primary storage, requiring at least three nodes to
provide protection against a single failure. For larger clusters, you can
configure vSAN to provide higher resiliency.
vCenter, PSC, and NSX Manager virtual machines (VMs) are configured with
RAID-10 storage to protect against storage failure. The VMs are additionally
protected against node and network failures by vSphere HA.
ESXi hosts have redundant fans and NICs.
TOR and spine switches are configured in HA pairs to provide resiliency.
VMware Engine continuously monitors uptime, monitors availability,
and provides availability SLAs for the following types of VMs:
ESXi hosts
vCenter
PSC
NSX Manager
VMware Engine continuously monitors the following for failures:
Hard disks
Physical NIC ports
Servers
Fans
Power
Switches
Switch ports
If a disk or node fails, VMware Engine immediately and automatically
adds a new node to the affected VMware cluster to restore service operability. The following processes take place on your private cloud:
Automated monitoring and alerting : Our monitoring system constantly
tracks the health of your nodes. When an issue is detected that indicates a
potential hardware failure, an alert is triggered.
Human-in-the-loop for diagnosis : While the system is designed for
automated replacement, our engineers review these alerts to quickly determine
the root cause. This ensures that we're addressing the
correct issue and prevents unnecessary node replacements when a simpler
solution (like a reboot) is recommended. For example, temporary network issues
or software glitches can trigger similar alerts to hardware failures, and we
want to avoid impacting your cluster with node replacement when it might not be
the recommended action. An unnecessary node replacement triggers a full vSAN
Resync, which is a storage I/O intensive operation.
Automated node replacement for hardware failures : If our engineers
confirm a hardware failure, the automated node replacement process begins
immediately. A new node is added to your cluster, and vSAN initiates the data resync
on that node.
The following VMware elements in private clouds are backed up, maintained, and
updated:
ESXi
vCenter Platform Services Controller
vSAN
NSX
Backup and restore
Backups include the following:
Nightly incremental backups of vCenter, PSC, and DVS rules.
vCenter built-in APIs to back up components at the application layer.
Automatic backup prior to update or upgrade of the VMware management
software.
Maintenance
The following types of planned maintenance are included.
Backend and internal maintenance
Backend and internal maintenance typically involves reconfiguring physical
assets or installing software patches. It doesn't affect normal consumption of
the assets being serviced. With redundant NICs going to each physical rack,
normal network traffic and private cloud operations aren't affected. You might
notice a performance impact only if your organization expects to use the full
redundant bandwidth during the maintenance interval.
Portal maintenance
Some limited service downtime is required when the control plane or
infrastructure is updated. Maintenance intervals can be as frequent as once per
month, and are expected to decline in frequency over time.
VMware Engine notifies you about impending portal maintenance and
makes an effort to keep the maintenance interval as short as possible. During a
portal maintenance interval, the following services continue to function without
any impact:
VMware management plane and applications
vCenter access
All networking and storage
VMware infrastructure maintenance
It's occasionally necessary to make changes to the configuration of the VMware
infrastructure. These intervals can occur every one to two months, but the
frequency is expected to decline over time. Google can usually perform this
type of maintenance, including certificate updates, without interrupting
normal private cloud consumption. During a VMware maintenance interval,
the following services continue to function without any impact:
VMware management plane and applications
vCenter access
All networking and storage
Updates and upgrades
VMware Engine is responsible for lifecycle management of VMware
software (ESXi, vCenter, PSC, and NSX) in private clouds.
Software updates include the following:
Patches: security patches or bug fixes released by VMware
Updates: minor version change of a VMware stack component
Upgrades: major version change of a VMware stack component
VMware Engine tests critical security patches as soon as they become
available from VMware. Google will aim to commence the rollouts of relevant
critical patches to private cloud environments within one week of their
availability. The actual patching completion timeline will vary depending on
scheduling availability and the need to time the patching to avoid any downtime
for customer workloads.
When a new major version of VMware software is available,
VMware Engine works with customers to coordinate a suitable
maintenance window for applying the upgrade. VMware Engine applies
major version upgrades at least six months after the major version is released
and notifies customers one month in advance of applying major version upgrades.
VMware Engine also works with key industry vendors to ensure that
they support the latest VMware software version before rolling out a major
version upgrade. For information about support for specific vendors, contact
Cloud Customer Care .
Certificate update responsibility
Certificate updates are a Google-owned responsibility. If you get a certificate
update error, no action is required and the certificate is renewed before
expiration. However, if LDAPS is configured in your private cloud, you are
solely responsible for the specific certificate associated with that error.
Certificate updates can occur during VMware infrastructure maintenance.
Preparation
Google recommends taking the following preparations before starting an update or
upgrade:
Check storage capacity: Ensure your vSphere cluster's storage space
utilization is lower than 80% to maintain the SLA . If the utilization
is higher than 80%, upgrades might take longer than normal or fail
completely. If your storage utilization is higher than 70%,
add a node to expand the cluster and avoid any potential
downtime during upgrades.
Change vSAN storage policies with FTT of 0: Change VMs configured with a
vSAN storage policy for Failures to Tolerate (FTT) of 0 to a vSAN storage
policy with FTT of 1 to maintain the SLA.
Remove VM CD mounts: Remove any CDs mounted on your workload VMs that
are not compatible with vMotion.
Complete VMware tool installations: Complete any installations or
upgrades of VMware tools before the scheduled upgrade begins.
Remove SCSI bus sharing on VMs: Remove SCSI bus sharing on VMs if you
don't want the VMs to be powered off.
Remove inaccessible VMs and datastores: Remove unused and inaccessible
VMs from the vCenter inventory. Remove any inaccessible external datastores.
Disable Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) rules: DRS rules that pin a
VM to a host prevent a node from entering maintenance mode. You can disable
the DRS rules before the upgrade and enable them after the upgrade is
complete.
Update VMware add-ons and third-party solutions: Verify that VMware
add-ons and third party solutions deployed on your private cloud vCenter are
compatible with the post-upgrade versions mentioned previously. Examples of
tools include those for backup, monitoring, disaster recovery orchestration,
and other similar functions. Check with the solution vendor and update ahead
of time if necessary to ensure compatibility after the upgrade.
Upgrade duration and background processes
The following factors can affect upgrade duration:
vSAN Resyncs : The duration of the upgrade process, specifically the
removal of temporary nodes, varies based on vSAN data resynchronization
requirements. vSAN resync and cluster rebalancing tasks might extend beyond
the designated maintenance window. These are expected background processes
and won't disrupt workload availability.
Underlying hardware issues : In rare cases, host reboots during the
upgrade might reveal underlying hardware faults. To maintain SLA and cluster
health, the system prioritizes replacing the faulty hardware before
proceeding. This necessary intervention might extend the overall upgrade
duration.
Configurations that might affect maintenance processes
VMware Engine leverages VMware's Maintenance Mode to carry out
upgrades, updates, and node maintenance. This helps ensure continued operation
of your Private Cloud workloads. However, the following configurations might
require additional steps before a node can enter Maintenance Mode:
DRS rules: MUST rules that force VMs to stay on a specific node.
SCSI bus sharing: VMs configured to share SCSI buses.
CD-ROM mounts: VMs with CD-ROMs attached, especially if those CD-ROMs
cannot be moved to another node using vMotion.
Serial port connections: VMs using serial port connections that prevent
them from being moved to another node using vMotion.
Raw device mappings (RDM): VMs directly accessing physical storage
devices.
Important: Proactively managing these configurations can help streamline future
VMware Engine maintenance procedures.
If action is necessary
If any of these configurations exist on a node, Cloud Customer Care notifies you
at least 24 hours before taking the remediation steps required to maintain the
availability of your Private Cloud. In some cases, steps such as powering off a
VM and moving it with vMotion and then powering it on, or removal of CD-ROMs,
might briefly disrupt your workload.
