This page describes how committed use discounts work with
Backup and DR for Oracle databases.
For other Backup and DR CUDs, see Committed use discounts for
Backup and DR for
VMware Engine .
What are Committed use discounts?
Committed use discounts (CUDs) provide deeply-discounted prices in exchange
for committing to continuously use Backup and DR for protecting
Oracle databases into a backup vault in a particular region for a
one- or three-year term.
CUDs are ideal for workloads with predictable resource needs.
You commit to a consistent amount of usage, measured in $ per hour of equivalent
on-demand spend, for a one- or three-year term. In exchange, you receive a
discounted rate on the applicable usage your commitment covers.
Important: This page explains the new and improved committed use discounts (CUDs) program,
which applies to any customers who purchase their first CUDs on or after
July 15, 2025 . For more information, see
Spend-based CUDs program improvements .
CUD pricing
Backup and DR for Oracle CUDs give you the following discounts on
on-demand pricing:
Workload
1 year in advance
1 year monthly
3 years in advance
3 years monthly
Oracle
N/A
24.4% ( consumption model ID AEA3-CEC2-9DF3)
N/A
42.5% ( consumption model ID 224F-258C-7F84)
Monthly charges are invoiced monthly for a one-year or a three-year
commitment
For a list of applicable SKUs for Oracle databases, see Backup and DR
CUD Eligible SKUs .
These discount percentages are the same in every region. See
Backup and DR pricing for examples
of pricing that include CUDs.
How do CUDs apply to Backup and DR for Oracle usage?
CUDs automatically apply to aggregate Oracle database protection into a backup
vault usage, giving you low, predictable costs, without the need to make any
manual changes or updates yourself. This flexibility saves you time and helps
you to save more by achieving high utilization rates across your commitments.
In Backup and DR for Oracle usage, your hourly commitment amount is
your CUD price minus promotional discounts.
Purchase commitments
To learn more about purchasing spend-based commitments, see the Google Cloud
Committed use discounts page.
You can purchase CUDs from any Cloud Billing account, and the discount
applies to any eligible usage in projects paid for by that Cloud Billing
account. Any overage is charged at the on-demand rate. Before you purchase a
commitment, read the
Service specific terms
regarding Committed Units.
Warning: After you purchase a committed use discount, you can't cancel it.
When you purchase a Backup and DR for Oracle CUD, you pay the same
commitment fee for the entirety of the commitment term, even if the price of
applicable usage changes. You still receive the same discount percentage on
applicable usage in the event of a price change. The commitment fee is billed
monthly.
To purchase or manage CUDs for a Cloud Billing account, follow the
instructions at
Purchasing spend-based commitments .
Hourly on-demand commitment
For Hourly on-demand commitment , you need to enter the on-demand price that
matches your planned usage. To calculate the value for the field for protecting
Oracle databases into a backup vault, multiply the number of GiB of source
(front-end) capacity under protection with the monthly price.
An example CUD scenario for Backup and DR for Oracle databases
Your commitment should represent your expected minimum hourly
expenditure on Backup and DR capacity across your projects
over the next one or three years.
As an example, say that you want to purchase a one-year commitment for Oracle
database protection into a backup vault for a 2000 GiB database.
From the pricing page , you can calculate
the approximate hourly one-year commitment cost as follows:
Expenditure for Oracle backups into a backup vault at ($0.000315068 per hour
24.4% discount) = $0.000238 per hour * 2000 GiB = $0.4764 per hour
If you expect to spend that minimum amount per hour continuously for
the next year or more, then you can make a commitment for that amount.
In other words, when purchasing that CUD, you would enter " $0.4764 " as
the hourly discounted commitment amount.
In the legacy CUDs program, your commitment amount is the on-demand price instead. For more
information about the differences between the legacy and new spend-based CUDs program, see
Spend-based CUDs program improvements .
If, on the other hand, you expect to scale down the capacity
occasionally, you can make a commitment for a lower amount. Any
expenditure greater than that limit is charged at the on-demand rate.
As a basis for comparison, compute the on-demand cost of Backup and DR
capacity, without the application of any commitment discounts:
Expenditure for Oracle backups into a backup vault at $0.000315068 per hour
(on-demand price) * 2000 GiB = $0.63 per hour * 730 = ~$460 per month.
From here, you can calculate the monthly costs and savings you would see under a
1-year CUD, applying its 24.4% discount, compared to a year of paying the full
on-demand rates:
Monthly cost of a 1-year, $0.4764/hour commitment: ($0.63 per hour - 24.4%
discount) * 730 hours = $347.77 per month
Total savings per month: ~$460 - $347.77 = ~$112.23 per month
Total savings with a 1-year, $0.4764/hour commitment: $112.23 per month * 12
months = $1346.76
You can apply similar math to calculating the costs and savings of a 3-year CUD,
with its 42.5% discount compared to on-demand rates:
Monthly cost of a 3-year, $0.362/hour commitment: ($0.63 per hour - 42.5%
discount) $0.3623 * 730 hours = ~$264.50 per month
Total savings per month: ~$460 - ~$264.50 = $195.50 per month
Total savings with a 3-year, $0.362/hour commitment: $195.50 per month * 36
months = $7,038
As you can see, a commitment that covers your expected minimum
Backup and DR usage over the years to come can lead to significant
savings.
