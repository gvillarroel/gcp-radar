On September 15, 2026 , all Cloud Composer 1 versions and versions 2.0.x of Cloud Composer 2 will reach their planned end of life . You will not be able to use environments with these versions. We recommend planning migration to Cloud Composer 3 . Cloud Composer 2 versions 2.1.x and later are still supported and are not impacted by this change.

Cloud Composer 3 | Cloud Composer 2 | Cloud Composer 1
This page shows how to implement an integrated monitoring dashboard for
multiple Cloud Composer environments across selected projects in
the same organization.
Overview
The described solution can help central enterprise platform teams support
Cloud Composer environments used by other teams. This
implementation can be used to monitor all Cloud Composer
environments, even those that are not created using Terraform.
This guide implements the Cloud Monitoring dashboard in
Cloud Composer along with alerting
policies that continuously report key metrics of Cloud Composer
environments and raise incidents in case of issues. The dashboard
automatically scans all Cloud Composer environments in projects
selected for this monitoring. The implementation relies on Terraform.
Note: Cloud Composer 1 environments do not provide several metrics and
corresponding alerts (as indicated further ) because of
architecture differences between Cloud Composer 2 and Cloud Composer 1.
The model uses a Google Cloud project acting as a
Monitoring Project, which is used to monitor (read-only)
Cloud Composer environments deployed in multiple Monitored
Projects. The central dashboard uses Cloud Monitoring metrics from the
Monitored Projects to render its contents.
The dashboard monitors and creates alerts for multiple metrics, including
environment health:
or CPU metrics:
Hold the pointer over a particular line to see which environment it represents.
The dashboard then displays a project name and resource:
In case a metric exceeds a predefined threshold, an incident is raised and a
respective alert is shown in a chart corresponding to this metric:
List of monitored metrics
A complete list of monitored metrics:
Cloud Composer environment health (based on Monitoring DAG)
Database health
Web Server Health
Scheduler Heartbeats
CPU and Memory utilization for all Workers
CPU and Memory utilization for the Airflow database
CPU and Memory utilization for the Web Server
(only available in Cloud Composer 2)
CPU and Memory utilization for Airflow Schedulers
Proportion of Queued, Scheduled, Queued or Scheduled tasks in an environment
(useful to spot Airflow concurrency configuration issues)
DAG Parsing time
Current versus minimal number of Workers - useful to understand Worker
stability issues or scaling problems
Worker Pod evictions
Number of errors thrown in Logs by Workers, Schedulers, Web Server or other
components (individual charts)
Note: You don't need to modify the dashboard when Cloud Composer
environments are added or removed as long as the list of monitored projects
stays the same.
Before you begin
To use Cloud Composer and Cloud Monitoring,
you need to create a Google Cloud project and enable billing.
The project must contain a Cloud Composer environment. This project is
referred to as the Monitoring Project in this guide.
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .

Install Terraform
if it is not already installed.
Configure the metrics scope of your project. By default, a project can
only display or monitor time-series data that it stores. If you want to
display data or to monitor data stored in multiple projects, then
configure the metrics scope of the project. For more information,
see Metrics scopes overview .
Implementation steps
On your local computer where you run Terraform, set the
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable
to the ID of your
Monitoring Project :
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT = MONITORING_PROJECT_ID
Make sure that your Terraform Google provider is authenticated and has
access to the following permissions:
roles/monitoring.editor permission in Monitoring Project
roles/monitoring.viewer , roles/logging.viewer in all
Monitored Projects
Copy the following main.tf file to the local computer where you run
Terraform.

# Monitoring for multiple Cloud Composer environments
#
# Usage:
# 1. Create a new project that you will use for monitoring of Cloud Composer environments in other projects
# 2. Replace YOUR_MONITORING_PROJECT with the name of this project in the "metrics_scope" parameter that is part of the "Add Monitored Projects to the Monitoring project" section
# 3. Replace the list of projects to monitor with your list of projects with Cloud Composer environments to be monitored in the "for_each" parameter of the "Add Monitored Projects to the Monitoring project" section
# 4. Set up your environment and apply the configuration following these steps: https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/basic-commands. Your GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable should be the new monitoring project you just created.
#
# The script creates the following resources in the monitoring project:
# 1. Adds monitored projects to Cloud Monitoring
# 2. Creates Alert Policies
# 3. Creates Monitoring Dashboard
