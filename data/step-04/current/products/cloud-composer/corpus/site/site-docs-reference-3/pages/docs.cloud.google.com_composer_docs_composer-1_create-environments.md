Cloud Composer 3 | Cloud Composer 2 | Cloud Composer 1
This page explains how to create a Cloud Composer environment.
For more information about environments, see Environment architecture .
For more information about creating an environment with Terraform, see Create environments (Terraform) .
Before you begin
Caution: It's no longer possible to create Cloud Composer 1 environments in
Google Cloud console . You can still create Cloud Composer 1 environments
through Google Cloud CLI, Terraform, and API if your project supports
creating new Cloud Composer 1 environments.
Enable the Cloud Composer API . For the full list
of services used by Cloud Composer, see
Services required by Cloud Composer .
The approximate time to create an environment is
25 minutes.
If you create an environment with Terraform, the service account used by
Terraform must have a role with
the composer.environments.create permission enabled.
For more information about the service account for Terraform, see
Google Provider Configuration Reference .
For more information about using Terraform to create a
Cloud Composer environment, see
Terraform documentation .
For more information about additional parameters, see
Terraform Argument Reference .
Private IP : There are specific network and peering requirements to
create a Private IP environment. For more information, see
Configuring private IP .
Shared VPC : There are specific network requirements to use Shared VPC
with Cloud Composer. For information, see
Configuring shared VPC .
VPC SC : To deploy Cloud Composer environments inside a security
perimeter, see Configuring VPC SC . When used with
Cloud Composer, VPC Service Controls have several
known limitations .
Important: For production use cases, we highly recommend to use
highly resilient environments . The Airflow database
of your environment is zonal. During a zonal outage, Airflow tasks that are
executed in the affected zone are interrupted and marked as failed by Airflow.
Highly resilient environments are more resilient to this issue, because their
databases are located in two separate zones.
Step 1. Create or choose an environment's service account
When you create an environment, you specify a service account. This service
account is called environment's service account . Your environment uses this
service account to perform most of the operations.
The service account for your environment is not a user account. A
service account is a special kind of account used by an application or a
virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person.
You can't change the service account of your environment later.
Warning: Your environment's service account can have
too broad permissions on your project . Because your environment runs DAGs on
behalf of your environment's service account, users who can add and modify DAGs
in your environment's bucket
can run their code on behalf of the environment's service account and
exercise all permissions of this account . Make sure that you are familiar
with
security considerations for environment's service accounts
and understand how this account interacts with permissions and roles that you
grant to individual users in your project.
If you don't have a service account for Cloud Composer
environments in your project yet, create it.
See Create environments (Terraform) for an
extended example of creating a service account for your environment in
Terraform.
Important: You can use the same service account for more than one
Cloud Composer environment. In this case, if you grant extra
permissions to access resources in your project to this account, all
environments that use it will get the same permissions.
To create a new service account for your environment:
Create a new service account as described in
the Identity and Access Management documentation.
Grant a role to it , as described in the Identity and Access Management
documentation. The required role is Composer Worker ( composer.worker ).
If your environment
uses resource location restrictions ,
or installs PyPI packages
from an Artifact Registry repository or
from a private repository , then grant
the Service Account User ( iam.serviceAccountUser ) role to the
user-managed service account that runs your environment on itself
(both the principal and the resource are the same service account).
To access other resources in your Google Cloud project, grant
extra permissions to access those resources to this service account.
The Composer Worker ( composer.worker ) role provides this required
set of permissions in most cases. Add extra permissions to this service
account only when it's necessary for the operation of your DAGs.
Step 2. Basic setup
This step creates a Cloud Composer environment with default
parameters in the specified location.
Note: All other steps in this guide explain how to customize and configure
different aspects of your environment. All of the remaining steps are optional.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create environment page.
Go to Create environment
In the Name field, enter a name for your environment.
The name must start with a lowercase letter followed by up to 62 lowercase
letters, numbers, or hyphens, and can't end with a hyphen. The environment
name is used to create subcomponents for the environment, so you must provide
a name that is also valid as a Cloud Storage
bucket name. See Bucket naming guidelines for a list
of restrictions.
In the Location drop-down list, choose a location
for your environment.
A location is the region where the environment is located.
In the Image version drop-down list, select
a Cloud Composer image with the required
version of Airflow.
In
in the Node configuration section, in the
Service account drop-down list,
select a service account for your environment.
If you don't have a service
account for your environment yet, see
Create or choose an environment's service account .
gcloud
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \

Important:
You must specify an image version for Cloud Composer 1. By default,
Cloud Composer API uses the default image for
Cloud Composer 2.
Replace:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME with the name of the environment.
The name must start with a lowercase letter followed by up to 62 lowercase
letters, numbers, or hyphens, and can't end with a hyphen. The environment

}
node_config {
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Step 3. (Optional) Configure environment scale and performance parameters
To specify the scale and performance configuration for your environment,
provide the number of nodes in your environment's GKE cluster
and select machine types for environment components.
Console
On the Create environment page:
In the Node configuration section:
Enter the Node count .
Node count is the number of Google Kubernetes Engine nodes in the environment's cluster.
By default, environments have 3 nodes.
You can change this value after you create your environment.
Choose Machine type for nodes.
The machine type for nodes is
Compute Engine machine type
used for cluster instances. This parameter determines the number of CPUs and
the amount of memory for your environment. The default machine type is
n1-standard-1 .
To change this value after you create your environment, you must
manually reconfigure the environment cluster .
Enter the Disk size .
The disk size, in GB, for environment nodes. Each node in your environment has
this amount of disk space. Select a larger disk size if you expect to store a
large volume of data in folders that are synchronized with environment VMs.
For example, in the /data folder of your environment's bucket.
The minimum size is 30 GB. The default size is 100 GB. You can't
change this parameter after you create an environment.
Choose the Number of schedulers .
Your environment can run more than one Airflow scheduler at the same
time. Use multiple schedulers to distribute load between several
scheduler instances for better performance and reliability.
Increasing the number of schedulers does not always improve Airflow
performance. For example, having only one scheduler might provide better
performance than having two. This might happen when the extra scheduler is not
utilized, and thus consumes resources of your environment without contributing
to overall performance. The actual scheduler performance depends on the
number of Airflow workers, the number of DAGs and tasks that run in your
environment, and the configuration of both Airflow and the environment.
We recommend starting with two schedulers and then monitoring the performance
of your environment. If you change the number of schedulers, you can always
scale your environment back to the original number of schedulers.
For more information about configuring multiple schedulers, see
Airflow documentation .
Expand the Networking, Airflow config overrides, and additional features item.
In the Cloud SQL configuration section, choose
Cloud SQL machine type .
This parameter determines the machine type for the
Cloud SQL instance that runs the Airflow
database. The default Cloud SQL machine type is db-n1-standard-2 .
In the Web server configuration section, choose
Web server machine type .
This parameter determines the machine type for the
Compute Engine instance that runs the Airflow web
server.
The default web server machine type is composer-n1-webserver-2 .
gcloud
When you create an environment, following arguments control environment
scale and performance parameters:
--node-count specifies the number of nodes in your environment.
Node count is the number of Google Kubernetes Engine nodes in the environment's cluster.
By default, environments have 3 nodes.
You can change this value after you create your environment.
--scheduler-count specifies the number of schedulers in your environment.
Your environment can run more than one Airflow scheduler at the same
time. Use multiple schedulers to distribute load between several
scheduler instances for better performance and reliability.
Increasing the number of schedulers does not always improve Airflow
performance. For example, having only one scheduler might provide better
performance than having two. This might happen when the extra scheduler is not
utilized, and thus consumes resources of your environment without contributing
to overall performance. The actual scheduler performance depends on the
number of Airflow workers, the number of DAGs and tasks that run in your
environment, and the configuration of both Airflow and the environment.
We recommend starting with two schedulers and then monitoring the performance
of your environment. If you change the number of schedulers, you can always
scale your environment back to the original number of schedulers.
For more information about configuring multiple schedulers, see
Airflow documentation .
--disk-size specifies the disk size for environment VMs.
The disk size, in GB, for environment nodes. Each node in your environment has
this amount of disk space. Select a larger disk size if you expect to store a
large volume of data in folders that are synchronized with environment VMs.
For example, in the /data folder of your environment's bucket.
The minimum size is 30 GB. The default size is 100 GB. You can't
change this parameter after you create an environment.
--machine-type specifies the machine type for node VMs.
The machine type for nodes is
Compute Engine machine type
used for cluster instances. This parameter determines the number of CPUs and
the amount of memory for your environment. The default machine type is
n1-standard-1 .
To change this value after you create your environment, you must
manually reconfigure the environment cluster .
--cloud-sql-machine-type specifies the machine type for
the Cloud SQL instance.
This parameter determines the machine type for the
Cloud SQL instance that runs the Airflow
database. The default Cloud SQL machine type is db-n1-standard-2 .
--web-server-machine-type specifies the machine type for the Airflow web
server instance.
This parameter determines the machine type for the
Compute Engine instance that runs the Airflow web
server.
The default web server machine type is composer-n1-webserver-2 .
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \

Terraform
When you create an environment, following fields control environment scale
and performance parameters:
node_count in the node_config block specifies the number of nodes in
your environment.
Node count is the number of Google Kubernetes Engine nodes in the environment's cluster.
By default, environments have 3 nodes.
You can change this value after you create your environment.
disk_size_gb in the node_config block specifies the disk size for
environment VMs.
The disk size, in GB, for environment nodes. Each node in your environment has
this amount of disk space. Select a larger disk size if you expect to store a
large volume of data in folders that are synchronized with environment VMs.
For example, in the /data folder of your environment's bucket.
The minimum size is 30 GB. The default size is 100 GB. You can't
change this parameter after you create an environment.
machine_type in the node_config block specifies the machine type for
node VMs. When you specify this field, also provide
a Compute Engine zone for your
environment VMs in the zone field.
The machine type for nodes is
Compute Engine machine type
used for cluster instances. This parameter determines the number of CPUs and
the amount of memory for your environment. The default machine type is
n1-standard-1 .
To change this value after you create your environment, you must
manually reconfigure the environment cluster .
machine_type in the database_config block specifies the machine type
for the Cloud SQL instance.
This parameter determines the machine type for the
Cloud SQL instance that runs the Airflow
database. The default Cloud SQL machine type is db-n1-standard-2 .
machine_type in the web_server_config block specifies the machine type
for the Airflow web server instance.
This parameter determines the machine type for the
Compute Engine instance that runs the Airflow web
server.
The default web server machine type is composer-n1-webserver-2 .
scheduler_count field in the software_config block specifies the
number of schedulers in your environment. Your environment must use
Airflow 2.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
node_config {
node_count = NODE_COUNT
disk_size_gb = DISK_SIZE
machine_type = " NODE_MACHINE_TYPE "
zone = " NODE_ZONE "
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
software_config {
scheduler_count = SCHEDULER_COUNT
}
database_config {
machine_type = " SQL_MACHINE_TYPE "
}
web_server_config {
machine_type = " WS_MACHINE_TYPE "
}
}
}
Replace:
NODE_COUNT with the number of nodes.

machine_type = "db-n1-standard-2"
}
web_server_config {
machine_type = "composer-n1-webserver-2"
}
}
}
Step 4. (Optional) Configure your environment's networking
Networking parameters depend on the type of environment that you want to
create:
Public IP environment . Use the default networking parameters.
Private IP environment (VPC peerings) . In this configuration, your
environment uses VPC peerings for connectivity.
Note: Cloud Composer 1 supports only private IP environments with VPC
peerings. Cloud Composer 2 environments can use both VPC peerings and
Private Service Connect for connectivity in Private IP.
Configure your Private IP environment:
Configure your project's networking for Private IP environments .
Specify other parameters for your Private IP environment, as described
further in this section.
For a Private IP environment with VPC peerings, you need to know:
Your VPC network ID
Your VPC subnetwork ID
Two secondary IP ranges in your VPC subnetwork:
Secondary IP range for pods
Secondary IP range for services
IP ranges for the components of the environment:
IP range for the GKE control plane.
Web server IP range.
IP range for the Cloud SQL instance.
For a Shared VPC environment , you must do additional networking setup for
the host project, then create a Public or a Private IP environment in a
service project. Follow the instructions on the
Configuring Shared VPC page.
Important: If you create an environment in the service project using
Google Cloud console, then your account must have
the compute.subnetworks.use permission in the host project.
Otherwise, the list of available subnetworks does not contain subnetworks
from the host project. If you create an environment using gcloud , API,
or Terraform, then your account does not need this additional permission.
For a Shared VPC environment, you need to know:
Your host project VPC network ID
Your host project VPC subnetwork ID
Two secondary IP ranges in your host project VPC subnetwork:
Secondary IP range for pods
Secondary IP range for services
When creating a Public IP Shared VPC environment , you still need to
specify your host project VPC network, subnetwork, and secondary IP ranges
for pods and services.
To create a VPC SC environment , you must create a service perimeter and
then create Private IP environments inside this perimeter. Follow the
instructions outlined in Configuring VPC Service Controls .
Additional networking options for environments are:
Privately used public IP addresses . If you want to use more IP
addresses, your environment can
privately use certain public IP address ranges as internal,
subnet IP address ranges for pods and services.
Authorized networks . If you want to access the control plane of your
Private IP environment using HTTPS, you can use
authorized networks to specify CIDR ranges that can do so.
IP Masquerade agent . By using environments with the IP Masquerade
agent, you can use many-to-one IP address translations in your
environment's networking configurations. For more information about
creating environments with IP Masquerade agent, see
Enable the IP Masquerade agent .
Console
To create a Private IP environment:
Make sure that your networking is configured for the type of environment that you want to create.
Expand the Networking, Airflow config overrides, and additional features item.
In the Network configuration section, select the Enable VPC-native (using alias-IP) checkbox.
In the Network drop-down list, select your VPC network ID.
In the Subnetwork drop-down list, select your VPC subnetwork ID.
In the Pod IP Address Allocation section, specify the secondary IP range for pods. You can use an existing secondary range in your VPC network, or specify a new one in the CIDR notation.
In the Service IP Address Allocation section, specify the secondary IP range for services. You can use an existing secondary range in your VPC network, or specify a new one in the CIDR notation.
In the Private IP section, select the Enable private IP checkbox.
In the GKE cluster master private IP section, specify an IP range for the GKE control plane:
To use the default IP range for the region where your environment is located, select Default IP range .
To specify a custom IP range, select Custom IP range and enter a range in the CIDR notation in the GKE cluster master private IP field.
Select the level access for the GKE control plane. The control plane has two endpoints. One endpoint is private, for use by cluster nodes and VMs. Another endpoint is public. You can specify the level of access for the public endpoint:
To enable access to the public endpoint from authorized networks, select the Access master endpoint using its external IP address checkbox.
Using this option sets the level of access for the control plane to "Public endpoint access enabled, authorized networks enabled" . This provides restricted access to the control plane from authorized networks. By default, no source IP addresses are specified. You can add authorized networks to the cluster .
To disable access to the public endpoint from authorized networks, clear the Access master endpoint using its external IP address checkbox.
Using this option sets the level of access for the control plane to "Public endpoint access disabled" . This prevents all internet access to the control plane.
In the Web Server private IP section, specify an IP range for the Airflow web server instance.
In the Cloud SQL private IP section, specify an IP range for
the Cloud SQL instance.
Caution: The 172.17.0.0/16 range
is reserved in Cloud SQL .
gcloud
Make sure that your networking is configured for the type of environment that you want to create.
When you create an environment, the following arguments control
the networking parameters. If you omit a parameter, the default value is
used.
--enable-private-environment enables a Private IP environment.
--enable-ip-alias enables VPC Native using alias IP
addresses.
This parameter is required when using --enable-private-environment or
when configuring secondary ranges for pods and services.
--network specifies your VPC network ID.
--subnetwork specifies your VPC subnetwork ID.
--cluster-secondary-range-name or --cluster-ipv4-cidr configures the
the secondary range for pods.
--services-secondary-range-name or --services-ipv4-cidr to configure
the secondary range for services.
--master-ipv4-cidr specifies a range for the GKE
control plane.
--web-server-ipv4-cidr specifies a range for the Airflow web server
instance.
--cloud-sql-ipv4-cidr specifies a range for the Cloud SQL
instance.
--enable-private-endpoint controls the level access for
the GKE control plane. The control plane has two
endpoints. One endpoint is private, for use by cluster nodes and VMs.
Another endpoint is public. You can specify the level of access for the
public endpoint:
To enable access to the public endpoint from authorized networks, omit the --enable-private-endpoint argument.
Using this option sets the level of access for the control plane to "Public endpoint access enabled, authorized networks enabled" . This provides restricted access to the control plane from authorized networks. By default, no source IP addresses are specified. You can add authorized networks to the cluster .
To disable access to the public endpoint from authorized networks, specify the --enable-private-endpoint argument.
Using this option sets the level of access for the control plane to "Public endpoint access disabled" . This prevents all internet access to the control plane.
--enable-master-authorized-networks and --master-authorized-networks
arguments configure authorized networks
for your environment.
--enable-privately-used-public-ips configures
privately used public IP addresses for your environment.
--enable-ip-masq-agent
enables the IP Masquerade agent .
Example (Private IP environment
)
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--enable-private-environment \
--enable-ip-alias \
--network NETWORK_ID \
--subnetwork SUBNETWORK_ID \
--cluster-ipv4-cidr PODS_RANGE \
--services-ipv4-cidr SERVICES_RANGE \
--master-ipv4-cidr CONTROL_PLANE_RANGE \
--web-server-ipv4-cidr WEB_SERVER_RANGE \
--cloud-sql-ipv4-cidr SQL_RANGE
Replace:
NETWORK_ID with your VPC network ID.
SUBNETWORK_ID with your VPC subnetwork ID.
PODS_RANGE with the secondary range for pods.
SERVICES_RANGE with the secondary range for services.
CONTROL_PLANE_RANGE with the secondary range for the GKE
control plane.
WEB_SERVER_RANGE with the secondary range for the Airflow web server
instance.
SQL_RANGE with the range for the Cloud SQL instance.
Caution: The 172.17.0.0/16 range
is reserved in Cloud SQL .
Step 5. (Optional) Add network tags
Network tags are applied to all node VMs in your environment's
cluster. Tags are used to identify valid sources or targets for network
firewalls. Each tag within the list must comply with
RFC 1035 .
For example, you might want to add network tags if you plan to restrict
traffic for a Private IP environment with firewall rules.
Caution: You can't change network tags later. If you want to later configure
firewall rules that target only VMs in your environment's cluster, specify
network tags when you create your environment.
Console
On the Create environment page:
Locate the Node configuration section.
In the Tags field, specify instance tags for node VMs.
gcloud
When you create an environment, following arguments control network tags:
--tags specifies a comma-separated list of network tags applied to all
node VMs.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--tags TAGS
Replace:
TAGS with a comma-separated list of network tags.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--tags group1,production
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, specify
network tags for your environment.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"nodeConfig" : {
"tags" : [
" TAG "
],
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
TAG with a network tag.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"nodeConfig" : {
"tags" : [
"group1" ,
"production"
],
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, following fields define network tags for
your environment:
tags field in the node_config block specifies a comma-separated list
of network tags applied to all node VMs.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
node_config {
tags = [ " TAGS " ]
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
TAGS with a comma-separated list of network tags.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
node_config {
tags = [ "group1","production" ]
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Step 6. (Optional) Configure web server network access
The Airflow web server access parameters do not depend on the type of your
environment. Instead, you can configure web server access separately. For
example, a Private IP environment can still have the Airflow UI accessible
from the internet.
You can't configure the allowed IP ranges using private IP addresses.
Console
On the Create environment page, in the Web server configuration
section:
To provide access to the Airflow web server from all IP addresses,
select Allow access from all IP addresses .
To restrict access only to specific IP ranges, select
Allow access only from specific IP addresses . In the IP range
field, specify an IP range in the CIDR notation. In the Description
field, specify an optional description for this range. If you want to
specify more than one range, click Add IP range .
To forbid access for all IP addresses, select Allow access only from
specific IP addresses and click Delete item next to the empty range
entry.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
gcloud
When you create an environment, following arguments control web server
access level:
--web-server-allow-all provides access to Airflow from all IP addresses.
This is the default option.
--web-server-allow-ip restricts access only to specific source IP
ranges. To specify several IP ranges, use this argument multiple times.
--web-server-deny-all forbids access for all IP addresses.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--web-server-allow-ip ip_range = WS_IP_RANGE ,description = WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION
Replace:
WS_IP_RANGE with the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access
Airflow UI.
WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION with the description of the IP range.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--web-server-allow-ip ip_range = 192 .0.2.0/24,description = "office net 1" \
--web-server-allow-ip ip_range = 192 .0.4.0/24,description = "office net 3"
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, specify web server
access parameters.
To provide access to the Airflow web server from all IP addresses,
omit webServerNetworkAccessControl .
To restrict access only to specific IP ranges, specify one or more ranges
in allowedIpRanges .
To forbid access for all IP addresses, add allowedIpRanges and make it an
empty list. Do not specify IP ranges in it.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"webServerNetworkAccessControl" : {
"allowedIpRanges" : [
{
"value" : " WS_IP_RANGE " ,
"description" : " WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION "
}
]
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
WS_IP_RANGE with the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access
Airflow UI.
WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION with the description of the IP range.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"webServerNetworkAccessControl" : {
"allowedIpRanges" : [
{
"value" : "192.0.2.0/24" ,
"description" : "office net 1"
},
{
"value" : "192.0.4.0/24" ,
"description" : "office net 3"
}
]
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, the allowed_ip_range block in the
web_server_network_access_control block contains IP ranges that can access
web server.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
web_server_network_access_control {
allowed_ip_range {
value = " WS_IP_RANGE "
description = " WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION "
}
}
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
WS_IP_RANGE with the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access
Airflow UI.
WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION with the description of the IP range.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
web_server_network_access_control {
allowed_ip_range {
value = "192.0.2.0/24"
description = "office net 1"
},
allowed_ip_range {
value = "192.0.4.0/24"
description = "office net 3"
}
}
node_config {
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
Step 7. (Optional) Specify Airflow configuration overrides and environment variables
You can set up Airflow configuration overrides and
environment variables when you create an environment. As an
alternative, you can do it later, after your environment is created.
Some Airflow configuration options are blocked and you
can't override them.
For the list of available Airflow configuration options, see
Configuration reference for Airflow 2
and Airflow 1.10.*
To specify Airflow configuration overrides and environment variables:
Console
On the Create environment page:
Expand the Networking, Airflow config overrides, and additional features item.
In the Environment variables section, click
Add environment variable .
Enter the Name and Value for the environment variable.
In the Airflow configuration overrides section, click
Add Airflow configuration override .
Enter the Section , Key , and Value for the configuration
option override.
For example:
Section
Key
Value
webserver
dag_orientation
TB
gcloud
When you create an environment, following arguments control environment
variables and Airflow configuration overrides:
--env-variables specifies a comma-separated list of environment
variables.
Variable names may contain upper and lowercase letters, digits, and
underscores, but they may not begin with a digit.
--airflow-configs specifies a comma-separated list of keys and values
for Airflow configuration overrides.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--env-variables ENV_VARS \
--airflow-configs CONFIG_OVERRIDES
Replace:
ENV_VARS with a list of comma-separated NAME=VALUE pairs for
environment variables.
CONFIG_OVERRIDES with a list of comma-separated SECTION-KEY=VALUE
pairs for configuration overrides. Separate the name of the
configuration section with a - symbol, followed by the key name. For
example: core-dags_are_paused_at_creation .
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--env-variables SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM = user@example.com,SENDGRID_API_KEY = example-key \
--airflow-configs core-dags_are_paused_at_creation = True,webserver-dag_orientation = TB
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, specify
environment variables and Airflow configuration overrides.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"softwareConfig" : {
"airflowConfigOverrides" : {
" SECTION - KEY " : " OVERRIDE_VALUE "
},
"envVariables" : {
" VAR_NAME " : " VAR_VALUE " ,
}
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
SECTION with the section in the configuration file where the Airflow
configuration option is located.
KEY with the name of the Airflow configuration option.
OVERRIDE_VALUE with a value of the Airflow configuration option.
VAR_NAME with the name of the environment variable.
VAR_VALUE with the value of the environment variable.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"softwareConfig" : {
"airflowConfigOverrides" : {
"core-dags_are_paused_at_creation" : "True" ,
"webserver-dag_orientation" : "TB"
},
"envVariables" : {
"SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM" : "user@example.com" ,
"SENDGRID_API_KEY" : "example-key"
}
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, following blocks control environment
variables and Airflow configuration overrides:
env_variables block in the software_config block specifies
environment variables.
Variable names may contain upper and lowercase letters, digits, and
underscores, but they may not begin with a digit.
airflow_config_overrides block in the software_config block specifies
Airflow configuration overrides.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
software_config {
airflow_config_overrides = {
SECTION - KEY = " OVERRIDE_VALUE "
}
env_variables = {
VAR_NAME = " VAR_VALUE "
}
}
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
SECTION with the section in the configuration file where the Airflow
configuration option is located.
KEY with the name of the Airflow configuration option.
OVERRIDE_VALUE with a value of the Airflow configuration option.
VAR_NAME with the name of the environment variable.
VAR_VALUE with the value of the environment variable.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
software_config {
airflow_config_overrides = {
core-dags_are_paused_at_creation = "True"
webserver-dag_orientation = "TB"
}
env_variables = {
SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM = "user@example.com"
SENDGRID_API_KEY = "example-key"
}
}
node_config {
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Step 8. (Optional) Specify maintenance windows
By default, Cloud Composer 1 environments do not have defined
maintenance windows if you create them using
Google Cloud console, API, or Terraform. We recommend to specify
maintenance windows for your new and existing environments.
If you create your environment using gcloud CLI, your environment
has default maintenance windows from 00:00:00 to 04:00:00 (GMT) on Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday every week.
To specify custom maintenance windows for your environment:
Console
On the Create environment page:
Expand the Networking, Airflow config overrides, and additional features item.
In the Maintenance windows section, select the
Set custom time for maintenance windows checkbox.
In the Timezone drop-down list, choose a time zone for maintenance
windows.
Set Start time , Days , and Length , so that
combined time for the specified schedule is at least 12 hours in a 7-day
rolling window. For example, a period of 4 hours every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday provides the required amount of time.
gcloud
The following arguments define maintenance windows parameters:
--maintenance-window-start sets the start time of a maintenance
window.
--maintenance-window-end sets the end time of a maintenance window.
--maintenance-window-recurrence sets
the maintenance window recurrence .
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--maintenance-window-start ' DATETIME_START ' \
--maintenance-window-end ' DATETIME_END ' \
--maintenance-window-recurrence ' MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE '
Replace:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME with the name of the environment.
DATETIME_START with the start date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the specified time of
the day is used, the specified date is ignored.
DATETIME_END with the end date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the specified time of
the day is used, the specified date is ignored. The specified date and
time must be after the start date.
MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE with
an RFC 5545 RRULE for maintenance
windows recurrence. Cloud Composer supports two formats:
The FREQ=DAILY format specifies a daily recurrence.
The FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA format specifies a
recurrence on selected days of the week.
The following example specifies a 6-hour maintenance window between 01:00 and
07:00 (UTC) on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The 1 January, 2023
date is ignored.
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--maintenance-window-start '2023-01-01T01:00:00Z' \
--maintenance-window-end '2023-01-01T07:00:00Z' \
--maintenance-window-recurrence 'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,WE,SA'
API
When you create an environment, in the
Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, specify
maintenance windows parameters:
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"maintenanceWindow" : {
"startTime" : " DATETIME_START " ,
"endTime" : " DATETIME_END " ,
"recurrence" : " MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE "
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
DATETIME_START with the start date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the
specified time of the day is used, the specified date is ignored.
DATETIME_END with the end date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the
specified time of the day is used, the specified date is ignored. The
specified date and time must be after the start date.
MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE with an RFC 5545 RRULE for maintenance windows
recurrence. Cloud Composer supports two formats:
The FREQ=DAILY format specifies a daily recurrence.
The FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA format specifies a
recurrence on selected days of the week.
The following example specifies a 6-hour maintenance window between 01:00 and
07:00 (UTC) on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The 1 January, 2023
date is ignored.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"maintenanceWindow" : {
"startTime" : "2023-01-01T01:00:00Z" ,
"endTime" : "2023-01-01T07:00:00Z" ,
"recurrence" : "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,WE,SA"
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Terraform
The maintenance_window block specifies the maintenance windows for your
environment:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
maintenance_window {
start_time = " DATETIME_START "
end_time = " DATETIME_END "
recurrence = " MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE "
}
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
DATETIME_START with the start date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the
specified time of the day is used, the specified date is ignored.
DATETIME_END with the end date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the
specified time of the day is used, the specified date is ignored. The
specified date and time must be after the start date.
MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE with an RFC 5545 RRULE for maintenance windows
recurrence. Cloud Composer supports two formats:
The FREQ=DAILY format specifies a daily recurrence.
The FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA format specifies a
recurrence on selected days of the week.
The following example specifies a 6-hour maintenance window between 01:00 and
07:00 (UTC) on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The 1 January, 2023
date is ignored.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
maintenance_window {
start_time = "2023-01-01T01:00:00Z"
end_time = "2023-01-01T07:00:00Z"
recurrence = "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,WE,SA"
}
}
}
Step 9. (Optional) Configure data encryption (CMEK)
By default, data in your environment is encrypted with a key provided by
Google.
To use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) to encrypt data in your
environment, follow the instructions outlined in
Using customer-managed encryption keys .
Step 10. (Optional) Specify environment labels
You can assign labels to your environments to
break down billing costs based on these labels .
Console
On the Create environment page:
Expand the Networking, Airflow config overrides, and additional features item.
In the Labels section, click Add label .
In Key and Value fields, specify key and value pairs for the
environment labels.
gcloud
When you create an environment, the --labels argument specifies a comma-separated list of keys and values with environment labels.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--labels LABELS
Replace:
LABELS with a list of comma-separated KEY=VALUE pairs for environment
labels.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--labels owner = engineering-team,env = production
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment
resource, specify labels for your environment.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"labels" : {
" LABEL_KEY " : " LABEL_VALUE "
}
}
Replace:
LABEL_KEY with a key of the environment label.
LABEL_VALUE with a value of the environment label.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"labels" : {
"owner" : "engineering-team" ,
"env" : "production"
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, specify labels in the labels block (
outside of the config block).
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
labels = {
LABEL_KEY = " LABEL_VALUE "
}
}
Replace:
LABEL_KEY with a key of the environment label.
LABEL_VALUE with a value of the environment label.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
labels = {
owner = "engineering-team"
env = "production"
}
}
Step 11. (Optional) Configure other parameters
Other parameters include:
Zone for your environment nodes
Compute Engine zone in which to deploy cluster nodes. In this
parameter, you can select a specific zone in the location of your
environment.
By default, a random zone is selected automatically.
OAuth scopes
OAuth scopes are a set of Google API scopes to be made
available on all node VMs. If empty, defaults to
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform .
If you specify custom OAuth scopes, include
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform in the list of specified
scopes.
Python version
If your environment uses Airflow 1.10.* and earlier Airflow versions, you
can make your environment use Python 2. The default Python version is
Python 3. For more information about Python 2 support in
Cloud Composer, see Supported Python versions .
Console
On the Create environment page:
In the Node configuration section:
In the Zone drop-down list, select a zone for your environment
nodes.
You can't change zone later.
In the OAuth Scopes field, specify OAuth scopes for node VMs.
You can't change OAuth scopes later.
To specify several OAuth scopes, provide a comma-separated list of
values. Include https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
in the list of specified scopes.
In the Python version field, choose the version of Python.
You can't change the Python version later.
gcloud
When you create an environment, following arguments control miscellaneous
parameters of your environment:
--zone specifies a Compute Engine zone for your environment
VMs.
--oauth-scopes specifies a comma-separted list of OAuth scopes.
Include https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
in the list of specified scopes.
--python-version specifies the version of Python.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \

When you create an environment, following fields control miscellaneous
parameters of your environment:
zone field in the node_config block specifies a Compute Engine
zone for your environment VMs.
oauth_scopes field in the node_config block specifies a comma-separated
list of OAuth scopes.
python_version field in the software_config block specifies the
version of Python.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
node_config {
zone = " ZONE "
oauth_scopes = "[ OAUTH_SCOPES ]"
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
software_config {
python_version = " PYTHON_VERSION "
}
}
}
Replace:
ZONE with the name of the Compute Engine zone.
OAUTH_SCOPES with a comma-separated list of OAuth scopes.
PYTHON_VERSION with the Python version ( 3 or 2 ).
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
node_config {
zone = "us-central1-a"
oauth_scopes = "[https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery]"
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
software_config {
python_version = "3"
}
}
}
