On September 15, 2026 , all Cloud Composer 1 versions and versions 2.0.x of Cloud Composer 2 will reach their planned end of life . You will not be able to use environments with these versions. We recommend planning migration to Cloud Composer 3 . Cloud Composer 2 versions 2.1.x and later are still supported and are not impacted by this change.

Cloud Composer 3 | Cloud Composer 2 | Cloud Composer 1
Apache Airflow has a REST API interface that you can use to perform tasks such
as getting information about DAG runs and tasks, updating DAGs, getting
Airflow configuration, adding and deleting connections, and listing users.
For an example of using Airflow REST API with Cloud Run functions, see
Triggering DAGs with Cloud Run functions .
Airflow REST API versions
Airflow 1 uses the experimental REST API .
Airflow 2 uses the stable REST API .
The experimental REST API is deprecated by Airflow.
You can still use the experimental REST API in Airflow 2 if you enable it
through an Airflow configuration override, as described further.
Configure the stable Airflow REST API
Airflow 2
The stable REST API is enabled by default in Airflow 2.
Cloud Composer uses its own
API authentication backend ,
which is integrated with Identity-Aware Proxy.
Authorization works in the standard way provided by Airflow. When a new user
authorizes through the API, the user's account gets the Op role by default.
You can enable or disable the stable REST API, or change the default user
role by overriding the following Airflow configuration
options:
Section
Key
Value
Notes
api
(Airflow 2.2.5 and earlier) auth_backend
(Airflow 2.3.0 and later) auth_backends
airflow.composer.api.backend.composer_auth
To disable the stable REST API, change to
airflow.api.auth.backend.deny_all
api
composer_auth_user_registration_role
Op
You can specify any other role .
Airflow 1
The stable REST API is not available in Airflow 1. You can use
the experimental REST API instead.
Configure the experimental Airflow REST API
Airflow 2
By default, the API authentication feature is disabled in the experimental
API. The Airflow web server denies all requests to it. To enable the API
authentication feature and the Airflow 2 experimental API,
override the following Airflow configuration option:
Section
Key
Value
Notes
api
(Airflow 2.2.5 and earlier) auth_backend
(Airflow 2.3.0 and later) auth_backends
airflow.api.auth.backend.default
The default is airflow.composer.api.backend.composer_auth .
api
enable_experimental_api
True
The default is False .
Airflow 1
Note: This section applies to Cloud Composer versions that use
Airflow 1.10.12 and later . If your environment uses Airflow 1.10.10 and
earlier versions, the experimental REST API is enabled by default.
By default, the API authentication feature is disabled in Airflow 1.10.11 and
later versions. The Airflow web server denies all requests that you make. You
use requests to trigger DAGs, so enable this feature.
To enable the API authentication feature in Airflow 1,
override the following Airflow configuration option:
Section
Key
Value
Notes
api
auth_backend
airflow.api.auth.backend.default
The default is airflow.api.auth.backend.deny_all
After you set this configuration option to
airflow.api.auth.backend.default , the Airflow web server accepts all API
requests without authentication.
Even though the Airflow web server itself doesn't require authentication,
Cloud Composer uses its own authentication layer to protect
it, which is integrated with Identity-Aware Proxy.
Allow API calls to Airflow REST API using web server access control
Depending on the method used to call Airflow REST API, the caller method
can use either IPv4 or IPv6 address . Remember to unblock the
IP traffic to Airflow REST API using
web server access control .
Use the default configuration option which is
All IP addresses have access (default) if you are not sure from which IP
addresses your calls to Airflow REST API will be sent.
Make calls to Airflow REST API
Get the client_id of the IAM proxy
To make a request to the Airflow REST API endpoint,
the function requires the client ID of the IAM proxy that
protects the Airflow web server.
Cloud Composer does not provide this information directly. Instead,
make an unauthenticated request to the Airflow web server and capture the
client ID from the redirect URL:
cURL
curl -v AIRFLOW_URL 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -o "client_id\=[A-Za-z0-9-]*\.apps\.googleusercontent\.com"
Replace AIRFLOW_URL with the URL of the Airflow web interface.
In the output, search for the string following client_id . For example:
client_id= 836436932391-16q2c5f5dcsfnel77va9bvf4j280t35c.apps.googleusercontent.com
Python
Save the following code in a file called get_client_id.py . Fill in your
values for project_id , location , and composer_environment , then run
the code in Cloud Shell or your local environment.
# This script is intended to be used with Composer 1 environments

Make the following replacements:

ID, which is a part of the Airflow web interface URL before
.appspot.com . You obtained the Airflow web interface URL on a
previous step.
Specify the Airflow REST API version that you use:
If you use the stable Airflow REST API, set the USE_EXPERIMENTAL_API

If you use the experimental Airflow REST API, no changes are needed. The
USE_EXPERIMENTAL_API variable is already set to True .

Access Airflow REST API using a service account
Note: If your environment uses Airflow 1, then this section only applies if
Airflow UI Access Control is enabled in your environment.
Otherwise, Airflow does not perform its own user management.
The Airflow database in Airflow versions before 2.3.0 limits the length of the
email field to 64 characters. Service accounts sometimes have email addresses
that are longer than 64 characters. It is not possible to create Airflow users
for such service accounts in the usual way. If there is no Airflow user for
such a service account, then accessing the Airflow REST API results in HTTP
errors 401 and 403.
Note: Errors 401 (Unauthorized) and 403 (Forbidden) are generic HTTP errors. If
you still get these errors after using the described workaround, then check for
other possible causes. For example, IAM roles might be missing
on the service account. To allow a service account to access the Airflow REST
API, grant an IAM role that
allows accessing the web interface .
As a workaround, you can preregister an Airflow user for a service account. To
do so, use accounts.google.com:NUMERIC_USER_ID as the username, and any
unique string as the email.
To get NUMERIC_USER_ID for a service account, run:
gcloud iam service-accounts describe \
SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--format = "value(oauth2ClientId)"
Replace:
SA_NAME with the service account name.
PROJECT_ID with the Project ID .
Create an Airflow user with the Op role for the service account:
Airflow UI
Go to the Airflow UI .
Go to Admin > Users and click Create . Your
Airflow user must have the Admin role to open this page.
Specify accounts.google.com: NUMERIC_USER_ID as the user
name. Replace NUMERIC_USER_ID with the user ID obtained on the
previous step.
Specify a unique identifier as the email. You can use any
unique string.
Specify the role for the user. For example, Op .
Make sure that Is Active? checkbox is selected.
Specify the first and the last name for the user. You can use any
string.
Click Save .
gcloud
Note: In Cloud Composer environments with Airflow 1, you
cannot run Airflow CLI commands that create users through gcloud . You
can use the Airflow UI.
In Airflow 2, run the following Airflow CLI command:
gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
users create -- \
-u accounts.google.com: NUMERIC_USER_ID \
-e UNIQUE_ID \
-f UNIQUE_ID \
-l - -r Op --use-random-password
Replace:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME with the name of the environment.
LOCATION with the region where the environment is located.
NUMERIC_USER_ID with the user ID obtained in the previous step.
UNIQUE_ID with the identifier for the Airflow user. You can use any
unique string.
After you create an Airflow user for a service account, a caller
authenticated as the service account is recognized as a pre-registered user,
and is logged into Airflow.
Scaling the Airflow REST API component
Airflow REST API and Airflow UI endpoints are run within the Airflow web
server. If you use REST API intensively, consider increasing the amount of CPU
and memory available to the Airflow web server, based on the expected load.
