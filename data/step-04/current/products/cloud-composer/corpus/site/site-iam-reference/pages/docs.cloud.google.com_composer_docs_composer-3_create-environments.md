Cloud Composer 3 | Cloud Composer 2 | Cloud Composer 1
This page explains how to create a Cloud Composer environment.
For more information about environments, see Environment architecture .
For more information about creating an environment with Terraform, see Create environments (Terraform) .
Before you begin
Enable the Cloud Composer API . For the full list
of services used by Cloud Composer, see
Services required by Cloud Composer .
The approximate time to create an environment is
25 minutes.
If you create an environment with Terraform, the service account used by
Terraform must have a role with
the composer.environments.create permission enabled.
For more information about the service account for Terraform, see
Google Provider Configuration Reference .
For more information about using Terraform to create a
Cloud Composer environment, see
Terraform documentation .
For more information about additional parameters, see
Terraform Argument Reference .
VPC SC : To deploy Cloud Composer environments inside a security
perimeter, see Configuring VPC SC . When used with
Cloud Composer, VPC Service Controls have several
known limitations .
Important: For production use cases, we highly recommend to use
highly resilient environments . The Airflow database
of your environment is zonal. During a zonal outage, Airflow tasks that are
executed in the affected zone are interrupted and marked as failed by Airflow.
Highly resilient environments are more resilient to this issue, because their
databases are located in two separate zones.
Step 1. Create or choose an environment's service account
When you create an environment, you specify a service account. This service
account is called environment's service account . Your environment uses this
service account to perform most of the operations.
The service account for your environment is not a user account. A
service account is a special kind of account used by an application or a
virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person.
You can't change the service account of your environment later.
Warning: Your environment's service account can have
too broad permissions on your project . Because your environment runs DAGs on
behalf of your environment's service account, users who can add and modify DAGs
in your environment's bucket
can run their code on behalf of the environment's service account and
exercise all permissions of this account . Make sure that you are familiar
with
security considerations for environment's service accounts
and understand how this account interacts with permissions and roles that you
grant to individual users in your project.
If you don't have a service account for Cloud Composer
environments in your project yet, create it.
See Create environments (Terraform) for an
extended example of creating a service account for your environment in
Terraform.
Important: You can use the same service account for more than one
Cloud Composer environment. In this case, if you grant extra
permissions to access resources in your project to this account, all
environments that use it will get the same permissions.
To create a new service account for your environment:
Create a new service account as described in
the Identity and Access Management documentation.
Grant a role to it , as described in the Identity and Access Management
documentation. The required role is Composer Worker ( composer.worker ).
To access other resources in your Google Cloud project, grant
extra permissions to access those resources to this service account.
The Composer Worker ( composer.worker ) role provides this required
set of permissions in most cases. Add extra permissions to this service
account only when it's necessary for the operation of your DAGs.
Step 2. Basic setup
This step creates a Cloud Composer environment with default
parameters in the specified location.
Note: All other steps in this guide explain how to customize and configure
different aspects of your environment. All of the remaining steps are optional.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create environment page.
Go to Create environment
In the Name field, enter a name for your environment.
The name must start with a lowercase letter followed by up to 62 lowercase
letters, numbers, or hyphens, and can't end with a hyphen. The environment
name is used to create subcomponents for the environment, so you must provide
a name that is also valid as a Cloud Storage
bucket name. See Bucket naming guidelines for a list
of restrictions.
In the Location drop-down list, choose a location
for your environment.
A location is the region where the environment is located.
In the Image version drop-down list, select
a Cloud Composer image with the required
version of Airflow.
In
the Service account drop-down list,
select a service account for your environment.
If you don't have a service
account for your environment yet, see
Create or choose an environment's service account .
gcloud
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \

}
}
}
Step 3. (Optional) Configure environment scale and performance parameters
To specify the scale and performance configuration for your environment,
select the environment size and workloads configuration.
You can change all performance and scale parameters
after you create an environment.
Following parameters control the scale and performance:
Environment size . Controls the performance parameters of the managed
Cloud Composer infrastructure that includes the Airflow
database. Consider selecting a larger environment size if you want to run a
large number of DAGs and tasks with higher infrastructure performance. For
example, larger environment's size increases the amount of Airflow task log
entries that your environment can process with minimal delay.
Workloads configuration . Controls the scale and performance of Airflow
components that run in a GKE cluster of your environment.
Airflow scheduler . Parses DAG definition files, schedules DAG runs
based on the schedule interval, and queues tasks for execution by
Airflow workers.
Your environment can run more than one Airflow scheduler at the same
time. Use multiple schedulers to distribute load between several
scheduler instances for better performance and reliability.
Increasing the number of schedulers does not always improve Airflow
performance. For example, having only one scheduler might provide better
performance than having two. This might happen when the extra scheduler is not
utilized, and thus consumes resources of your environment without contributing
to overall performance. The actual scheduler performance depends on the
number of Airflow workers, the number of DAGs and tasks that run in your
environment, and the configuration of both Airflow and the environment.
We recommend starting with two schedulers and then monitoring the performance
of your environment. If you change the number of schedulers, you can always
scale your environment back to the original number of schedulers.
For more information about configuring multiple schedulers, see
Airflow documentation .
Airflow triggerer . Asynchronously monitors all deferred tasks in your
environment. If you have at least one triggerer instance in your
environment (or at least two in highly resilient environments), you can
use deferrable operators in your DAGs .
In Cloud Composer 3, the Airflow triggerer is enabled by default. If you
want to create an environment without a triggerer, set the number of
triggerers to zero.
Airflow DAG processor . Processes DAG files and turns them into
DAG objects. In Cloud Composer 3, this part of the scheduler runs as a
separate environment component.
Airflow web server . Runs the Airflow web interface where you can
monitor, manage, and visualize your DAGs.
Airflow workers . Execute tasks that are scheduled by Airflow
schedulers. The minimum and maximum number of workers in your
environment changes dynamically depending on the number of tasks in the
queue.
Note: When configuring resource limits for Airflow components, make sure that
the limits exceed the minimum resource requirements for your usage scenario.
Sidecar containers that run alongside the main
Airflow component's container utilize some of the allocated resources.
Console
You can select a preset for your environment. When you select a preset, the
scale and performance parameters for that preset are automatically selected.
You also have an option to select a custom preset and specify all scale and
performance parameters for your environment.
To select the scale and performance configuration for your environment, on
the Create environment page:
To use predefined values, in the Environment resources section, click
Small , Medium , Large , or
Extra Large .
To specify custom values for the scale and performance parameters:
In the Environment resources section, click Custom .
In the Scheduler section, set the number of schedulers you want to
use, and the resource allocation for their CPU, memory, and storage.
In the Triggerer section, use the Number of triggerers field
to enter the number of triggerers in your environment.
If you don't want to
use deferrable operators in your DAGs ,
set the number of triggerers to zero.
If you set at least one triggerer for your environment, use the
the CPU , and Memory fields to configure resource allocation
for your triggerers.
In the DAG processor section, specify the number of DAG processors
in your environment and the amount of CPUs, memory, and storage for
each DAG processor.
Highly resilient environments require at least two DAG processors.
In the Web server section, specify the amount of CPUs, memory, and
storage for the web server.
In the Worker section, specify:
The minimum and maximum number of workers for autoscaling limits in
your environment.
The CPU, memory, and storage allocation for your workers
In the Core infrastructure section, in the Environment size
drop-down list, select the environment size.
gcloud
When you create an environment, the following arguments control the
scale and performance parameters of your environment.
Note: If you omit an argument, Cloud Composer uses the default
value.
--environment-size specifies the environment size.
--scheduler-count specifies the number of schedulers.
--scheduler-cpu specifies the number of CPUs for an Airflow scheduler.
--scheduler-memory specifies the amount of memory for an Airflow
scheduler.
--scheduler-storage specifies the amount of disk space for an Airflow
scheduler.
--triggerer-count specifies the number of Airflow triggerers in your
environment. The default value for this flag is 0 .
You need triggerers if you want to
use deferrable operators in your DAGs .
For standard resilience environments, use a value between 0 and
10 .
For highly resilient environments, use 0 or a value between
2 and 10 .
--triggerer-cpu specifies the number of CPUs for an Airflow
triggerer, in vCPU units. Allowed values: 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 . The default
value is 0.5 .
--triggerer-memory specifies the amount of memory for an
Airflow triggerer, in GB. The default value is 0.5 .
The minimum required memory is equal to the number of CPUs allocated for
the triggerers. The maximum allowed value is equal to the number of
triggerer CPUs multiplied by 6.5.
For example, if you set the --triggerer-cpu flag to 1 , the
minimum value for --triggerer-memory is 1 and the
maximum value is 6.5 .
--dag-processor-count specifies the number of DAG processors in your
environment.
Highly resilient environments require at least two DAG processors.
--dag-processor-cpu specifies the number of CPUs for the DAG processor.
--dag-processor-memory specifies the amount of memory for the DAG
processor.
--dag-processor-storage specifies the amount of disk space for the DAG
processor.

server.
--web-server-storage specifies the amount of disk space for the Airflow
web server.
--worker-cpu specifies the number of CPUs for an Airflow worker.
--worker-memory specifies the amount of memory for an Airflow worker.
--worker-storage specifies the amount of disk space for an Airflow
worker.

}
}
environment_size = "ENVIRONMENT_SIZE_SMALL"
node_config {
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Step 4. (Optional) Enable high resilience mode
Highly resilient (Highly Available)
Cloud Composer environments are environments that use built-in
redundancy and failover mechanisms that reduce the environment's susceptibility
to zonal failures and single point of failure outages.
In Cloud Composer 3, highly resilient environments are available starting
from Airflow builds composer-3-airflow-2.10.2-build.13 and
composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.20.
Important: We strongly recommend to
use highly resilient environments for production use cases .
A highly resilient environment is multi-zonal and runs across at
least two zones of a selected region. The following components run in separate
zones:
Exactly two Airflow schedulers
At least two triggerers
( if the number of triggerers isn't set to 0 )
At least two DAG processors
Two web servers
The minimum number of workers is set to two, and your environment's cluster
distributes worker instances between zones. In case of a zonal outage, affected
worker instances are rescheduled in a different zone. The Cloud SQL
component of a highly resilient environment has a primary instance and a standby
instance that are distributed between zones.
Console
On the Create environment page:
In the Resilience mode section, select High resilience .
In the Environment resources section, select scale parameters for a
highly resilient environment. Highly resilient environments require
exactly two schedulers, zero or between two and ten triggerers, and at least two workers:
Click Custom .
In the Number of schedulers drop-down list, select 2 .
In the Number of triggerers drop-down list, select 0 ,
or a value between 2 and 10 . Configure the CPU and Memory
allocation for your triggerers.
In the Minimum number of workers drop-down list, select 2 or
more, depending on the required number of workers.
In the Network configuration section:
In the Networking type , select Private IP environment .
If required, specify other networking parameters .
gcloud
When you create an environment, the --enable-high-resilience argument
enables the high resilience mode.
Set the following arguments:
--enable-high-resilience
--enable-private-environment , and
other networking parameters for a Private IP environment,
if required
--scheduler-count to 2
--triggerer-count to 0 or a value between 2 and 10 .
If you use triggerers, the --triggerer-cpu and --triggerer-memory`
flags are also required for environment creation.
For more information about --triggerer-count , --triggerer-cpu , and
--triggerer-memory flags, see
Configure environment scale and performance parameters .
--min-workers to 2 or more
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--enable-high-resilience \
--enable-private-environment \
--scheduler-count 2 \
--triggerer-count 2 \
--triggerer-cpu 0 .5 \
--triggerer-memory 0 .5 \
--min-workers 2
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, enable the high
resilience mode.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"resilience_mode" : "HIGH_RESILIENCE" ,
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"resilience_mode" : "HIGH_RESILIENCE" ,
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
Note: An update to the resilience mode field causes a failure instead of
leading to recreating the Cloud Composer environment.
When you create an environment, the resilience_mode field in the config
block enables the high resilience mode.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
resilience_mode = "HIGH_RESILIENCE"
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
resilience_mode = "HIGH_RESILIENCE"
node_config {
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Step 5. (Optional) Specify a zone for the environment's database
You can specify a preferred Cloud SQL zone when creating a standard
resilience environment.
Note: If your environment uses high resilience mode ,
you can't specify a zone for the database. Instead, Cloud Composer
automatically selects two zones in the region where the environment is located.
If you enable high resilience for an existing environment with the preferred
Cloud SQL zone, the preferred zone configuration is removed and two
zones are selected automatically.
Console
On the Create environment page:
In the Advanced configuration section, expand
the Show advanced configuration item.
In the Airflow database zone list, select a preferred
Cloud SQL zone.
gcloud
When you create an environment, the --cloud-sql-preferred-zone argument
specifies a preferred Cloud SQL zone.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--cloud-sql-preferred-zone SQL_ZONE
Replace the following:
SQL_ZONE : preferred Cloud SQL zone. This zone must be located
in the region where the environment is located.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--cloud-sql-preferred-zone us-central1-a
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment
> DatabaseConfig resource, specify the
preferred Cloud SQL zone.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"databaseConfig" : {
"zone" : " SQL_ZONE "
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace the following:
SQL_ZONE : preferred Cloud SQL zone. This zone must be located
in the region where the environment is located.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"databaseConfig" : {
"zone" : "us-central1-a"
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, the zone field in the database_config
block specifies the preferred Cloud SQL zone.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
database_config {
zone = " SQL_ZONE "
}
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace the following:
SQL_ZONE : preferred Cloud SQL zone. This zone must be located
in the region where the environment is located.
Step 6. (Optional) Configure your environment's networking
You can configure Cloud Composer 3 networking in the following ways:
In a Public IP environment , your environment's Airflow components can
access the internet.
In a Private IP environment , your environment's Airflow components do not
have access to the internet.
Private IP and Public IP environments can
connect to your VPC network as a separate option.
You can specify the
internal IP range of your environment . This range can't be changed later.
You can
enable access to the internet when installing PyPI packages .
For example, your Private IP environment can
still install PyPI packages from
Python Package Index if you enable this
option.
For a Shared VPC environment , you must do additional networking setup for
the host project, then create a Public or a Private IP environment in a
service project. Follow the instructions on the
Configuring Shared VPC page.
Console
Make sure that your networking is configured for the type of environment
that you want to create.
In the Network configuration section, expand
the Show network configuration item.
If you want to connect your environment to a VPC network, in the
Network attachment field, select a network attachment. You can also
create a new network attachment. For more information, see
Connect an environment to a VPC network .
If you want to create a Private IP environment, in the Networking type
section, select the Private IP environment option.
If you want to add network tags, see Add network tags for
more information.
gcloud
Make sure that your networking is configured for the type of environment that you want to create.
When you create an environment, the following arguments control
the networking parameters. If you omit a parameter, the default value is
used.
--enable-private-environment enables a Private IP environment.
--network specifies your VPC network ID.
--subnetwork specifies your VPC subnetwork ID.
--composer-internal-ipv4-cidr-block specifies the
environment's internal IP range .
This range is used by Cloud Composer in the
tenant project of your environment.
Example (Private IP environment
with a connected VPC network)
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--enable-private-environment \
--network NETWORK_ID \
--subnetwork SUBNETWORK_ID \
Replace:
NETWORK_ID with your VPC network ID.
SUBNETWORK_ID with your VPC subnetwork ID.
Step 7. (Optional) Add network tags
Network tags are applied to all node VMs in your environment's
cluster. Tags are used to identify valid sources or targets for network
firewalls. Each tag within the list must comply with
RFC 1035 .
For example, you might want to add network tags if you plan to restrict
traffic for a Private IP environment with firewall rules.
Caution: You can't change network tags later. If you want to later configure
firewall rules that target only VMs in your environment's cluster, specify
network tags when you create your environment.
Console
On the Create environment page:
Locate the Network configuration section.
In the Network tags field, enter network tags for your environment.
gcloud
When you create an environment, following arguments control network tags:
--tags specifies a comma-separated list of network tags applied to all
node VMs.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--tags TAGS
Replace:
TAGS with a comma-separated list of network tags.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--tags group1,production
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, specify
network tags for your environment.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"nodeConfig" : {
"tags" : [
" TAG "
],
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
TAG with a network tag.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"nodeConfig" : {
"tags" : [
"group1" ,
"production"
],
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, following fields define network tags for
your environment:
tags field in the node_config block specifies a comma-separated list
of network tags applied to all node VMs.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
node_config {
tags = [ " TAGS " ]
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
TAGS with a comma-separated list of network tags.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
node_config {
tags = [ "group1","production" ]
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Step 8. (Optional) Configure web server network access
The Airflow web server access parameters do not depend on the type of your
environment. Instead, you can configure web server access separately. For
example, a Private IP environment can still have the Airflow UI accessible
from the internet.
You can't configure the allowed IP ranges using private IP addresses.
Caution: In some cases, changes to the web server access parameters can take up
to 10 minutes to propagate.
Console
On the Create environment page:
In the Network configuration section, expand the Show network
configuration item.
In the Web server network access control section:
To provide access to the Airflow web server from all IP addresses,
select Allow access from all IP addresses .
To restrict access only to specific IP ranges, select
Allow access only from specific IP addresses . In the IP range
field, specify an IP range in the CIDR notation. In
the Description field, specify an optional description for this
range. If you want to specify more than one range, click Add IP
range .
To forbid access for all IP addresses, select Allow access only from
specific IP addresses and click Delete item next to the empty
range entry.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
gcloud
When you create an environment, following arguments control web server
access level:
--web-server-allow-all provides access to Airflow from all IP addresses.
This is the default option.
--web-server-allow-ip restricts access only to specific source IP
ranges. To specify several IP ranges, use this argument multiple times.
--web-server-deny-all forbids access for all IP addresses.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--web-server-allow-ip ip_range = WS_IP_RANGE ,description = WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION
Replace:
WS_IP_RANGE with the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access
Airflow UI.
WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION with the description of the IP range.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--web-server-allow-ip ip_range = 192 .0.2.0/24,description = "office net 1" \
--web-server-allow-ip ip_range = 192 .0.4.0/24,description = "office net 3"
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, specify web server
access parameters.
To provide access to the Airflow web server from all IP addresses,
omit webServerNetworkAccessControl .
To restrict access only to specific IP ranges, specify one or more ranges
in allowedIpRanges .
To forbid access for all IP addresses, add allowedIpRanges and make it an
empty list. Do not specify IP ranges in it.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"webServerNetworkAccessControl" : {
"allowedIpRanges" : [
{
"value" : " WS_IP_RANGE " ,
"description" : " WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION "
}
]
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
WS_IP_RANGE with the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access
Airflow UI.
WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION with the description of the IP range.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"webServerNetworkAccessControl" : {
"allowedIpRanges" : [
{
"value" : "192.0.2.0/24" ,
"description" : "office net 1"
},
{
"value" : "192.0.4.0/24" ,
"description" : "office net 3"
}
]
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, the allowed_ip_range block in the
web_server_network_access_control block contains IP ranges that can access
web server.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
web_server_network_access_control {
allowed_ip_range {
value = " WS_IP_RANGE "
description = " WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION "
}
}
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
WS_IP_RANGE with the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access
Airflow UI.
WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION with the description of the IP range.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
web_server_network_access_control {
allowed_ip_range {
value = "192.0.2.0/24"
description = "office net 1"
},
allowed_ip_range {
value = "192.0.4.0/24"
description = "office net 3"
}
}
node_config {
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
Step 9. (Optional) Specify Airflow configuration overrides and environment variables
You can set up Airflow configuration overrides and
environment variables when you create an environment. As an
alternative, you can do it later, after your environment is created.
Some Airflow configuration options are blocked and you
can't override them.
For the list of available Airflow configuration options, see
Configuration reference for Airflow 2
and Airflow 1.10.*
To specify Airflow configuration overrides and environment variables:
Console
On the Create environment page:
In the Environment variables section, click
Add environment variable .
Enter the Name and Value for the environment variable.
In the Airflow configuration overrides section, click
Add Airflow configuration override .
Enter the Section , Key , and Value for the configuration
option override.
For example:
Section
Key
Value
webserver
dag_orientation
TB
gcloud
When you create an environment, following arguments control environment
variables and Airflow configuration overrides:
--env-variables specifies a comma-separated list of environment
variables.
Variable names may contain upper and lowercase letters, digits, and
underscores, but they may not begin with a digit.
--airflow-configs specifies a comma-separated list of keys and values
for Airflow configuration overrides.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--env-variables ENV_VARS \
--airflow-configs CONFIG_OVERRIDES
Replace:
ENV_VARS with a list of comma-separated NAME=VALUE pairs for
environment variables.
CONFIG_OVERRIDES with a list of comma-separated SECTION-KEY=VALUE
pairs for configuration overrides. Separate the name of the
configuration section with a - symbol, followed by the key name. For
example: core-dags_are_paused_at_creation .
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--env-variables SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM = user@example.com,SENDGRID_API_KEY = example-key \
--airflow-configs core-dags_are_paused_at_creation = True,webserver-dag_orientation = TB
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, specify
environment variables and Airflow configuration overrides.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"softwareConfig" : {
"airflowConfigOverrides" : {
" SECTION - KEY " : " OVERRIDE_VALUE "
},
"envVariables" : {
" VAR_NAME " : " VAR_VALUE " ,
}
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
SECTION with the section in the configuration file where the Airflow
configuration option is located.
KEY with the name of the Airflow configuration option.
OVERRIDE_VALUE with a value of the Airflow configuration option.
VAR_NAME with the name of the environment variable.
VAR_VALUE with the value of the environment variable.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"softwareConfig" : {
"airflowConfigOverrides" : {
"core-dags_are_paused_at_creation" : "True" ,
"webserver-dag_orientation" : "TB"
},
"envVariables" : {
"SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM" : "user@example.com" ,
"SENDGRID_API_KEY" : "example-key"
}
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, following blocks control environment
variables and Airflow configuration overrides:
env_variables block in the software_config block specifies
environment variables.
Variable names may contain upper and lowercase letters, digits, and
underscores, but they may not begin with a digit.
airflow_config_overrides block in the software_config block specifies
Airflow configuration overrides.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
software_config {
airflow_config_overrides = {
SECTION - KEY = " OVERRIDE_VALUE "
}
env_variables = {
VAR_NAME = " VAR_VALUE "
}
}
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
SECTION with the section in the configuration file where the Airflow
configuration option is located.
KEY with the name of the Airflow configuration option.
OVERRIDE_VALUE with a value of the Airflow configuration option.
VAR_NAME with the name of the environment variable.
VAR_VALUE with the value of the environment variable.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
software_config {
airflow_config_overrides = {
core-dags_are_paused_at_creation = "True"
webserver-dag_orientation = "TB"
}
env_variables = {
SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM = "user@example.com"
SENDGRID_API_KEY = "example-key"
}
}
node_config {
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Step 10. (Optional) Specify maintenance windows
Default maintenance windows in Cloud Composer 3
are defined in the following way:
All times are in the local time zone of the region where your environment is
located, but with daylight saving time ignored.
On Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday maintenance windows are from
00:00:00 to 02:00:00.
On Saturday, Sunday, and Monday maintenance windows are from 00:00:00
to 04:00:00.
To specify custom maintenance windows for your environment:
Console
On the Create environment page
Locate the Maintenance windows section.
In the Timezone drop-down list, choose a time zone for maintenance
windows.
Set Start time , Days , and Length , so that:
At least 12 hours of time is allocated in a single week.
You can use several time slots, but each slot duration must be at least
4 hours.
For example, a period of 4 hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
provides the required amount of time.
gcloud
The following arguments define maintenance windows parameters:
--maintenance-window-start sets the start time of a maintenance
window.
--maintenance-window-end sets the end time of a maintenance window.
--maintenance-window-recurrence sets
the maintenance window recurrence .
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \

MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE with
an RFC 5545 RRULE for maintenance
windows recurrence. Cloud Composer supports two formats:
The FREQ=DAILY format specifies a daily recurrence.
The FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA format specifies a
recurrence on selected days of the week.
The following example specifies a 6-hour maintenance window between 01:00 and
07:00 (UTC) on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The 1 January, 2023
date is ignored.
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \

MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE with an RFC 5545 RRULE for maintenance windows
recurrence. Cloud Composer supports two formats:
The FREQ=DAILY format specifies a daily recurrence.
The FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA format specifies a
recurrence on selected days of the week.
The following example specifies a 6-hour maintenance window between 01:00 and
07:00 (UTC) on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The 1 January, 2023
date is ignored.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{

Terraform
The maintenance_window block specifies the maintenance windows for your
environment:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
maintenance_window {
start_time = " DATETIME_START "
end_time = " DATETIME_END "
recurrence = " MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE "
}
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "

end_time = "2023-01-01T07:00:00Z"
recurrence = "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,WE,SA"
}
}
}
Step 11. (Optional) Data lineage integration
Data lineage is a Knowledge Catalog feature that lets you track data movement.
Data lineage integration is available in all versions
of Cloud Composer 3.
Data lineage integration is automatically enabled in a new
Cloud Composer environment if the following conditions are met:
Data Lineage API is enabled in your project. For more information, see
Enabling Data Lineage API in
Knowledge Catalog documentation.
Caution: After you enable Data Lineage API, Knowledge Catalog
automatically starts ingesting data for BigQuery,
Cloud Data Fusion, Managed Service for Apache Spark. This happens even if you don't
create a Cloud Composer environment with data lineage
integration.
A custom Lineage Backend isn't configured in
Airflow.
You can disable data lineage integration when you create an environment. For
example, if you want to override the automatic behavior or choose to
enable data lineage later , after the environment is
created.
Console
To disable Data lineage integration, on the Create environment page:
In the Advanced configuration section, expand
the Show advanced configuration item.
In the Dataplex data lineage integration section, select
Disable integration with Dataplex data lineage .
gcloud
When you create an environment, the --disable-cloud-data-lineage-integration
argument disables the data lineage integration.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--disable-cloud-data-lineage-integration
Replace:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME with the name of the environment.
LOCATION with the region where the environment is located.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--disable-cloud-data-lineage-integration
Step 12. (Optional) Configure data encryption (CMEK)
By default, data in your environment is encrypted with a key provided by
Google.
To use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) to encrypt data in your
environment, follow the instructions outlined in
Using customer-managed encryption keys .
Step 13. (Optional) Use a custom environment's bucket
Warning: Because your environment runs DAGs on behalf of your environment's service account, users who can add and modify DAGs in the custom environment's bucket can run their code on behalf of the environment's service account and
exercise all permissions of this account . Make sure that you are familiar
with
security considerations for environment's service accounts
and understand how this account interacts with permissions and roles that you
grant to individual users in your project.
When you create an environment, Cloud Composer creates a bucket for
your environment automatically.
As an alternative, you can specify a custom Cloud Storage bucket from your
project. Your environment uses this bucket in the same way as the automatically
created bucket.
To use a custom environment bucket, follow the instructions outlined in
Use a custom environment's bucket .
Step 14. (Optional) Configure database retention
If you enable database retention in your environment, then
Cloud Composer periodically removes records related to DAG
executions and user sessions older than the specified time period from the
Airflow database. The most recent DAG run information is always retained.
By default, database retention is enabled . To configure the retention
period for a new environment or disable database retention, follow the
instructions outlined in
Configure database retention policy . You can also configure
database retention later.
Step 15. (Optional) Specify environment labels
You can assign labels to your environments to
break down billing costs based on these labels .
Console
On the Create environment page, in the Labels section:
Click Add label .
In Key and Value fields, specify key and value pairs for the
environment labels.
gcloud
When you create an environment, the --labels argument specifies a comma-separated list of keys and values with environment labels.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--labels LABELS
Replace:
LABELS with a list of comma-separated KEY=VALUE pairs for environment
labels.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--labels owner = engineering-team,env = production
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment
resource, specify labels for your environment.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"labels" : {
" LABEL_KEY " : " LABEL_VALUE "
}
}
Replace:
LABEL_KEY with a key of the environment label.
LABEL_VALUE with a value of the environment label.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"labels" : {
"owner" : "engineering-team" ,
"env" : "production"
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, specify labels in the labels block (
outside of the config block).
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
labels = {
LABEL_KEY = " LABEL_VALUE "
}
}
Replace:
LABEL_KEY with a key of the environment label.
LABEL_VALUE with a value of the environment label.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
labels = {
owner = "engineering-team"
env = "production"
}
}
