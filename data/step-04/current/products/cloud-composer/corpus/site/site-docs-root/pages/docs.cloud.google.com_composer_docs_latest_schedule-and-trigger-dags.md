This page explains how scheduling and DAG triggering works in Airflow, how to
define a schedule for a DAG, and how to trigger a DAG manually or pause it.
About Airflow DAGs in Cloud Composer
Airflow DAGs in Cloud Composer are executed in
one or more Cloud Composer environments in your
project. You upload source files of your Airflow DAGs to
a Cloud Storage bucket associated with an environment. The environment's
instance of Airflow then parses these files and schedules DAG runs, as defined
by each DAG's schedule. During a DAG run, Airflow schedules and executes
individual tasks that make up a DAG in a sequence defined by the DAG.
To learn more about Airflow's core concepts such as Airflow DAGs, DAG runs,
tasks, or operators, see the Core Concepts page in the
Airflow documentation.
About DAG scheduling in Airflow
Airflow provides the following concepts for its scheduling mechanism:
Logical date
Represents a date for which a particular DAG run is executed .
This is not the actual date when Airflow runs a DAG, but a period of time
that a particular DAG run must process. For example, for a DAG that is
scheduled to run every day at 12:00, the logical date would also be 12:00
on a specific day. Since it runs twice per day, the period of time it must
process is the past 12 hours. At the same time, the logic defined in the
DAG itself might not use the logical date or the time interval at all.
For example, a DAG might run the same script once per day without using the
value of the logical date.
In Airflow versions earlier than 2.2, this date is called execution date .
Run date
Represents a date when a particular DAG run is executed .
For example, for a DAG that is scheduled to run every day at 12:00 the
actual execution of the DAG might happen on 12:05, some time after the
logical date passes.
Schedule interval
Represents when and how often a DAG must be executed, in terms of logical
dates.
For example, a daily schedule means that a DAG is executed once per day,
and the logical dates for its DAG runs have 24 hour intervals.
Start date
Specifies when you want Airflow to start scheduling your DAG.
Tasks in your DAG can have individual start dates, or you can specify a
single start date for all tasks. Based on the minimum start date for tasks
in your DAG and on the schedule interval, Airflow schedules DAG runs.
Catchup, backfill, and retries
Mechanisms for executing DAG runs for past dates.
Catchup executes DAG runs that didn't run yet, for example,
if the DAG was paused for a long period of time and then unpaused. You can
use backfill to execute DAG runs for a certain range of dates. Retries
specify how many attempts Airflow must make when executing tasks from a DAG.
Scheduling works in the following way:
After the start date passes, Airflow waits for the next occurrence of the
schedule interval.
Airflow schedules the first DAG run to happen at the end of this schedule
interval.
For example, if a DAG is scheduled to run every hour and the start date is
at 12:00 today, then the first DAG run happens at 13:00 today.
The Schedule an Airflow DAG section in this document describes
how to set up scheduling for your DAGs using these concepts. For more
information about DAG runs and scheduling, see
DAG Runs in the Airflow documentation.
About ways to trigger a DAG
Airflow provides the following ways to trigger a DAG:
Trigger on a schedule . Airflow triggers the DAG
automatically based on the schedule specified for it in the DAG file.
Trigger manually . You can trigger a DAG manually from
Google Cloud console, Airflow UI, or by running an Airflow CLI command
from Google Cloud CLI.
Trigger in response to events. The standard way to trigger a DAG in
response to events is to use a sensor .
Other ways to trigger DAGs:
Trigger programmatically. You can
trigger a DAG using the Airflow REST API .
For example, from a Python script.
Trigger programmatically in response to events. You can trigger DAGs in
response to events by using
Cloud Run functions and the Airflow REST API .
Before you begin
Make sure that your account has a role that can manage objects in the
environment buckets and view and trigger DAGs.
For more information, see Access control .
Schedule an Airflow DAG
You define a schedule for a DAG in the DAG file. Edit the DAG's definition in
the following way:
Locate and edit the DAG file on your computer. If you don't have the DAG
file, you can download its copy
from the environment's bucket . For a new DAG, you
can define all parameters when you create the DAG file.
In the schedule parameter, define the schedule. You can use a
Cron expression, such as 0 0 * * * , or a preset, such as @daily . For
more information, see Cron and Time Intervals
in the Airflow documentation.
Airflow determines logical dates for DAG runs based on the schedule that
you set.
In the start_date parameter, define the start date.
Airflow determines the logical date of the first DAG run using this
parameter.
(Optional) In the catchup parameter, define if Airflow must execute
all previous runs of this DAG from the start date to the current date that
weren't executed yet.
DAG runs executed during the catchup will have their logical date in the
past and their run date will reflect the time when the DAG run was actually
executed.
Note: To backfill DAG runs for a certain date instead of catching up, run
the dags backfill
Airflow CLI command using Google Cloud CLI .
(Optional) In the retries parameter, define how many times Airflow
must retry tasks that failed (each DAG consists of one or more individual
tasks). By default, tasks in Cloud Composer are retried two
times.
Upload the new version of the DAG to the environment's
bucket.
Wait until Airflow successfully parses the DAG. For example, you can check
the list of DAGs in your environment in the
Google Cloud console or in the Airflow UI .
The following example DAG definition runs twice a day at 00:00 and 12:00. Its
start date is set to January 1, 2024, but Airflow does not run it for past dates
after you upload or pause it because the catchup is disabled.
The DAG contains one task named insert_query_job , which inserts a row into a
table with the BigQueryInsertJobOperator operator. This operator is one of
Google Cloud BigQuery Operators ,
which you can use to manage datasets and tables, run queries, and validate data.
If a particular execution of this task fails, Airflow retries it four more
times with the default retry interval. The logical date for these retries
remains the same.
The SQL query for this row uses
Airflow templates to write DAG's logical date
and name to the row.
import datetime
from airflow.models.dag import DAG
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.bigquery import BigQueryInsertJobOperator
with DAG (
"bq_example_scheduling_dag" ,
start_date = datetime . datetime ( 2024 , 1 , 1 ),
schedule = '0 */12 * * *' ,
catchup = False
) as dag :
insert_query_job = BigQueryInsertJobOperator (
task_id = "insert_query_job" ,
retries = 4 ,
configuration = {
"query" : {
# schema: date (string), description (string)
# example row: "20240101T120000", "DAG run: <DAG: bq_example_scheduling_dag>"
"query" : "INSERT example_dataset.example_table VALUES ('{{ ts_nodash }}', 'DAG run: {{ dag }}' )" ,
"useLegacySql" : False ,
"priority" : "BATCH" ,
}
},
location = "us-central1"
)
insert_query_job
To test this DAG, you can trigger it manually and
then view the task execution logs .
More scheduling parameter examples
The following scheduling parameter examples illustrate how scheduling works with
different combinations of parameters:
If start_date is datetime(2024, 4, 4, 16, 25) and schedule is
30 16 * * * , then the first DAG run happens at 16:30 on 5 April, 2024.
If start_date is datetime(2024, 4, 4, 16, 35) and schedule is
30 16 * * * , then the first DAG run happens at 16:30 on 6 April, 2024.
Because the start date is after the schedule interval on 4 April, 2024,
the DAG run does not happen on 5 April, 2024. Instead, the schedule
interval ends at 16:35 on 5 April, 2024, so the next DAG run is scheduled
for 16:30 on the following day.
If start_date is datetime(2024, 4, 4) , and the schedule is
@daily , then the first DAG run is scheduled for 00:00 on April 5, 2024.
If start_date is datetime(2024, 4, 4, 16, 30) , and
the schedule is 0 * * * * , then the first DAG run is
scheduled for 18:00 on April 4, 2024. After the specified date and time
passes, Airflow schedules a DAG run to happen at the minute 0 of every
hour. The nearest point in time when this happens is 17:00. At this time,
Airflow schedules a DAG run to happen at the end of the schedule interval,
that is, at 18:00.
Trigger a DAG manually
When you manually trigger an Airflow DAG, Airflow runs
the DAG once, independently from the schedule specified in the DAG file.
Console
To trigger a DAG from Google Cloud console:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
Select an environment to view its details.
On the Environment details page, go to the DAGs tab.
Click the name of a DAG.
On the DAG details page, click Trigger DAG . A new DAG run is
created.
Note: You cannot specify a configuration for the DAG run from
Google Cloud console.
Airflow UI
To trigger a DAG from the Airflow UI:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
In the Airflow webserver column, follow the Airflow link for your
environment.
Sign in with the Google Account that has the appropriate permissions.
In the Airflow UI, on the DAGs page, click the Trigger DAG button
for your DAG.
gcloud
Important: If you want to trigger a large number of DAGs , we recommend to
do it with Airflow REST API . Triggering DAGs
through Google Cloud CLI might cause your environment to reach
quota limits for Airflow CLI commands, and as a result, they
will no longer be executed.
Run the dags trigger Airflow CLI command:
gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
dags trigger -- DAG_ID
Replace the following:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME : the name of your environment.
LOCATION : the region where the environment is located.
DAG_ID : the name of the DAG.
For more information about running Airflow CLI commands in
Cloud Composer environments, see
Running Airflow CLI commands .
For more information about the available Airflow CLI commands, see
the gcloud composer environments run command reference .
View DAG run logs and details
In the Google Cloud console, you can:
View statuses of past DAG runs and DAG details .
Explore detailed logs of all DAG runs and all tasks
from these DAG.
View DAG statistics .
In addition, Cloud Composer provides access to the
Airflow UI , which is Airflow's own web interface.
Note: The Orchestration page in BigQuery
combines scheduling information for all Airflow DAGs from all
Cloud Composer 3 environments in your project, as well as other types of
assets available in BigQuery.
Pause a DAG
Caution: If you defined catchup for the DAG that runs on a
schedule, then Airflow schedules all non-executed DAG runs when you unpause
the DAG.
Console
To pause a DAG from Google Cloud console:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
Select an environment to view its details.
On the Environment details page, go to the DAGs tab.
Click the name of a DAG.
On the DAG details page, click Pause DAG .
Airflow UI
To pause a DAG from the Airflow UI:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
In the Airflow webserver column, follow the Airflow link for your
environment.
Sign in with the Google Account that has the appropriate permissions.
In the Airflow web interface, on the DAGs page, click
the toggle next to the DAG's name.
gcloud
Run the dags pause Airflow CLI command:
gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
dags pause -- DAG_ID
Replace the following:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME : the name of your environment.
LOCATION : the region where the environment is located.
DAG_ID : the name of the DAG.
