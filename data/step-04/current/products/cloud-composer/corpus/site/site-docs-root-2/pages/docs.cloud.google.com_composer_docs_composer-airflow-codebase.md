On September 15, 2026 , all Cloud Composer 1 versions and versions 2.0.x of Cloud Composer 2 will reach their planned end of life . You will not be able to use environments with these versions. We recommend planning migration to Cloud Composer 3 . Cloud Composer 2 versions 2.1.x and later are still supported and are not impacted by this change.

Cloud Composer's Airflow code repository
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes the repository that stores patched Apache Airflow code used
in Cloud Composer.
About the repository
The Composer-Airflow repository is a
read-only repository that contains the patched Apache Airflow code running in
Cloud Composer.
Warning: Cloud Composer doesn't support on-premise or production
usage of this code. We strongly recommend to
avoid using the code from this repository in production . Instead, see
Usage examples for some ways in which you can use this repository.
A particular version of Apache Airflow found in Cloud Composer is
not always an exact match of the corresponding version in upstream Airflow
because Cloud Composer uses a patched version of Airflow. This
repository holds the code for every patched version of Airflow used in
Cloud Composer. For information about which versions of Airflow are
found in Cloud Composer, see
Cloud Composer versions list .
Contributing
This code is not a fork of Apache Airflow . The code
found in this repository comes directly from the Apache Airflow repository, but
at a different timeline than normal Apache Airflow releases.
If you would like to contribute to this codebase,
then contribute to Airflow directly
instead. Don't do so in this repository because Pull Requests aren't accepted
in it.
Issues and support
If you have an issue with the code found in this repository, you can create
an issue directly
in the Airflow repository .
If you have an issue with Cloud Composer, please use
Cloud Composer support channels .
Navigating the repository
The repository has one branch for each version of Airflow available in
Cloud Composer. Not all versions of Airflow are supported in
Cloud Composer. You can see which Airflow versions are supported by a particular Cloud Composer version in the
Cloud Composer versions list .
Usage examples
This section lists usage examples for the repository.
Is this commit from the Airflow repository in my version of Cloud Composer?
SHA1s of commits in the
Composer-Airflow repository
don't correspond to commit SHA1s in the
upstream Airflow repository . One of the ways to
search for a specific commit is by looking for the corresponding commit message.
It is not possible to use the GitHub UI to search through commit messages in
branches other than the default branch, however, it is possible to do so using
the git CLI. To search for a particular commit in this repository, you need
to have git installed .
To search for a commit message using the git CLI:
Clone the repository and change to the repository directory using the
following command:
git clone git@github.com:GoogleCloudPlatform/composer-airflow.git && \
cd composer-airflow
Search for the commit message:
git log --source --grep = " COMMIT_MESSAGE " --all
In this command:
--source shows the branch where the commit is found
--grep specifies the message that must be searched the log
--all searches in all branches
The branch is located next to the commit hash in the first line of every
result. If the command returns a commit, this means it's in your version
of Cloud Composer. Additionally, if the version of Airflow in
your environment is later than the branch version, then the commit is used
in your environment's Airflow version.
For example, if you want to search for the commit message
Force explicit choice on GPL dependency , then your command would be:
git log --source --grep = "Force explicit choice on GPL dependency" --all
If there is a matching commit , then
your results would look like the following output example. There might be more
than one result.

[AIRFLOW-2817] Force explicit choice on GPL dependency (#3660)
By default one of Apache Airflow's dependencies pulls in a GPL
library. Airflow should not install (and upgrade) without an explicit choice.
This is part of the Apache requirements as we cannot depend on Category X
software.

What does this Airflow operator look like in my version of Cloud Composer?
Airflow operators and accompanying code are packaged and released separately
from core Airflow in PyPI packages called
provider packages .
Some of these packages are installed by default in Cloud Composer.
To know which version is installed in your environment, check the list of
packages for your environment's version of Cloud Composer in the
versions list .
GitHub UI
To look at the code for an operator in a particular provider package version:
Go to the upstream Airflow repo .
Enter the name of the operator you are searching for in the GitHub search
bar.
If more than one file is returned, click the code file with a path
that begins in airflow/providers .
For example, if you search for the
GoogleCloudStorageCreateBucketOperator , then choose
airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/gcs.py .
Click the branch selector, which opens up the Switch branches/tags
drop-down list.
Click the Tags tab.
For providers packages, search for the name of your provider and the
version by typing
providers- PROVIDER_NAME / PROVIDER_VERSION
in the drop-down list's search bar, where PROVIDER_NAME is the name of
the provider, and PROVIDER_VERSION is the name of the version you are
looking for.
For example, if you want to see version 10.0.0 of the
apache-airflow-providers-google package, you would search for
providers-google/10.0.0 .
For backport-providers packages, which are used in Airflow 1, search for
backport-providers- PROVIDER_VERSION in the drop-down list's
search bar.
For example, if you want to see version 2021.3.3 of the
apache-airflow-backport-providers-google package, then search for
backport-providers-2021.3.3 .
Click the result that matches your query.
The code on the screen is what is running in your version of that
operator. You can also click History to see the commit history up
until this point.
git CLI
To look at the code for an operator in a particular provider package version:
Clone the upstream Airflow repo .
For providers packages, run
git checkout providers- PROVIDER_NAME / PROVIDER_VERSION ,
where PROVIDER_NAME is the name of the provider, and PROVIDER_VERSION
is the name of the version you are looking for.
For example, if you want to see version 10.0.0 of the
apache-airflow-providers-google package, then run
git checkout providers-google/10.0.0 .
For backport-providers packages, which are used in Airflow 1, run
git checkout backport-providers- PROVIDER_VERSION .
For example, if you want to see version 2021.3.3 of the
apache-airflow-backport-providers-google package,then run
git checkout backport-providers-2021.3.3 .
If you don't know the filepath for the operator, you can search for it
with the git grep command. The following example demonstrates how to
search for GoogleCloudStorageCreateBucketOperator.
git grep GoogleCloudStorageCreateBucketOperator
The output is a list of files where the string (in this case, the
operator's name) can be found. From that list, navigate to the
file and examine its contents further.

GoogleCloudStorageCreateBucketOperator(BaseOperator):

Note: Running these commands switches your local repository to this tag and
leaves it in a 'detached HEAD' state . This is
expected. Follow the instructions in your terminal to switch back to a branch.
