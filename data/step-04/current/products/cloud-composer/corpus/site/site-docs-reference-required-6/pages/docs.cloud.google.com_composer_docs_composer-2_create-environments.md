Cloud Composer 3 | Cloud Composer 2 | Cloud Composer 1
This page explains how to create a Cloud Composer environment.
For more information about environments, see Environment architecture .
For more information about creating an environment with Terraform, see Create environments (Terraform) .
Before you begin
Enable the Cloud Composer API . For the full list
of services used by Cloud Composer, see
Services required by Cloud Composer .
The approximate time to create an environment is
25 minutes.
If you create an environment with Terraform, the service account used by
Terraform must have a role with
the composer.environments.create permission enabled.
For more information about the service account for Terraform, see
Google Provider Configuration Reference .
For more information about using Terraform to create a
Cloud Composer environment, see
Terraform documentation .
For more information about additional parameters, see
Terraform Argument Reference .
Private IP : There are specific network and peering requirements to
create a Private IP environment. For more information, see
Configuring private IP .
Shared VPC : There are specific network requirements to use Shared VPC
with Cloud Composer. For information, see
Configuring shared VPC .
VPC SC : To deploy Cloud Composer environments inside a security
perimeter, see Configuring VPC SC . When used with
Cloud Composer, VPC Service Controls have several
known limitations .
You might notice
Compute Engine metadata
entries for the GKE clusters that belong to environments
in your project. During GKE cluster creation and upgrades,
Google Kubernetes Engine automatically adds project-level metadata entries
( google_compute_project_metadata ) to track secondary IP address range
usage. Don't modify or remove these entries. Google Kubernetes Engine manages them
automatically.
Important: For production use cases, we highly recommend to use
highly resilient environments . The Airflow database
of your environment is zonal. During a zonal outage, Airflow tasks that are
executed in the affected zone are interrupted and marked as failed by Airflow.
Highly resilient environments are more resilient to this issue, because their
databases are located in two separate zones.
Step 1. Create or choose an environment's service account
When you create an environment, you specify a service account. This service
account is called environment's service account . Your environment uses this
service account to perform most of the operations.
The service account for your environment is not a user account. A
service account is a special kind of account used by an application or a
virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person.
You can't change the service account of your environment later.
Warning: Your environment's service account can have
too broad permissions on your project . Because your environment runs DAGs on
behalf of your environment's service account, users who can add and modify DAGs
in your environment's bucket
or modify Artifact Registry repositories in your
project
can run their code on behalf of the environment's service account and
exercise all permissions of this account . Make sure that you are familiar
with
security considerations for environment's service accounts
and understand how this account interacts with permissions and roles that you
grant to individual users in your project.
If you don't have a service account for Cloud Composer
environments in your project yet, create it.
See Create environments (Terraform) for an
extended example of creating a service account for your environment in
Terraform.
Important: You can use the same service account for more than one
Cloud Composer environment. In this case, if you grant extra
permissions to access resources in your project to this account, all
environments that use it will get the same permissions.
To create a new service account for your environment:
Create a new service account as described in
the Identity and Access Management documentation.
Grant a role to it , as described in the Identity and Access Management
documentation. The required role is Composer Worker ( composer.worker ).
If your environment
uses resource location restrictions ,
or installs PyPI packages
from an Artifact Registry repository or
from a private repository , then grant
the Service Account User ( iam.serviceAccountUser ) role to the
user-managed service account that runs your environment on itself
(both the principal and the resource are the same service account).
To access other resources in your Google Cloud project, grant
extra permissions to access those resources to this service account.
The Composer Worker ( composer.worker ) role provides this required
set of permissions in most cases. Add extra permissions to this service
account only when it's necessary for the operation of your DAGs.
Step 2. Basic setup
This step creates a Cloud Composer environment with default
parameters in the specified location.
Note: All other steps in this guide explain how to customize and configure
different aspects of your environment. All of the remaining steps are optional.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create environment page.
Go to Create environment
In the Name field, enter a name for your environment.
The name must start with a lowercase letter followed by up to 62 lowercase
letters, numbers, or hyphens, and can't end with a hyphen. The environment
name is used to create subcomponents for the environment, so you must provide
a name that is also valid as a Cloud Storage
bucket name. See Bucket naming guidelines for a list
of restrictions.
In the Location drop-down list, choose a location
for your environment.
A location is the region where the environment is located.
In the Image version drop-down list, select
a Cloud Composer image with the required
version of Airflow.
In
the Service account drop-down list,
select a service account for your environment.
If you don't have a service
account for your environment yet, see
Create or choose an environment's service account .

}
node_config {
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Step 3. Grant required permissions to Cloud Composer service account
When you enable Cloud Composer API in your project, the
Composer Service Agent account is created in your project.
Cloud Composer uses this account to perform operations in your
Google Cloud project.
Cloud Composer v2 API Service Agent Extension role provides additional
permissions to Cloud Composer Service Agent account. This role is
not granted automatically . You must grant it manually.
Warning: After you grant these permissions, the Composer Service Agent account
can modify the IAM policy of your environment's service
account . For more information about the additional permissions, see
Grant roles to Cloud Composer Service Agent account .
Console
When you create an environment in your project, if
Cloud Composer Service Agent does not have required permissions on the environment's service account, then
a Grant required permissions to Cloud Composer service account section
appears.
You add Cloud Composer Service Agent account as a new principal
on your environment's service account and grant the Cloud Composer v2 API
Service Agent Extension role to it.
Confirm that you use the intended service account for your environment, and
click Grant .
gcloud
You add Cloud Composer Service Agent account as a new principal
on your environment's service account and grant the Cloud Composer v2 API
Service Agent Extension role to it.
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
--member serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @cloudcomposer-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role roles/composer.ServiceAgentV2Ext
Replace:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT with the service account for your environment.
PROJECT_NUMBER with
the Project number .
Example:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
example-account@example-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--member serviceAccount:service-00000000000@cloudcomposer-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role roles/composer.ServiceAgentV2Ext
API
To grant the role, you must modify the existing allow policy
using the read-modify-write pattern:
Read the existing allow policy for the service account of your environment.
Modify it to include the roles/composer.ServiceAgentV2Ext role for the Cloud Composer Service Agent.
Rewrite the existing allow policy.
For more information, see Controlling access programmatically .
{
"role" : "roles/composer.ServiceAgentV2Ext" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @cloudcomposer-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
]
}
Replace:
PROJECT_NUMBER with
the Project number .
Example:
{
"role" : "roles/composer.ServiceAgentV2Ext" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service-00000000000@cloudcomposer-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
]
}
Terraform
Add a new role binding to your environment's service account allow policy .
You add Cloud Composer Service Agent account as a new principal
on your environment's service account and grant the Cloud Composer v2 API
Service Agent Extension role to it.
If you are not using Terraform to define your environment's service account allow policy, do
not use the following example. Instead, add this binding using other methods.
resource "google_service_account_iam_member" "custom_service_account" {
provider = google-beta
service_account_id = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
role = "roles/composer.ServiceAgentV2Ext"
member = "serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @cloudcomposer-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
Replace:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT with the service account for your environment.
PROJECT_NUMBER with
the Project number .
Example:
resource "google_service_account_iam_member" "custom_service_account" {
provider = google-beta
service_account_id = "example-account@example-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
role = "roles/composer.ServiceAgentV2Ext"
member = "serviceAccount:service-00000000000@cloudcomposer-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
Step 4. (Optional) Configure environment scale and performance parameters
To specify the scale and performance configuration for your environment,
select the environment size and workloads configuration.
You can change all performance and scale parameters
after you create an environment.
Following parameters control the scale and performance:
Environment size . Controls the performance parameters of the managed
Cloud Composer infrastructure that includes the Airflow
database. Consider selecting a larger environment size if you want to run a
large number of DAGs and tasks with higher infrastructure performance. For
example, larger environment's size increases the amount of Airflow task log
entries that your environment can process with minimal delay.
Workloads configuration . Controls the scale and performance of Airflow
components that run in a GKE cluster of your environment.
Airflow scheduler . Parses DAG definition files, schedules DAG runs
based on the schedule interval, and queues tasks for execution by
Airflow workers.
Your environment can run more than one Airflow scheduler at the same
time. Use multiple schedulers to distribute load between several
scheduler instances for better performance and reliability.
Increasing the number of schedulers does not always improve Airflow
performance. For example, having only one scheduler might provide better
performance than having two. This might happen when the extra scheduler is not
utilized, and thus consumes resources of your environment without contributing
to overall performance. The actual scheduler performance depends on the
number of Airflow workers, the number of DAGs and tasks that run in your
environment, and the configuration of both Airflow and the environment.
We recommend starting with two schedulers and then monitoring the performance
of your environment. If you change the number of schedulers, you can always
scale your environment back to the original number of schedulers.
For more information about configuring multiple schedulers, see
Airflow documentation .
Airflow triggerer . Asynchronously monitors all deferred tasks in your
environment. If you have at least one triggerer instance in your
environment (or at least two in highly resilient environments), you can
use deferrable operators in your DAGs .
In Cloud Composer 2, the Airflow triggerer is disabled by default. If
you want to create an environment with a triggerer, set the number of
triggerers to one or more.
Airflow web server . Runs the Airflow web interface where you can
monitor, manage, and visualize your DAGs.
Airflow workers . Execute tasks that are scheduled by Airflow
schedulers. The minimum and maximum number of workers in your
environment changes dynamically depending on the number of tasks in the
queue.
Note: When configuring resource limits for Airflow components, make sure that
the limits exceed the minimum resource requirements for your usage scenario.
Sidecar containers that run alongside the main
Airflow component's container utilize some of the allocated resources.
Console
You can select a preset for your environment. When you select a preset, the
scale and performance parameters for that preset are automatically selected.
You also have an option to select a custom preset and specify all scale and
performance parameters for your environment.
To select the scale and performance configuration for your environment, on
the Create environment page:
To use predefined values, in the Environment resources section, click
Small , Medium , Large .
To specify custom values for the scale and performance parameters:
In the Environment resources section, click Custom .
In the Scheduler section, set the number of schedulers you want to
use, and the resource allocation for their CPU, memory, and storage.
In the Triggerer section, use the Number of triggerers field
to enter the number of triggerers in your environment.
If you don't want to
use deferrable operators in your DAGs ,
set the number of triggerers to zero.
By default, the triggerer is disabled in Cloud Composer 2.
If you set at least one triggerer for your environment, use the
the CPU , and Memory fields to configure resource allocation
for your triggerers.
In the DAG processor section, specify the number of DAG processors
in your environment and the amount of CPUs, memory, and storage for
each DAG processor.
Highly resilient environments require at least two DAG processors.
In the Web server section, specify the amount of CPUs, memory, and
storage for the web server.
In the Worker section, specify:
The minimum and maximum number of workers for autoscaling limits in
your environment.
The CPU, memory, and storage allocation for your workers
In the Core infrastructure section, in the Environment size
drop-down list, select the environment size.
gcloud
When you create an environment, the following arguments control the
scale and performance parameters of your environment.
Note: If you omit an argument, Cloud Composer uses the default
value.
--environment-size specifies the environment size.
--scheduler-count specifies the number of schedulers.
--scheduler-cpu specifies the number of CPUs for an Airflow scheduler.
--scheduler-memory specifies the amount of memory for an Airflow
scheduler.
--scheduler-storage specifies the amount of disk space for an Airflow
scheduler.
--triggerer-count specifies the number of Airflow triggerers in your
environment. The default value for this flag is 0 .
You need triggerers if you want to
use deferrable operators in your DAGs .
For standard resilience environments, use a value between 0 and
10 .
For highly resilient environments, use 0 or a value between
2 and 10 .
--triggerer-cpu specifies the number of CPUs for an Airflow
triggerer, in vCPU units. Allowed values: 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 . The default
value is 0.5 .
--triggerer-memory specifies the amount of memory for an
Airflow triggerer, in GB. The default value is 0.5 .
The minimum required memory is equal to the number of CPUs allocated for
the triggerers. The maximum allowed value is equal to the number of
triggerer CPUs multiplied by 6.5.
For example, if you set the --triggerer-cpu flag to 1 , the
minimum value for --triggerer-memory is 1 and the
maximum value is 6.5 .
--web-server-cpu specifies the number of CPUs for the Airflow web server.
--web-server-memory specifies the amount of memory for the Airflow web
server.
--web-server-storage specifies the amount of disk space for the Airflow
web server.
--worker-cpu specifies the number of CPUs for an Airflow worker.
--worker-memory specifies the amount of memory for an Airflow worker.
--worker-storage specifies the amount of disk space for an Airflow
worker.
--min-workers specifies the minimum number of Airflow workers. Your
environment's cluster runs at least this number of workers.
--max-workers specifies the maximum number of Airflow workers. Your
environment's cluster runs at most this number of workers.

Step 5. (Optional) Enable high resilience mode
Highly resilient (Highly Available)
Cloud Composer environments are environments that use built-in
redundancy and failover mechanisms that reduce the environment's susceptibility
to zonal failures and single point of failure outages.
Important: We strongly recommend to
use highly resilient environments for production use cases .
A highly resilient environment is multi-zonal and runs across at
least two zones of a selected region. The following components run in separate
zones:
Exactly two Airflow schedulers
At least two triggerers
( if the number of triggerers isn't set to 0 )
Two web servers
The minimum number of workers is set to two, and your environment's cluster
distributes worker instances between zones. In case of a zonal outage, affected
worker instances are rescheduled in a different zone. The Cloud SQL
component of a highly resilient environment has a primary instance and a standby
instance that are distributed between zones.
Important: In Cloud Composer 2, highly resilient environments are
available only for Private IP environments.
Console
On the Create environment page:
In the Resilience mode section, select High resilience .
In the Environment resources section, select scale parameters for a
highly resilient environment. Highly resilient environments require
exactly two schedulers, zero or between two and ten triggerers, and at least two workers:
Click Custom .
In the Number of schedulers drop-down list, select 2 .
In the Number of triggerers drop-down list, select 0 ,
or a value between 2 and 10 . Configure the CPU and Memory
allocation for your triggerers.
In the Minimum number of workers drop-down list, select 2 or
more, depending on the required number of workers.
In the Network configuration section:
In the Networking type , select Private IP environment .
If required, specify other networking parameters .
gcloud
When you create an environment, the --enable-high-resilience argument
enables the high resilience mode.
Set the following arguments:
--enable-high-resilience
--enable-private-environment , and
other networking parameters for a Private IP environment,
if required
--scheduler-count to 2
--triggerer-count to 0 or a value between 2 and 10 .
If you use triggerers, the --triggerer-cpu and --triggerer-memory`
flags are also required for environment creation.
For more information about --triggerer-count , --triggerer-cpu , and
--triggerer-memory flags, see
Configure environment scale and performance parameters .
--min-workers to 2 or more
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--enable-high-resilience \
--enable-private-environment \
--scheduler-count 2 \
--triggerer-count 2 \
--triggerer-cpu 0 .5 \
--triggerer-memory 0 .5 \
--min-workers 2
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, enable the high
resilience mode.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"resilience_mode" : "HIGH_RESILIENCE" ,
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"resilience_mode" : "HIGH_RESILIENCE" ,
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
Note: An update to the resilience mode field causes a failure instead of
leading to recreating the Cloud Composer environment.
When you create an environment, the resilience_mode field in the config
block enables the high resilience mode.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
resilience_mode = "HIGH_RESILIENCE"
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
resilience_mode = "HIGH_RESILIENCE"
node_config {
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Step 6. (Optional) Specify a zone for the environment's database
You can specify a preferred Cloud SQL zone when creating a standard
resilience environment.
Note: If your environment uses high resilience mode ,
you can't specify a zone for the database. Instead, Cloud Composer
automatically selects two zones in the region where the environment is located.
If you enable high resilience for an existing environment with the preferred
Cloud SQL zone, the preferred zone configuration is removed and two
zones are selected automatically.
Console
On the Create environment page:
In the Advanced configuration section, expand
the Show advanced configuration item.
In the Airflow database zone list, select a preferred
Cloud SQL zone.
gcloud
When you create an environment, the --cloud-sql-preferred-zone argument
specifies a preferred Cloud SQL zone.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--cloud-sql-preferred-zone SQL_ZONE
Replace the following:
SQL_ZONE : preferred Cloud SQL zone. This zone must be located
in the region where the environment is located.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--cloud-sql-preferred-zone us-central1-a
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment
> DatabaseConfig resource, specify the
preferred Cloud SQL zone.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"databaseConfig" : {
"zone" : " SQL_ZONE "
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace the following:
SQL_ZONE : preferred Cloud SQL zone. This zone must be located
in the region where the environment is located.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"databaseConfig" : {
"zone" : "us-central1-a"
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, the zone field in the database_config
block specifies the preferred Cloud SQL zone.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
database_config {
zone = " SQL_ZONE "
}
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace the following:
SQL_ZONE : preferred Cloud SQL zone. This zone must be located
in the region where the environment is located.
Step 7. (Optional) Configure your environment's networking
Networking parameters depend on the type of environment that you want to
create:
Public IP environment . Use the default networking parameters.
Private IP environment (with PSC) . In this configuration, your
environment uses Private Service Connect for connectivity.
Configure your Private IP environment:
Configure your project's networking for Private IP environments .
Configure Private Service Connect
when you create your environment.
Specify other parameters for your Private IP environment,
as described further in this section.
For a Private IP environment with PSC, you need to know:
Your VPC network ID
Your VPC subnetwork ID
Two secondary IP ranges in your VPC subnetwork:
Secondary IP range for pods
Secondary IP range for services
IP ranges for the components of the environment:
GKE Control Plane IP range. IP range for
the GKE control plane.
Cloud Composer connection subnetwork. IP range for the
Cloud Composer connection subnetwork.
Private IP environment (VPC peerings) . In this configuration, your
environment uses VPC peerings for connectivity.
Configure your Private IP environment:
Configure your project's networking for Private IP environments .
Specify other parameters for your Private IP environment, as described
further in this section.
For a Private IP environment with VPC peerings, you need to know:
Your VPC network ID
Your VPC subnetwork ID
Two secondary IP ranges in your VPC subnetwork:
Secondary IP range for pods
Secondary IP range for services
IP ranges for the components of the environment:
IP range for the GKE control plane.
IP range for VPC peering to export from the internal
Cloud Composer network to the selected network. Cloud Composer infrastructure components use IP addresses
from this range.
IP range for the Cloud SQL instance.
For a Shared VPC environment , you must do additional networking setup for
the host project, then create a Public or a Private IP environment in a
service project. Follow the instructions on the
Configuring Shared VPC page.
Important: If you create an environment in the service project using
Google Cloud console, then your account must have
the compute.subnetworks.use permission in the host project.
Otherwise, the list of available subnetworks does not contain subnetworks
from the host project. If you create an environment using gcloud , API,
or Terraform, then your account does not need this additional permission.
For a Shared VPC environment, you need to know:
Your host project VPC network ID
Your host project VPC subnetwork ID
Two secondary IP ranges in your host project VPC subnetwork:
Secondary IP range for pods
Secondary IP range for services
When creating a Public IP Shared VPC environment , you still need to
specify your host project VPC network, subnetwork, and secondary IP ranges
for pods and services.
To create a VPC SC environment , you must create a service perimeter and
then create Private IP environments inside this perimeter. Follow the
instructions outlined in Configuring VPC Service Controls .
Additional networking options for environments are:
Privately used public IP addresses . If you want to use more IP
addresses, your environment can
privately use certain public IP address ranges as internal,
subnet IP address ranges for pods and services.
Authorized networks . If you want to access the control plane of your
Private IP environment using HTTPS, you can use
authorized networks to specify CIDR ranges that can do so.
IP Masquerade agent . By using environments with the IP Masquerade
agent, you can use many-to-one IP address translations in your
environment's networking configurations. For more information about
creating environments with IP Masquerade agent, see
Enable the IP Masquerade agent .
Console
To create a Private IP environment:
Make sure that your networking is configured for the type of environment
that you want to create.
In the Network configuration section, expand
the Show network configuration item.
In the Network drop-down list, select your VPC network ID.
In the Subnetwork drop-down list, select your VPC subnetwork ID.
In the Secondary IP range for pods section, select or specify
the secondary IP range for pods. You can use an existing secondary range
in your VPC network, or choose to use an auto-created range.
In the Secondary IP range for services section, select or specify
the secondary IP range for services. You can use an existing secondary
range in your VPC network, or choose to use an auto-created range.
In the Networking type section, select the Private IP environment
option to create a Private IP environment.
In the Composer connectivity section, select the networking type for
your environment and specify IP ranges for environment components:
For an environment that uses Private Service Connect:
Select Private Service Connect for an environment that uses
Private Service Connect .
In the Composer connection subnetwork section specify an IP
range for the Cloud Composer connection subnetwork. The
address for the PSC endpoint is selected from this range. You can
specify a custom range, or choose to use the default one.
For an environment that uses VPC peerings:
Select VPC peerings for an environment that uses VPC peerings.
Note: Environments with VPC peerings
have more limitations than
environments with PSC.
In the IP range for Composer tenant network section specify an IP
range for the Cloud Composer tenant network. This network
hosts the SQL proxy component of your environment. You can
specify a custom range, or choose to use the default one.
In the IP range for Cloud SQL network section,
specify an IP range for the Cloud SQL instance. You can
specify a custom range, or choose to use the default one.
Caution: The 172.17.0.0/16 range
is reserved in Cloud SQL .
In the IP range for GKE control plane network
section, specify an IP range for the GKE control plane:
To use the default IP range for the region
where your environment is located, select Default IP range .
To specify a custom IP range, select Custom IP range and enter a
range in the CIDR notation in the GKE cluster master private IP
field.
Select the level access for the GKE control plane. The
control plane has two endpoints. One endpoint is private, for use by
cluster nodes and VMs. Another endpoint is public. You can specify the
level of access for the public endpoint:
To enable access to the public endpoint from authorized networks,
select the Access cluster control plane endpoint using its
external IP address checkbox.
Using this option sets the level of access for the control plane
to "Public endpoint access enabled, authorized networks enabled" .
This provides restricted access to the control plane from authorized
networks. By default, no source IP addresses are specified. You can
add authorized networks to the cluster .
To disable access to the public endpoint from authorized networks,
clear the Access cluster control plane endpoint using its
external IP address checkbox.
Using this option sets the level of access for the control plane to
"Public endpoint access disabled" .
This prevents all internet access to the control plane.
gcloud
Make sure that your networking is configured for the type of environment that you want to create.
When you create an environment, the following arguments control
the networking parameters. If you omit a parameter, the default value is
used.
--enable-private-environment enables a Private IP environment.
--network specifies your VPC network ID.
--subnetwork specifies your VPC subnetwork ID.
--cluster-secondary-range-name or --cluster-ipv4-cidr configures the
the secondary range for pods.
--services-secondary-range-name or --services-ipv4-cidr to configure
the secondary range for services.
--master-ipv4-cidr specifies a range for the GKE
control plane.
(Environments with PSC) --connection-subnetwork specifies a range for
the Cloud Composer connection subnetwork, which hosts the PSC
endpoint.
(Environments with VPC peerings) --connection-type=VPC_PEERING
specifies that an environment must use VPC peerings.
(Environments with VPC peerings) --composer-network-ipv4-cidr
specifies a range for the Cloud Composer tenant network. This network hosts the SQL proxy component of your environment.
(Environments with VPC peerings) --cloud-sql-ipv4-cidr specifies a
range for the Cloud SQL instance.
--enable-private-endpoint controls the level access for
the GKE control plane. The control plane has two
endpoints. One endpoint is private, for use by cluster nodes and VMs.
Another endpoint is public. You can specify the level of access for the
public endpoint:
To enable access to the public endpoint from authorized networks, omit the --enable-private-endpoint argument.
Using this option sets the level of access for the control plane to "Public endpoint access enabled, authorized networks enabled" . This provides restricted access to the control plane from authorized networks. By default, no source IP addresses are specified. You can add authorized networks to the cluster .
To disable access to the public endpoint from authorized networks, specify the --enable-private-endpoint argument.
Using this option sets the level of access for the control plane to "Public endpoint access disabled" . This prevents all internet access to the control plane.
--enable-master-authorized-networks and --master-authorized-networks
arguments configure authorized networks
for your environment.
--enable-privately-used-public-ips configures
privately used public IP addresses for your environment.
--enable-ip-masq-agent
enables the IP Masquerade agent .
Example (Private IP environment
)
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--enable-private-environment \
--network NETWORK_ID \
--subnetwork SUBNETWORK_ID \
--cluster-ipv4-cidr PODS_RANGE \
--services-ipv4-cidr SERVICES_RANGE \
--master-ipv4-cidr CONTROL_PLANE_RANGE \
--connection-subnetwork COMPOSER_PSC_RANGE \
Replace:
NETWORK_ID with your VPC network ID.
SUBNETWORK_ID with your VPC subnetwork ID.
PODS_RANGE with the secondary range for pods.
SERVICES_RANGE with the secondary range for services.
CONTROL_PLANE_RANGE with the secondary range for the GKE
control plane.
COMPOSER_PSC_RANGE with the range for the Cloud Composer
connection subnetwork.
Step 8. (Optional) Add network tags
Network tags are applied to all node VMs in your environment's
cluster. Tags are used to identify valid sources or targets for network
firewalls. Each tag within the list must comply with
RFC 1035 .
For example, you might want to add network tags if you plan to restrict
traffic for a Private IP environment with firewall rules.
Caution: You can't change network tags later. If you want to later configure
firewall rules that target only VMs in your environment's cluster, specify
network tags when you create your environment.
Console
On the Create environment page:
Locate the Network configuration section.
In the Network tags field, enter network tags for your environment.
gcloud
When you create an environment, following arguments control network tags:
--tags specifies a comma-separated list of network tags applied to all
node VMs.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--tags TAGS
Replace:
TAGS with a comma-separated list of network tags.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--tags group1,production
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, specify
network tags for your environment.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"nodeConfig" : {
"tags" : [
" TAG "
],
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
TAG with a network tag.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"nodeConfig" : {
"tags" : [
"group1" ,
"production"
],
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, following fields define network tags for
your environment:
tags field in the node_config block specifies a comma-separated list
of network tags applied to all node VMs.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
node_config {
tags = [ " TAGS " ]
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
TAGS with a comma-separated list of network tags.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
node_config {
tags = [ "group1","production" ]
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Step 9. (Optional) Configure web server network access
The Airflow web server access parameters do not depend on the type of your
environment. Instead, you can configure web server access separately. For
example, a Private IP environment can still have the Airflow UI accessible
from the internet.
You can't configure the allowed IP ranges using private IP addresses.
Caution: In some cases, changes to the web server access parameters can take up
to 10 minutes to propagate.
Console
On the Create environment page:
In the Network configuration section, expand the Show network
configuration item.
In the Web server network access control section:
To provide access to the Airflow web server from all IP addresses,
select Allow access from all IP addresses .
To restrict access only to specific IP ranges, select
Allow access only from specific IP addresses . In the IP range
field, specify an IP range in the CIDR notation. In
the Description field, specify an optional description for this
range. If you want to specify more than one range, click Add IP
range .
To forbid access for all IP addresses, select Allow access only from
specific IP addresses and click Delete item next to the empty
range entry.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
gcloud
When you create an environment, following arguments control web server
access level:
--web-server-allow-all provides access to Airflow from all IP addresses.
This is the default option.
--web-server-allow-ip restricts access only to specific source IP
ranges. To specify several IP ranges, use this argument multiple times.
--web-server-deny-all forbids access for all IP addresses.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--web-server-allow-ip ip_range = WS_IP_RANGE ,description = WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION
Replace:
WS_IP_RANGE with the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access
Airflow UI.
WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION with the description of the IP range.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--web-server-allow-ip ip_range = 192 .0.2.0/24,description = "office net 1" \
--web-server-allow-ip ip_range = 192 .0.4.0/24,description = "office net 3"
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, specify web server
access parameters.
To provide access to the Airflow web server from all IP addresses,
omit webServerNetworkAccessControl .
To restrict access only to specific IP ranges, specify one or more ranges
in allowedIpRanges .
To forbid access for all IP addresses, add allowedIpRanges and make it an
empty list. Do not specify IP ranges in it.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"webServerNetworkAccessControl" : {
"allowedIpRanges" : [
{
"value" : " WS_IP_RANGE " ,
"description" : " WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION "
}
]
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
WS_IP_RANGE with the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access
Airflow UI.
WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION with the description of the IP range.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,

"description" : "office net 3"
}
]
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, the allowed_ip_range block in the
web_server_network_access_control block contains IP ranges that can access
web server.
Note: The Airflow web server of your environment is always
protected by IAM, regardless of the IP ranges that are
allowed to access it.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
web_server_network_access_control {
allowed_ip_range {
value = " WS_IP_RANGE "
description = " WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION "
}
}
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
WS_IP_RANGE with the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access
Airflow UI.
WS_RANGE_DESCRIPTION with the description of the IP range.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
web_server_network_access_control {
allowed_ip_range {
value = "192.0.2.0/24"
description = "office net 1"
},
allowed_ip_range {
value = "192.0.4.0/24"
description = "office net 3"
}
}
node_config {
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
Step 10. (Optional) Specify Airflow configuration overrides and environment variables
You can set up Airflow configuration overrides and
environment variables when you create an environment. As an
alternative, you can do it later, after your environment is created.
Some Airflow configuration options are blocked and you
can't override them.
For the list of available Airflow configuration options, see
Configuration reference for Airflow 2
and Airflow 1.10.*
To specify Airflow configuration overrides and environment variables:
Console
On the Create environment page:
In the Environment variables section, click
Add environment variable .
Enter the Name and Value for the environment variable.
In the Airflow configuration overrides section, click
Add Airflow configuration override .
Enter the Section , Key , and Value for the configuration
option override.
For example:
Section
Key
Value
webserver
dag_orientation
TB
gcloud
When you create an environment, following arguments control environment
variables and Airflow configuration overrides:
--env-variables specifies a comma-separated list of environment
variables.
Variable names may contain upper and lowercase letters, digits, and
underscores, but they may not begin with a digit.
--airflow-configs specifies a comma-separated list of keys and values
for Airflow configuration overrides.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--env-variables ENV_VARS \
--airflow-configs CONFIG_OVERRIDES
Replace:
ENV_VARS with a list of comma-separated NAME=VALUE pairs for
environment variables.
CONFIG_OVERRIDES with a list of comma-separated SECTION-KEY=VALUE
pairs for configuration overrides. Separate the name of the
configuration section with a - symbol, followed by the key name. For
example: core-dags_are_paused_at_creation .
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--env-variables SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM = user@example.com,SENDGRID_API_KEY = example-key \
--airflow-configs core-dags_are_paused_at_creation = True,webserver-dag_orientation = TB
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, specify
environment variables and Airflow configuration overrides.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"softwareConfig" : {
"airflowConfigOverrides" : {
" SECTION - KEY " : " OVERRIDE_VALUE "
},
"envVariables" : {
" VAR_NAME " : " VAR_VALUE " ,
}
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
SECTION with the section in the configuration file where the Airflow
configuration option is located.
KEY with the name of the Airflow configuration option.
OVERRIDE_VALUE with a value of the Airflow configuration option.
VAR_NAME with the name of the environment variable.
VAR_VALUE with the value of the environment variable.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"softwareConfig" : {
"airflowConfigOverrides" : {
"core-dags_are_paused_at_creation" : "True" ,
"webserver-dag_orientation" : "TB"
},
"envVariables" : {
"SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM" : "user@example.com" ,
"SENDGRID_API_KEY" : "example-key"
}
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, following blocks control environment
variables and Airflow configuration overrides:
env_variables block in the software_config block specifies
environment variables.
Variable names may contain upper and lowercase letters, digits, and
underscores, but they may not begin with a digit.
airflow_config_overrides block in the software_config block specifies
Airflow configuration overrides.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
software_config {
airflow_config_overrides = {
SECTION - KEY = " OVERRIDE_VALUE "
}
env_variables = {
VAR_NAME = " VAR_VALUE "
}
}
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
SECTION with the section in the configuration file where the Airflow
configuration option is located.
KEY with the name of the Airflow configuration option.
OVERRIDE_VALUE with a value of the Airflow configuration option.
VAR_NAME with the name of the environment variable.
VAR_VALUE with the value of the environment variable.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
software_config {
airflow_config_overrides = {
core-dags_are_paused_at_creation = "True"
webserver-dag_orientation = "TB"
}
env_variables = {
SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM = "user@example.com"
SENDGRID_API_KEY = "example-key"
}
}
node_config {
service_account = "
example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com
"
}
}
}
Step 11. (Optional) Specify maintenance windows
Default maintenance windows in Cloud Composer 2 are from
00:00:00 to 04:00:00 (GMT) on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday every week.
To specify custom maintenance windows for your environment:
Console
On the Create environment page
Locate the Maintenance windows section.
In the Timezone drop-down list, choose a time zone for maintenance
windows.
Set Start time , Days , and Length , so that:
At least 12 hours of time is allocated in a single week.
You can use several time slots, but each slot duration must be at least
4 hours.
For example, a period of 4 hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
provides the required amount of time.
gcloud
The following arguments define maintenance windows parameters:
--maintenance-window-start sets the start time of a maintenance
window.
--maintenance-window-end sets the end time of a maintenance window.
--maintenance-window-recurrence sets
the maintenance window recurrence .
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--maintenance-window-start ' DATETIME_START ' \
--maintenance-window-end ' DATETIME_END ' \
--maintenance-window-recurrence ' MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE '
Replace:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME with the name of the environment.
DATETIME_START with the start date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the specified time of
the day is used, the specified date is ignored.
DATETIME_END with the end date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the specified time of
the day is used, the specified date is ignored. The specified date and
time must be after the start date.
MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE with
an RFC 5545 RRULE for maintenance
windows recurrence. Cloud Composer supports two formats:
The FREQ=DAILY format specifies a daily recurrence.
The FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA format specifies a
recurrence on selected days of the week.
The following example specifies a 6-hour maintenance window between 01:00 and
07:00 (UTC) on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The 1 January, 2023
date is ignored.
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--maintenance-window-start '2023-01-01T01:00:00Z' \
--maintenance-window-end '2023-01-01T07:00:00Z' \
--maintenance-window-recurrence 'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,WE,SA'
API
When you create an environment, in the
Environment >
EnvironmentConfig resource, specify
maintenance windows parameters:
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"maintenanceWindow" : {
"startTime" : " DATETIME_START " ,
"endTime" : " DATETIME_END " ,
"recurrence" : " MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE "
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
DATETIME_START with the start date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the
specified time of the day is used, the specified date is ignored.
DATETIME_END with the end date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the
specified time of the day is used, the specified date is ignored. The
specified date and time must be after the start date.
MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE with an RFC 5545 RRULE for maintenance windows
recurrence. Cloud Composer supports two formats:
The FREQ=DAILY format specifies a daily recurrence.
The FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA format specifies a
recurrence on selected days of the week.
The following example specifies a 6-hour maintenance window between 01:00 and
07:00 (UTC) on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The 1 January, 2023
date is ignored.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"maintenanceWindow" : {
"startTime" : "2023-01-01T01:00:00Z" ,
"endTime" : "2023-01-01T07:00:00Z" ,
"recurrence" : "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,WE,SA"
},
"nodeConfig" : {
"serviceAccount" : " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Terraform
The maintenance_window block specifies the maintenance windows for your
environment:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
maintenance_window {
start_time = " DATETIME_START "
end_time = " DATETIME_END "
recurrence = " MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE "
}
node_config {
service_account = " SERVICE_ACCOUNT "
}
}
}
Replace:
DATETIME_START with the start date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the
specified time of the day is used, the specified date is ignored.
DATETIME_END with the end date and time in the
date/time input format . Only the
specified time of the day is used, the specified date is ignored. The
specified date and time must be after the start date.
MAINTENANCE_RECURRENCE with an RFC 5545 RRULE for maintenance windows
recurrence. Cloud Composer supports two formats:
The FREQ=DAILY format specifies a daily recurrence.
The FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA format specifies a
recurrence on selected days of the week.
The following example specifies a 6-hour maintenance window between 01:00 and
07:00 (UTC) on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The 1 January, 2023
date is ignored.
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
maintenance_window {
start_time = "2023-01-01T01:00:00Z"
end_time = "2023-01-01T07:00:00Z"
recurrence = "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,WE,SA"
}
}
}
Step 12. (Optional) Data lineage integration
Data lineage is a Knowledge Catalog feature that lets you track data movement.
Data lineage integration is available in
Cloud Composer 2 versions 2.1.2 and later with Airflow versions 2.2.5 and
later.
Data lineage integration is automatically enabled in a new
Cloud Composer environment if the following conditions are met:
Data Lineage API is enabled in your project. For more information, see
Enabling Data Lineage API in
Knowledge Catalog documentation.
Caution: After you enable Data Lineage API, Knowledge Catalog
automatically starts ingesting data for BigQuery,
Cloud Data Fusion, Managed Service for Apache Spark. This happens even if you don't
create a Cloud Composer environment with data lineage
integration.
A custom Lineage Backend isn't configured in
Airflow.
You can disable data lineage integration when you create an environment. For
example, if you want to override the automatic behavior or choose to
enable data lineage later , after the environment is
created.
Console
To disable Data lineage integration, on the Create environment page:
In the Advanced configuration section, expand
the Show advanced configuration item.
In the Dataplex data lineage integration section, select
Disable integration with Dataplex data lineage .
gcloud
When you create an environment, the --disable-cloud-data-lineage-integration
argument disables the data lineage integration.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--disable-cloud-data-lineage-integration
Replace:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME with the name of the environment.
LOCATION with the region where the environment is located.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--disable-cloud-data-lineage-integration
Step 13. (Optional) Configure data encryption (CMEK)
By default, data in your environment is encrypted with a key provided by
Google.
To use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) to encrypt data in your
environment, follow the instructions outlined in
Using customer-managed encryption keys .
Step 14. (Optional) Use a custom environment's bucket
Warning: Because your environment runs DAGs on behalf of your environment's service account, users who can add and modify DAGs in the custom environment's bucket can run their code on behalf of the environment's service account and
exercise all permissions of this account . Make sure that you are familiar
with
security considerations for environment's service accounts
and understand how this account interacts with permissions and roles that you
grant to individual users in your project.
When you create an environment, Cloud Composer creates a bucket for
your environment automatically.
As an alternative, you can specify a custom Cloud Storage bucket from your
project. Your environment uses this bucket in the same way as the automatically
created bucket.
To use a custom environment bucket, follow the instructions outlined in
Use a custom environment's bucket .
Step 15. (Optional) Specify environment labels
You can assign labels to your environments to
break down billing costs based on these labels .
Console
On the Create environment page, in the Labels section:
Click Add label .
In Key and Value fields, specify key and value pairs for the
environment labels.
gcloud
When you create an environment, the --labels argument specifies a comma-separated list of keys and values with environment labels.
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account " SERVICE_ACCOUNT " \
--labels LABELS
Replace:
LABELS with a list of comma-separated KEY=VALUE pairs for environment
labels.
Example:
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-2.16.10-airflow-2.10.5 \
--service-account "
example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com
" \
--labels owner = engineering-team,env = production
API
When you create an environment, in the Environment
resource, specify labels for your environment.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"labels" : {
" LABEL_KEY " : " LABEL_VALUE "
}
}
Replace:
LABEL_KEY with a key of the environment label.
LABEL_VALUE with a value of the environment label.
Example:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" ,
"labels" : {
"owner" : "engineering-team" ,
"env" : "production"
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, specify labels in the labels block (
outside of the config block).
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
labels = {
LABEL_KEY = " LABEL_VALUE "
}
}
Replace:
LABEL_KEY with a key of the environment label.
LABEL_VALUE with a value of the environment label.
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
labels = {
owner = "engineering-team"
env = "production"
}
}
