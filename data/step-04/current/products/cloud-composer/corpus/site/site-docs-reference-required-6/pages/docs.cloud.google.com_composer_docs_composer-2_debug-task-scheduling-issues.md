This tutorial guides you through diagnosing and troubleshooting task scheduling
and parsing issues that lead to scheduler malfunctioning, parsing errors and
latency, and task failure.
Introduction
The Airflow scheduler is primarily impacted by two factors: task scheduling and
DAG parsing. Issues in one of those factors can have a negative impact on the
environment health and performance.
Sometimes too many tasks are scheduled simultaneously. In this situation, the
queue is filled up, and tasks remain in the "scheduled" state or become
rescheduled after being queued, which might cause task failure and performance
latency.
Another common issue is parsing latency and errors caused by the complexity of
a DAG code. For example, a DAG code that contains Airflow variables at the top
level of the code can lead to parsing delays, database overload, scheduling
failures, and DAG timeouts.
In this tutorial, you will diagnose the example DAGs and learn how to
troubleshoot scheduling and parsing problems, improve DAG scheduling, and
optimize your DAG code and environment configurations to improve performance.

Costs
This tutorial uses the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Cloud Composer (see
additional costs )
Cloud Monitoring
When you finish this tutorial, you can avoid continued billing by deleting the
resources you created. For more details, see Clean up .
Before you begin
This section describes actions that are required before you start the tutorial.
Create and configure a project
For this tutorial, you need a Google Cloud
project .
Configure the project in the following way:
In the Google Cloud console, select or create a project :
Go to Project Selector
Make sure that billing is enabled for your project. Learn how to check if billing is enabled on a project .
Make sure that your Google Cloud project user has the following roles to create the necessary resources:
Environment and Storage Object Administrator
( roles/composer.environmentAndStorageObjectAdmin )
Compute Admin ( roles/compute.admin )
Enable APIs for your project
Enable the Cloud Composer API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Create your Cloud Composer environment
Create a Cloud Composer 2 environment .
Important: Make sure that you use the Small environment preset in order to
reproduce the errors when using the examples provided further in this tutorial. This is the default preset when creating an environment through
Google Cloud console.
As a part of creating the environment ,
you grant the Cloud Composer v2 API Service Agent Extension
( roles/composer.ServiceAgentV2Ext ) role to the Composer Service Agent
account. Cloud Composer uses this account to perform operations
in your Google Cloud project.
Example: Scheduler malfunctioning and task failure because of task scheduling issues
This example demonstrates debugging scheduler malfunctioning and latency caused
by high task concurrency.
Upload the sample DAG to your environment
Upload the following sample DAG to the environment
that you created in the previous steps. In this tutorial, this DAG is named
dag_10_tasks_200_seconds_1 .
This DAG has 200 tasks. Each task waits for 1 second and prints "Complete!".
The DAG is triggered automatically once uploaded. Cloud Composer runs this DAG 10 times, and all DAG runs happen in parallel.
Warning: This DAG simulates issues with DAG scheduling , which can
potentially disrupt operations in your environment.
import time
from datetime import datetime , timedelta
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.decorators import task
tasks_amount = 200
seconds = 1
minutes = 5
with DAG (
dag_id = f "dag_10_tasks_ { tasks_amount } _sec_ { seconds } " ,
start_date = datetime ( 2023 , 11 , 22 , 20 , 0 ),
end_date = datetime ( 2023 , 11 , 22 , 20 , 49 ),
schedule = timedelta ( minutes = minutes ),
catchup = True ,
) as dag :
@task
def create_subtasks ( seconds : int ) - > None :
time . sleep ( seconds )
for i in range ( tasks_amount ):
create_subtasks ( seconds )
Diagnose the scheduler malfunctioning and task failure issues
After the DAG runs complete, open Airflow UI, and click the
dag_10_tasks_200_seconds_1 DAG. You will see that 10 total DAG runs were
successful, and each has 200 tasks that succeeded.
Review the Airflow task logs:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
In the list of environments, click the name of your environment.
The Environment details page opens.
Go to the Logs tab, then go to All logs >
Airflow logs > Workers >
View in Logs Explorer .
On the logs histogram, you can see the errors and warnings indicated with red
and orange colors:
Figure 1. Airflow worker logs histogram (click to enlarge)
The example DAG resulted in about 130 warnings and 60 errors. Click any
column that contains yellow and red bars. You will see some of the following
warnings and errors in the logs:
State of this instance has been externally set to success. Terminating
instance.
Received SIGTERM. Terminating subprocesses.
worker: Warm shutdown (MainProcess).
These logs might indicate that the resource usage exceeded the limits and the
worker restarted itself.
If an Airflow task is kept in the queue for too long then the scheduler marks
it as failed and up_for_retry and is going to reschedule it once again for
execution. One way to observe the symptoms of this situation is to look at the
chart with the number of queued tasks and if the spikes in this chart don't
drop in about 10 minutes, then there will likely be failures of tasks (with no
logs).
Review the monitoring information:
Go to the Monitoring tab and select Overview .
Review the Airflow tasks graph.
Figure 2. Airflow tasks graph (click to enlarge)
In the Airflow tasks graph, there is a spike in queued tasks that lasts for
more than 10 minutes, which might mean that there are not enough resources
in your environment to process all scheduled tasks.
Review the Active workers graph:
Figure 3. Active workers graph (click to enlarge)
The Active workers graph indicates that the DAG triggered autoscaling
to the maximum allowed limit of three workers during the DAG run.
Resource usage graphs can indicate the lack of capacity in Airflow workers
to run queued tasks. On the Monitoring tab, select Workers and
review Total worker CPU usage and Total worker memory usage graphs.
Figure 4. Total workers CPU usage graph (click to enlarge)
Figure 5. Total workers memory usage graph (click to enlarge)
The graphs indicate that the execution of too many tasks simultaneously
resulted in hitting the CPU limit. The resources had been used for over 30
minutes, which is even longer than the total duration of 200 tasks in 10
DAG runs running one by one.
These are the indicators of the queue being filled up and a lack of resources
to process all scheduled tasks.
Consolidate your tasks
The current code creates many DAGs and tasks with no sufficient resources to
process all tasks in parallel, which results in the queue being filled up.
Keeping tasks in the queue for too long may cause tasks to reschedule or fail.
In such situations, you should opt for a smaller number of more consolidated
tasks.
The following sample DAG changes the number of tasks in the initial example
from 200 to 20 and increase the wait time from 1 to 10 seconds to imitate more
consolidated tasks that do the same amount of work.
Upload the following sample DAG to the environment
that you created. In this tutorial, this DAG is named
dag_10_tasks_20_seconds_10 .
Warning: This DAG simulates issues with DAG scheduling , which can
potentially disrupt operations in your environment.
import time
from datetime import datetime , timedelta
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.decorators import task
tasks_amount = 20
seconds = 10
minutes = 5
with DAG (
dag_id = f "dag_10_tasks_ { tasks_amount } _sec_ { seconds } " ,
start_date = datetime ( 2021 , 12 , 22 , 20 , 0 ),
end_date = datetime ( 2021 , 12 , 22 , 20 , 49 ),
schedule = timedelta ( minutes = minutes ),
catchup = True ,
) as dag :
@task
def create_subtasks ( seconds : int ) - > None :
time . sleep ( seconds )
for i in range ( tasks_amount ):
create_subtasks ( seconds )
Evaluate the impact of more consolidated tasks on scheduling processes:
Wait until the DAG runs are completed.
In the Airflow UI, on the DAGs page, click the
dag_10_tasks_20_seconds_10 DAG. You will see 10 DAG runs, each has 20
tasks that succeeded.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
In the list of environments, click the name of your environment.
The Environment details page opens.
Go to the Logs tab, then go to All logs >
Airflow logs > Workers >
View in Logs Explorer .
The second example with more consolidated tasks resulted in approximately
10 warnings and 7 errors. On the histogram, you can compare the number of
errors and warnings in the initial example (earlier values) and the second
example (later values).
Figure 6. Airflow worker logs histogram after the
tasks were consolidated (click to enlarge)
When comparing the first example with the more consolidated one, you can
see that there are significantly fewer errors and warnings in the second
example. However, the same errors related to warm shutdown still appear in
the logs because of resource overload.
On the Monitoring tab, select Workers and review the graphs.
When you compare the Airflow tasks graph for the first example (earlier
values) with the graph for the second example with more consolidated tasks,
you can see that the spike in queued tasks lasted for a shorter period of
time when the tasks were more consolidated. However, it lasted close to 10
minutes, which is still sub-optimal.
Figure 7. Airflow tasks graph after the
tasks were consolidated (click to enlarge)
On the Active workers graph, you can see the first example (on the left
side of the graph) used resources for a much more extended period of time
than the second one, even though both examples imitate the same amount of
work.
Figure 8. Active workers graph after the
tasks were consolidated (click to enlarge)
Review the worker resource consumption graphs. Even though the difference
between the resources used in the example with more consolidated tasks and
the initial example is quite significant, the CPU usage is still spiking
to 70% of the limit.

tasks were consolidated (click to enlarge)
Figure 10. Total workers memory usage graph after
the tasks were consolidated (click to enlarge)
Distribute tasks more evenly over time
Too many concurrent tasks result in the queue being filled up, which leads to
tasks being stuck in the queue or rescheduled. In the previous steps, you
decreased the number of tasks by consolidating those tasks, however, the output
logs and monitoring indicated that the number of concurrent tasks is still
sub-optimal.
You can control the number of concurrent task runs by implementing a schedule
or setting limits for how many tasks can be run simultaneously.
In this tutorial, you distribute tasks more evenly over time by adding
DAG-level parameters into the dag_10_tasks_20_seconds_10 DAG:
Add max_active_runs=1 argument to the DAG context manager. This argument
sets a limit of only a single instance of a DAG run in a given moment.
Add max_active_tasks=5 argument to the DAG context manager. This argument
controls the maximum number of task instances that can run concurrently in
each DAG.
Upload the following sample DAG to the environment
that you created. In this tutorial, this DAG is named
dag_10_tasks_20_seconds_10_scheduled.py .
import time
from datetime import datetime , timedelta
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.decorators import task
tasks_amount = 20
seconds = 10
minutes = 5
active_runs = 1
active_tasks = 5
with DAG (
dag_id = f "dag_10_tasks_ { tasks_amount } _sec_ { seconds } _runs_ { active_runs } _tasks_ { active_tasks } " ,
start_date = datetime ( 2021 , 12 , 22 , 20 , 0 ),
end_date = datetime ( 2021 , 12 , 22 , 20 , 49 ),
schedule = timedelta ( minutes = minutes ),
max_active_runs = active_runs ,
max_active_tasks = active_tasks ,
catchup = True ,
) as dag :
@task
def create_subtasks ( seconds : int ) - > None :
time . sleep ( seconds )
for i in range ( tasks_amount ):
create_subtasks ( seconds )
Evaluate the impact of distributing tasks over time on scheduling processes:
Wait until the DAG runs are completed.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
In the list of environments, click the name of your environment.
The Environment details page opens.
Go to the Logs tab, then go to All logs >
Airflow logs > Workers >
View in Logs Explorer .
On the histogram, you can see that the third DAG with a limited number of
active tasks and runs did not generate any warnings or errors and the
distribution of logs looks more even compared to the previous values.
Figure 11. Airflow worker logs histogram after the
tasks were consolidated and distributed over time (click to enlarge)
The tasks in the dag_10_tasks_20_seconds_10_scheduled example that has a
limited number of active tasks and runs did not cause resource pressure because
the tasks were queued evenly.
After you performed the described steps, you optimized the resource usage by
consolidating small tasks and distributing them more evenly over time.
Optimize environment configurations
You can adjust your environment configurations to make sure there is always capacity in Airflow workers to run queued tasks.
Number of workers and worker concurrency
You can adjust the maximum number of workers
to make Cloud Composer automatically scale your environment within
the set limits.
The [celery]worker_concurrency parameter defines the maximum number of tasks
a single worker can pick up from the task queue. Changing this parameter
adjusts the number of tasks that a single worker can execute at the same time.
You can change this Airflow configuration option by
overriding it . By default, the worker concurrency is set based on the number of lightweight concurrent task instances that a worker can
accommodate. This means that its value is dependent on worker resource limits.
The worker concurrency value doesn't depend on the number of workers in your
environment.
The number of workers and worker concurrency work in combination with each
other, and your environment performance is highly dependent on both parameters.
You can use the following considerations to pick the correct combination:
Multiple quick tasks running in parallel . You can increase worker
concurrency when there are tasks waiting in the queue, and your workers use
a low percentage of their CPUs and memory at the same time. However, under
certain circumstances the queue might never fill up, causing autoscaling to
never trigger. If small tasks finish execution by the time the new workers
are ready, an existing worker can pick up the remaining tasks, and there
will be no tasks for newly created workers.
In these situations, it is recommended to
increase the minimum number of workers and increase worker concurrency
to avoid overeager scaling.
Multiple long tasks running in parallel . The high worker concurrency
prevents the system from scaling the number of workers. If multiple tasks
are resource-intensive and take a long time to complete, a high worker
concurrency can lead to the queue never being filled up and all tasks being
picked up by just one worker, which results in performance issues. In these
situations, it is recommended to
increase the maximum number of workers and decrease worker concurrency .
Important: There are scenarios where setting the [celery]worker_concurrency
parameter to a higher value might not be optimal for your environment. Before
modifying worker concurrency settings, check
performance considerations .
The importance of parallelism
Airflow schedulers control the scheduling of DAG runs and individual tasks from
DAGs. The [core]parallelism Airflow configuration option controls how many
tasks the Airflow scheduler can queue in the executor's queue after all
dependencies for these tasks are met.
Parallelism is a protective mechanism of Airflow that determines how many tasks
can be run at the same time per each scheduler, regardless of the worker count.
The parallelism value, multiplied by the number of schedulers in your cluster,
is the maximum number of task instances that your environment can queue.
Usually, [core]parallelism is set as a product of a maximum number of workers
and [celery]worker_concurrency . It is also affected by the
pool .
You can change this Airflow configuration option by
overriding it . For more information about adjusting Airflow
configurations related to scaling, see
Scaling Airflow configuration .
Find optimal environment configurations
The recommended way to fix scheduling issues is consolidating small tasks into
larger tasks and distributing tasks more evenly over time. In addition to
optimizing DAG code, you can also optimize environment configurations to have a
sufficient capacity for running multiple tasks concurrently.
For example, assume you consolidate tasks in your DAG
as much as possible but limiting active tasks to spread them more evenly over
time is not a preferred solution for your specific use case.
You can adjust parallelism, number of workers, and worker concurrency
parameters to run the dag_10_tasks_20_seconds_10 DAG without limiting active
tasks. In this example, DAG runs 10 times and each run contains 20 small tasks.
If you want to run them all simultaneously:
You will need a larger environment size, because it controls performance
parameters of the managed Cloud Composer infrastructure of your environment.
Airflow workers must to be able to run 20 tasks simultaneously, which means
you need to set worker concurrency to 20.
The workers need sufficient CPU and memory to handle all tasks. Worker
concurrency is affected by worker CPU and memory, thus, you will need at
least worker_concurrency / 12 in CPU and at least worker_concurrency / 8
in memory.
You will need to increase parallelism to match the higher worker concurrency.
In order for workers to pick up 20 tasks from the queue, the scheduler will
need to schedule those 20 tasks first.
Adjust your environment configurations in the following way:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
In the list of environments, click the name of your environment.
The Environment details page opens.
Go to the Environment configuration tab.
Find the Resources > Workloads configuration and
click Edit .
In the Worker section, in the Memory field, specify the new memory
limit for Airflow workers. In this tutorial, use 4 GB.
In the CPU field, specify the new CPU limit for Airflow workers. In this
tutorial, use 2 vCPU.
Save the changes and allow several minutes for your Airflow workers to
restart.
Next, override parallelism and worker concurrency Airflow configuration options:
Go to the Airflow Configuration Overrides tab.
Click Edit , then click Add Airflow Configuration Override .
Override the parralelism configuration:
Section

Value
core

20
Click Add Airflow Configuration Override and override the worker
concurrency configuration:
Section
Key
Value
celery
worker_concurrency
20
Click Save and wait until the environment updates its configuration.
Trigger the same example DAG again with the adjusted configurations:
In the Airflow UI, go to the DAGs page.
Find the dag_10_tasks_20_seconds_10 DAG and delete it.
After the DAG is deleted, Airflow checks the DAGs folder in your
environment's bucket and automatically runs the DAG again.
After the DAG runs are completed, review the Logs histogram again. On diagram,
you can see that the dag_10_tasks_20_seconds_10 example with more
consolidated tasks did not generate any errors and warnings when running with
the adjusted environment configuration. Compare the results to the earlier data
on the diagram, where the same example generated errors and warnings when
running with tge default environment configuration.
Figure 12. Airflow worker logs histogram after the environment configuration was adjusted (click to enlarge)
Environment configurations and Airflow configurations play a crucial role in
task scheduling, however, it is not possible to increase the configurations
beyond certain limits.
We recommend to optimize the DAG code, consolidate tasks, and use scheduling
for optimized performance and efficiency.
Example: DAG parsing errors and latency because of complex DAG code
In this example, you investigate the parsing latency of a sample DAG that
imitates an excess of Airflow variables.
Create a new Airflow variable
Before you upload the sample code, create a new Airflow variable.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
In the Airflow webserver column, follow the Airflow link for your
environment.
Go to Admin > Variables >
Add a new record .
Set the following values:
key: example_var
val: test_airflow_variable
Upload the sample DAG to your environment
Upload the following sample DAG to the environment
that you created in the previous steps. In this tutorial, this DAG is named
dag_for_loop_airflow_variable .
This DAG contains a for loop that runs 1,000 times and imitates an excess of
Airflow variables. Each iteration reads the example_var variable and
generates a task. Each task contains one command that prints the variable's
value.
Warning: This DAG simulates issues with DAG scheduling , which can
potentially disrupt operations in your environment.
from datetime import datetime
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator
from airflow.models import Variable
default_args = {
'owner' : 'airflow' ,
'depends_on_past' : False ,
'start_date' : datetime ( 2023 , 2 , 17 ),
'retries' : 0
}
dag = DAG (
'dag_for_loop_airflow_variable' ,
default_args = default_args ,
catchup = False ,
schedule = "@daily"
)
for i in range ( 1000 ):
a = Variable . get ( 'example_var' , 'N/A' )
task = BashOperator (
task_id = f 'task_ { i } ' ,
bash_command = 'echo variable foo=$ {foo_env} ' ,
dag = dag ,
env = { 'foo_env' : a }
)
Diagnose the parsing issues
DAG parse time is the amount of time it takes for the Airflow scheduler to read
a DAG file and parse it. Before the Airflow scheduler can schedule any task
from a DAG, the scheduler must parse the DAG file to discover the structure of
the DAG and defined tasks.
If a DAG takes a long time to parse, this consumes the scheduler's capacity and
might reduce the performance of DAG runs.
To monitor the DAG parse time:
Run the dags report Airflow CLI command in
gcloud CLI to see the parse time for all your DAGs:
gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
dags report
Replace the following:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME : the name of your environment.
LOCATION : the region where the environment is located.
In the command's output, look for the duration value for the
dag_for_loop_airflow_variables DAG. A large value might indicate that
this DAG is not implemented in an optimal way. If you have multiple DAGs,
from the output table, you can identify which DAGs have a long parsing time.
Example:
file | duration | dag_num | task_num | dags
====================+================+=========+==========+=====================
/dag_for_loop_airfl | 0:00:14.773594 | 1 | 1000 | dag_for_loop_airflow
ow_variable.py | | | | _variable
/airflow_monitoring | 0:00:00.003035 | 1 | 1 | airflow_monitoring
.py
Inspect DAG parse times in Google Cloud console:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
In the list of environments, click the name of your environment.
The Environment details page opens.
Go to the Logs tab, then go to All logs >
DAG processor manager .
Review dag-processor-manager logs and identify possible issues.
Figure 13. DAG processor manager logs show DAG
parse times (click to enlarge)
If the total DAG parse time exceeds about 10 seconds, your schedulers might be
overloaded with DAG parsing and cannot run DAGs effectively.
Optimize the DAG code
It is
recommended
to avoid unnecessary "top-level" Python code in your DAGs. DAGs with many
imports, variables, and functions outside of the DAG introduce greater parse
times for the Airflow scheduler. This reduces performance and scalability of
Cloud Composer and Airflow. Excess of Airflow variables reading
leads to long parsing time and high database load. If this code is in a DAG
file, these functions execute on every scheduler heartbeat, which may be slow.
Airflow's template fields allow you to incorporate values from Airflow
variables and Jinja templates into your DAGs. This prevents unnecessary
function execution during scheduler heartbeats.
To implement the DAG example in a better way, avoid using Airflow variables at
the top-level Python code of DAGs. Instead, pass Airflow variables to existing
operators throguh a Jinja template, which will delay reading the value until
the task execution.
Upload the new version of the sample DAG to your
environment. In this tutorial, this DAG is named
dag_for_loop_airflow_variable_optimized .
Warning: This DAG simulates issues with DAG scheduling , which can
potentially disrupt operations in your environment.
from datetime import datetime
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator
default_args = {
'owner' : 'airflow' ,
'depends_on_past' : False ,
'start_date' : datetime ( 2023 , 2 , 17 ),
'retries' : 0
}
dag = DAG (
'dag_for_loop_airflow_variable_optimized' ,
default_args = default_args ,
catchup = False ,
schedule = '@daily'
)
for i in range ( 1000 ):
task = BashOperator (
task_id = f 'bash_use_variable_good_ { i } ' ,
bash_command = 'echo variable foo=$ {foo_env} ' ,
dag = dag ,
env = { 'foo_env' : '{{ var.value.get("example_var") }}' },
)
Inspect the new DAG parse time:
Wait until the DAG run is completed.
Run the dags report command again to see the
parse time for all your DAGs:
file | duration | dag_num | task_num | dags
====================+================+=========+==========+=====================
/dag_for_loop_airfl | 0:00:37.000369 | 1 | 1000 | dag_for_loop_airflow
ow_variable.py | | | | _variable
/dag_for_loop_airfl | 0:00:01.109457 | 1 | 1000 | dag_for_loop_airflow

ed.py | | | |
/airflow_monitoring | 0:00:00.040510 | 1 | 1 | airflow_monitoring
.py | | | |
Review dag-processor-manager logs again and
analyze the parse duration.
Figure 14. DAG processor manager logs show DAG
parse times after the DAG code was optimized (click to enlarge)
By replacing the environment variables with Airflow templates, you simplified
the DAG code and reduced the parsing latency by about ten times.
Optimize Airflow environment configurations
The Airflow scheduler constantly tries to trigger new tasks and parses all DAGs
in your environment bucket. If your DAGs have a long parsing time and the
scheduler consumes a lot of resources, you can optimize Airflow scheduler
configurations in order for the scheduler to use resources more efficiently.
In this tutorial, the DAG files take a lot of time to parse, and parsing cycles
start to overlap, which then exhausts the scheduler's capacity. In our example,
the first example DAG takes more than 5 seconds to parse, so you will configure
the scheduler to run less frequently to use resources more efficiently. You
will override the
scheduler_heartbeat_sec
Airflow configuration option. This configuration defines how often the
scheduler should run (in seconds). By default, the value is set to 5 seconds.
You can change this Airflow configuration option by
overriding it .
Override the scheduler_heartbeat_sec Airflow configuration option:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
In the list of environments, click the name of your environment.
The Environment details page opens.
Go to the Airflow Configuration Overrides tab.
Click Edit , then click Add Airflow Configuration Override .
Override the Airflow configuration option:

Click Save and wait until the environment updates its configuration.
Check the scheduler metrics:
Go to the Monitoring tab and select Schedulers .
In the Scheduler heartbeat graph, click the More options button
(three dots) and then click View in the Metrics Explorer .
Figure 15. Scheduler heartbeat graph (click to enlarge)
On the graph, you will see the scheduler runs twice less frequently after you
changed the default configuration from 5 seconds to 10 seconds. By reducing the
frequency of heartbeats, you make sure that the scheduler does not start
running while the previous parsing cycle is ongoing and the scheduler's
resource capacity is not exhausted.
Assign more resources to the scheduler
In Cloud Composer 2, you can allocate more CPU and memory resources to the
scheduler. In this way, you can increase the performance of your scheduler and
accelerate parsing time for your DAG.
Allocate additional CPU and memory to the scheduler:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
In the list of environments, click the name of your environment.
The Environment details page opens.
Go to the Environment configuration tab.
Find the Resources > Workloads configuration and
click Edit .
In the Scheduler section, in the Memory field, specify the new memory
limit. In this tutorial, use 4 GB.
In the CPU field, specify the new CPU limit. In this
tutorial, use 2 vCPU.
Save the changes and allow several minutes for your Airflow schedulers to
restart.
Go to the Logs tab, then go to All logs >
DAG processor manager .
Review dag-processor-manager logs and compare the parse duration for the
example DAGs:
Figure 16. DAG processor manager logs show DAG
parse times after more resources were assigned to the scheduler (click to enlarge)
By assigning more resources to the scheduler, you increased the scheduler's
capacity and reduced the parsing latency significantly compared to the default
environment configurations. With more resources, the scheduler can parse the
DAGs faster, however, the costs associated with Cloud Composer
resources will also increase. Additionally, it is not possible to increase the
resources beyond a certain limit.
We recommend to allocate resources only after the possible DAG code and
Airflow configuration optimizations were implemented.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources
used in this tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources
or keep the project and delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Delete individual resources
If you plan to explore multiple tutorials and quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete the Cloud Composer environment . You also
delete the environment's bucket during this procedure.
