On September 15, 2026 , all Cloud Composer 1 versions and versions 2.0.x of Cloud Composer 2 will reach their planned end of life . You will not be able to use environments with these versions. We recommend planning migration to Cloud Composer 3 . Cloud Composer 2 versions 2.1.x and later are still supported and are not impacted by this change.

This page describes the access control options available to you in
Cloud Composer and explains how to grant roles.
For information about granting roles, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
With Airflow UI Access Control , you can control permissions
for the Airflow UI and DAG UI beyond enabling or disabling access to it.
If you want to set up access for external identities through
workforce identity federation , see
Access environments with workforce identity federation .
About Identity and Access Management in Cloud Composer
Cloud Composer uses Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access
control.
You control access to different Cloud Composer features by
granting roles and permissions both for
IAM service accounts and for
user accounts in your Google Cloud project.
Cloud Composer uses two types of IAM service
accounts:
Cloud Composer Service Agent account
Environment's service account
In addition to these two types of service account,
Google APIs Service Agent runs internal Google
processes on your behalf.
Grant roles to Cloud Composer Service Agent account
In your Google Cloud project, Cloud Composer service creates
a service agent, the Cloud Composer Service Agent , to manage
resources related to Cloud Composer.
The Cloud Composer Service Agent is used for all environments in your
project. By default, the Cloud Composer Service Agent account has
only the Cloud Composer API Service Agent role. Keep this role on this
service account.
Note: The Google APIs Service Agent account (also known as Cloud Services
Service Account) runs internal Google processes on your behalf. We
recommend to keep the default permissions on this Service Agent account, which is the Project Editor role.
Cloud Composer 2 uses
GKE Autopilot , which requires
Workload Identity .
To support Workload Identity, the
service account of your environment must have bindings
to the Kubernetes service account that runs your environment's cluster. These
bindings are needed so that pods of your environment cluster can access
resources of your Google Cloud project. For example, to read DAG
definition files from the environment's bucket.
To create bindings between your environment's service account and the
Kubernetes service account of your environment's cluster, the Composer Service
Agent account must have enough permissions to do so. This requires
iam.serviceAccounts.getIamPolicy and iam.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy
permissions, which are provided by
the Cloud Composer v2 API Service Agent Extension
( roles/composer.ServiceAgentV2Ext ) role.
This role is not granted automatically . You must grant it manually. For
instructions on granting this role, see
Grant required permissions to Cloud Composer service account .
Warning: After you grant this role, the Composer Service Agent account
can modify the IAM policy of your
environment's service account . Cloud Composer uses these
permissions to create bindings between your environment's service account and
the Kubernetes service account of your environment's cluster.
Grant roles to an environment's service account
Warning: Before you specify a service account for an environment, make sure to
get familiar with all security considerations that
apply to environment service accounts.
When you create an environment, you specify a service account. This service
account is called environment's service account . You cannot change the
specified service account after an environment is created.
Your environment uses this service account to perform most of the operations,
for example:
Running Pods with different environment components , such as
Airflow workers and schedulers, in your environment's cluster.
Executing DAGs on behalf of this service account. For example, if a DAG
accesses another Google service, this is done on behalf of the service
account.
Building the images of Airflow components when custom PyPI packages are
installed in the environment.
Reading and writing objects in the environment's bucket. For example, when
synchronizing files between the environment's bucket and Airflow components.
Running Pods launched through KubernetesPodOperator and GKEStartPodOperator.
Cloud Composer binds this service account to the Kubernetes service
account of your environment. Nodes in your environment's cluster run as the
Kubernetes service account and use the bindings to access resources in your
Google Cloud project, such as DAG files in your environment's bucket.
Thus, if you want your environment to access other resources in your
Google Cloud project, grant permissions to the service account of your
environment (IAM service account), and not to the Kubernetes
service account.
Caution: If you delete an environment's service account, all environments
that use it stop working and cannot be recovered. Even if a service account
with the same name is created again, it is not possible to recover the affected
environments. It is still possible to access data stored in the affected
environment's buckets.
Existing and custom service accounts for your environment
We strongly recommend to set up a user-managed service account
and use it for Cloud Composer environments. To do so:
Create a new service account as described in
the Identity and Access Management documentation.
Grant it the Composer Worker ( composer.worker ) role.
If your environment
uses resource location restrictions ,
or installs PyPI packages
from an Artifact Registry repository or
from a private repository , then grant
the Service Account User ( iam.serviceAccountUser ) role to the
user-managed service account that runs your environment on itself
(both the principal and the resource are the same service account).
To access other resources in your Google Cloud project, grant
extra permissions to access those resources to this service account.
The Composer Worker ( composer.worker ) role provides this required set
of permissions in most cases. Add extra permissions to this service account
only when it's necessary for the operation of your DAGs.
Security considerations for environment service accounts
Warning: Your environment's service account can have
too broad permissions on your project . Because your environment runs DAGs on
behalf of your environment's service account, users who can
add and modify DAGs and other files in your environment's bucket
or modify Artifact Registry repositories in your
project
can run their code on behalf of the environment's service account and
exercise all permissions of this account .
We strongly recommend to
set up a user-managed service account for
Cloud Composer environments that has only the required set of
permissions that are necessary to run the environment and perform
operations defined in your DAGs. The Composer Worker
( composer.worker ) role provides this required set of permissions in most
cases. Add extra permissions to this service account only when it's
necessary for the operation of your DAGs.
It is possible to create Cloud Composer environments that use the
default Compute Engine service account .
This account usually has more more permissions than it's necessary to run
Cloud Composer environments or DAGs. Because your environment
runs DAGs on behalf of its service account, this creates a risk of DAGs
using broader permissions than intended. At the same time, it's often not
possible to reduce permissions of this service account without impacting
other services that might use it in your project. Instead,
set up a user-managed service account .
Make sure to grant read-write access to your environment's
bucket only to trusted users.
Because the environment's service account is used to run DAGs, users who can
add and modify DAGs (or other objects such as Python dependencies) in the
environment's bucket can run their code on behalf of the environment's
service account and get access to all its permissions through deploying
their own versions of DAGs. This might happen even if their user accounts
don't have explicit Cloud Composer-related roles and
permissions that allow such actions.
Make sure to grant access to Artifact Registry repositories in your project
only to trusted users.
Airflow components of your environment use container images stored in these
repositories and it's possible to use a custom container image with
KubernetesPodOperator, GKEPodOperator, or GKEStartPodOperator from a DAG.
These users can either deploy their own versions of container images for
Airflow components of your environment (such as Airflow workers), or run a
DAG that uses one of the listed operators to run an uploaded container
image. As a result, these users can run their code on behalf of the
environment's service account and get access to all its permissions.
Make sure to allow only trusted users to update environments in your project.
The composer.environments.update permission can be used
beyond just applying configuration changes. It provides broad control over
Cloud Composer resources, including code execution on behalf of
the environment's service account, which can exercise all permissions that
this service account has. For example, the installation of PyPI packages
involves executing Python code from the package. As another example,
environment variables might be used to store the code to be executed by a
DAG, or point to a location with such code.
Make sure to allow only trusted users to
run Airflow CLI commands in your project.
The composer.environments.executeairflowcommand permission
can be used to execute Python code available to Airflow components on
behalf of environment's service account.
Grant roles to users
To trigger an environment operation, a user must have enough permissions.
For example, if you want to create a new environment, you must
have the composer.environments.create permission.
For Cloud Composer, individual permissions are grouped into
predefined roles. You can grant these roles to principals.
Note: For a list of permissions in predefined roles for
Cloud Composer, see Roles .
If your user account has the Project Editor role, then you can execute
all environment operations. However, this role has broad permissions. For users
that work with environments, we recommend to use roles that are specific to
Cloud Composer. In this way, you can narrow the scope of
permissions and provide different access levels to different principals. For
example, one user can have permissions to create, update, upgrade, and delete
environments, while another user can only view environments and access the
Airflow web interface.
Depending on the level of access that you want to provide for
Cloud Composer environments, grant the following permissions to
principals.
Manage environments and environment buckets
For a user that can view, create, update, upgrade, and delete
environments, manage objects (such as DAG files) in the environment buckets,
access the Airflow web interface, run Airflow CLI commands,
view and trigger DAGs from the DAG UI :
Grant the Environment and Storage Object Administrator
( composer.environmentAndStorageObjectAdmin ) role.
Grant the Service Account User ( iam.serviceAccountUser ) role.
To narrow down permissions for a user, grant this role only on the
service account of your environment . For more
information, see
Grant or revoke a single role .
Grant the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission on the
service account of your environment .
Manage environments
For a user that can view, create, update, upgrade, and delete
environments, access the Airflow web interface, run Airflow CLI commands,
view and trigger DAGs from the DAG UI :
Grant the Composer Administrator ( composer.admin ) role.
Grant the Service Account User ( iam.serviceAccountUser ) role.
To narrow down permissions for a user, grant this role only on the
service account of your environment . For more
information, see
Grant or revoke a single role .
Grant the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission on the
service account of your environment .
View environments and manage environment buckets
For a user that can view environments, access the Airflow web
interface, view and trigger DAGs from the DAG UI , and manage objects in the environment buckets (for example, to
upload new DAG files):
Grant the Environment User and Storage Object Viewer
( composer.environmentAndStorageObjectViewer ) role.
Grant the Storage Object Admin ( storage.objectAdmin ) role.
View environments and environment buckets
For a user that can view environments, access the Airflow
web interface, view and trigger DAGs from the DAG UI , and
view objects in environment buckets, grant the
Environment User and Storage Object Viewer
( composer.environmentAndStorageObjectViewer ) role.
View environments
For a user that can view environments, view and trigger DAGs from
the DAG UI and access the Airflow web interface, grant
the Composer User ( composer.user ) role.

Basic roles
Note: Basic roles of Owner , Editor , and Viewer include
permissions for other Google Cloud services. If you grant one of these
roles to a principal, then you also provide extra permissions for
other Google Cloud services.
Basic roles work with Cloud Composer in the following way:
Owner ( owner ): allows full control of
Cloud Composer resources.
Editor ( editor ): allows full control of
Cloud Composer resources.
Viewer ( viewer ): allows a user to list and get
Cloud Composer resources.
See IAM basic and predefined roles reference for more
information about basic roles and Cloud Composer permissions
included in them.
Permissions for API methods
The following table lists permissions that the caller must have to
call each API method in the Cloud Composer API or to perform tasks using
Google Cloud tools that use the API (such as Google Cloud console or
Google Cloud CLI).
You can create your own custom roles that include individual permissions. For
more information, see Creating a custom role .

Permissions for using gcloud CLI with environments
To use gcloud with Cloud Composer environments, you need the
following permissions:
composer.environments.get
container.clusters.get
container.clusters.list
container.clusters.getCredentials
If you want to manage environments or environment buckets with
gcloud composer commands, you also must have a role that has
enough permissions to do so.
If you want to run Airflow CLI commands, you need the following, additional
permissions:
container.namespaces.list
container.pods.get
container.pods.list
(Cloud Composer 2.4.0 and later)
composer.environments.executeAirflowCommand
(Cloud Composer versions earlier than 2.4.0)
container.pods.exec
Permissions for working with DAGs from Google Cloud console
The following permissions cover working with DAGs from Google Cloud console,
through the DAG UI :
Permission
Description
composer.dags.list
View the list of DAGs on
the Environment details page.
composer.dags.get
Get detailed information about DAGs, DAG runs, and
tasks on the DAG details page.
composer.dags.getSourceCode
Get source code of DAGs on the DAG details page.
composer.dags.execute
Pause, unpause and trigger DAGs from the DAG details page.
Important: These permissions only affect Google Cloud console.
You can use Airflow UI Access Control to
further control DAG permissions for user accounts. DAG UI requires both
IAM and Airflow UI Access Control permissions to allow a
specific action on a DAG. At the same time, Airflow UI validates user access
only against Airflow UI Access Control permissions, skipping
IAM permissions.
For example, if a user has the composer.dags.execute permission and the
Viewer Airflow role, then this user cannot trigger DAGs from
Google Cloud console. As an opposite example, if a user does not have
the composer.dags.list permission, this user can still view the list of DAGs
in the Airflow UI .
Permissions and roles for Shared VPC networking
Shared VPC networking requires additional roles and permissions for service
accounts in service and host projects. For more information about configuring
these roles and permissions, see
Configuring Shared VPC networking .
Using a service account from another project
If you want a Cloud Composer environment in one project to use
a user-managed service account from a different project,
then configure the user-managed service account in the following way:
Make sure that the org policy of the project where your user-managed
service account is located
permits service account impersonation across projects .
Enable the Composer API
in the project where your user-managed service account is located. For
more information about why it's needed, see
Where to create service accounts .
Assign IAM roles as described in the following table.
Create your environment with a cross-project service account.
You can use Google Cloud CLI, API or Terraform. In Google Cloud console,
it is not possible to select a service account from a different project.
Note: SERVICE_PROJECT_NUMBER is the
project number of
a project where you create your Cloud Composer environment.
The following table describes the required IAM roles and
principals for your user-managed service account.
Project
Resource
Principal

Project
Your user-managed service account
Grant the required roles to your user-managed service account, as described in Grant roles to a user-managed service account . For example, in a Public IP configuration, your user-managed service account requires the Composer Worker role.
Allow access to Airflow UI
The following sections describe how to enable access to Airflow UI in various
scenarios.
Allow access to Airflow UI in Google Workspace
If the API Controls > Unconfigured third-party apps
> Don't allow users to access any third-party apps option is
enabled in Google Workspace and the Apache Airflow in
Cloud Composer app is not explicitly allowed, users are not able to
access the Airflow UI unless they explicitly allow the application.
To allow access to the Apache Airflow in Cloud Composer app, do the
following:
In Admin console, go to Menu
( menu ) >
Security > Access and data control >
API Controls .
Click Manage Third-Party App Access to view your configured apps.
Click Configure new app .
Search for the app's OAuth Client ID:
431403837536-q0odo3nmtfjocv7q291cnmedr0hnlbkh.apps.googleusercontent.com
Select the Apache Airflow in Cloud Composer app.
Select the scope of users to configure access for and click Continue .
In the Access to Google data , select Limited and click Continue .
Review the information and click Finish .
For more information about configuring third-party app access, see
Control which third-party and internal apps access Google Workspace data .
Allow access to Airflow UI in Context-Aware Access bindings
If Chrome Enterprise Premium Context-Aware Access bindings are used with
access levels that rely on device attributes, and the Apache Airflow in
Cloud Composer app is not exempted, then it's not possible to access
the Airflow UI because of a login loop.
To allow access, add an exemption for the Apache Airflow in
Cloud Composer app, as described in the following steps. Adding the
exemption relaxes the original restriction. However, access from devices that
don't match the original access level condition is still expected to be blocked
when authenticating to Airflow UI. If the previously allowed access is cached
in the web browser, it must expire before the access can be blocked.
For more information about applying different access levels in
Context-Aware Access bindings, see
Define configurations for specific applications .
To allow access to the Apache Airflow in Cloud Composer app:
In Access Context Manager, create a custom access level
that is equivalent to the access level currently bound in the
Context-Aware Access settings, but with removed conditions that rely on
device attributes. If the original access level had no conditions besides
device attributes, create a custom access level with a CEL expression set to
true .
Create an empty file named binding.yaml on your local computer. In later
steps, you will use it to update the existing binding that relies on device
attributes.
Find the existing access binding that uses the access level that relies on
device attributes.
You can list all bindings with the following command in Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud access-context-manager cloud-bindings list \
--organization ORGANIZATION_ID
Replace the following:
ORGANIZATION_ID :
Organization resource ID of the
organization where access bindings are defined for your users.
Copy the entire scopedAccessSettings section from the binding that relies
on device attributes to the binding.yaml file.
Warning: If you don't preserve the existing scopedAccessSettings section
in this step, then your existing binding's configuration can be lost
when you overwrite it in later steps with the updated configuration.
If the binding doesn't have this section, paste an empty section to this
file:
scopedAccessSettings :
Append the following list item to the binding.yaml file. It exempts the
Apache Airflow in Cloud Composer OAuth client from device
attributes checks:
- scope :
clientScope :
restrictedClientApplication :
clientId : 431403837536-q0odo3nmtfjocv7q291cnmedr0hnlbkh.apps.googleusercontent.com
activeSettings :
accessLevels :
- ACCESS_LEVEL_WITHOUT_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES
Replace the following:
ACCESS_LEVEL_WITHOUT_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES : the fully qualified name of the
custom access level that you created earlier, in the format:
accessPolicies/POLICY_ID/accessLevels/ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME .
Update the binding that relies on device attributes using the binding.yaml file.
gcloud access-context-manager cloud-bindings update \
--binding = BINDING_ID \
--binding-file = 'binding.yaml'
Replace the following:
BINDING_ID : fully qualified identifier of the access binding
that uses the access level that relies on device attributes. Use the
following format:
organizations/ORGANIZATION/gcpUserAccessBindings/BINDING_NAME .
Allow access to Airflow UI in VPC Service Controls ingress rules
If ingress rules are configured in a
VPC Service Controls perimeter that protects the project, and the ingress rule that
allows access to the Cloud Composer service uses
ANY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT or ANY_USER_ACCOUNT identity type, then users can't
access the Airflow UI, ending up in a login loop.
It isn't possible to use ingress rules with these identity types for the
Cloud Composer service and retain access to the Airflow UI. To
unblock access to the Airflow UI, you must either change the ingress rule to
use the ANY_IDENTITY identity type or a list of specific identities and
groups. As an alternative, you can configure an
access level that allows additional access to the
perimeter.
For a full list of features that aren't supported for ingress rules, see
Unsupported features .
