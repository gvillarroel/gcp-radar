This page explains how to configure authorized networks for your environment.
About authorized networks in Cloud Composer
Authorized networks allow you to specify
CIDR ranges that can access your environment's cluster control plane using
HTTPS.
For example, in Cloud Composer 1, such access to your environment's cluster
is required in Private IP environments to
run Airflow CLI commands ( gcloud composer environments run ).
Networks from where such requests are originated must be authorized to access
the control plane of your environment's cluster.
Authorized networks in Private and Public IP environments
You can specify authorized networks both for Public IP and
Private IP environments.
In Private IP environments you can configure authorized networks to allow a
certain range of IP addresses to access the control plane of your
environment's cluster. For example, to allow certain IP ranges to
run kubectl and Airflow CLI commands. By
default, in Private IP environments you can run these commands only from a
VM in the VPC subnetwork of the Private IP environment.
In Public IP environments, you can configure authorized networks to restrict
the range of IP addresses that can access the control plane of your
environment's cluster. By default, in Public IP environments there are no
restrictions on IP ranges that can run kubectl
and Airflow CLI commands.
Before you begin
You can specify authorized networks only using gcloud , Terraform, and
REST API.
You can specify authorized networks when you
create an environment , or
for an existing environment .
Create environments with authorized networks
gcloud
To create an environment with authorized networks, use the
--enable-master-authorized-networks argument when you create an
environment. Then provide a comma-separated list of CIDR ranges in
the --master-authorized-networks argument.
To specify authorized networks for a Private IP environment:
gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--enable-ip-alias \
--enable-private-environment \
--enable-master-authorized-networks \
--master-authorized-networks AUTHORIZED_NETWORKS_IP_RANGES
Replace:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME with the name of the environment.
LOCATION with the region where the environment is
located.
AUTHORIZED_NETWORKS_IP_RANGES with a comma-separated list of IP address
ranges in the CIDR notation. These ranges are added as authorized
networks for your environment's cluster.
Example (Private IP environment):
gcloud composer environments create example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \
--enable-ip-alias \
--enable-private-environment \
--enable-privately-used-public-ips \
--enable-master-authorized-networks \
--master-authorized-networks 192 .0.2.0/23,192.0.4.0/23
API
Construct
an environments.create API request. In
the Environment resource, specify the
configuration parameters for an environment with authorized networks.
To specify authorized networks for a Private IP environment:
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : " ENVIRONMENT_NAME " ,
"config" : {
"nodeConfig" : {
"ipAllocationPolicy" : {
"useIpAliases" : true ,
}
},
"privateEnvironmentConfig" : {
"enablePrivateEnvironment" : true ,
},
"masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig" : {
"enabled" : true ,
"cidrBlocks" : [
{
"displayName" : " AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_NAME " ,
"cidrBlock" : " AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_RANGE "
}
]
}
}
}
Replace:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME with the name of the environment.
AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_NAME with the name for the authorized network IP
range. You use this name to identify this block. This field is optional.
AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_RANGE with an IP address
range in the CIDR notation. This range is added as an authorized
networks for your environment's cluster.
If you want to use several IP ranges, add extra ranges to cidrBlocks .
Example (Private IP environment):
// POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/*/locations/*}/environments
{
"name" : "example-environment" ,
"config" : {
"nodeConfig" : {
"ipAllocationPolicy" : {
"useIpAliases" : true ,
}
},
"privateEnvironmentConfig" : {
"enablePrivateEnvironment" : true ,
},
"masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig" : {
"enabled" : true ,
"cidrBlocks" : [
{
"displayName" : "example_range_1" ,
"cidrBlock" : "192.0.2.0/23"
},
{
"displayName" : "example_range_2" ,
"cidrBlock" : "192.0.4.0/23"
}
]
}
}
}
Terraform
When you create an environment, the master_authorized_networks_config
block in the config block controls authorized networks for your
environment.
To specify authorized networks for a Private IP environment:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example_environment" {
provider = google-beta
name = " ENVIRONMENT_NAME "
region = " LOCATION "
config {
node_config {
ip_allocation_policy = [{
use_ip_aliases = true
}]
}
private_environment_config {
// Private environment parameters
}
master_authorized_networks_config {
enabled = true
cidr_blocks {
cidr_block = " AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_RANGE "
display_name = " AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_NAME "
}
}
}
}
Replace:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME with the name of the environment.
LOCATION with the region where the environment is
located.
AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_RANGE with an IP address
range in the CIDR notation. This range is added as an authorized
networks for your environment's cluster.
AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_NAME with the name for the authorized network IP
range. You use this name to identify this block.
If you want to use several IP ranges, add extra cidr_blocks blocks to
to master_authorized_networks_config .
Example (Private IP environment):
resource "google_composer_environment" "example_environment" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
node_config {
// Specify your network and subnetwork
network = google_compute_network.example_network.id
subnetwork = google_compute_subnetwork.example_subnet.id
ip_allocation_policy = [{
use_ip_aliases = true
}]
}
private_environment_config {
// Private environment parameters
}
master_authorized_networks_config {
enabled = true
cidr_blocks {
cidr_block = "192.0.2.0/23"
display_name = "example_range_1"
}
cidr_blocks {
cidr_block = "192.0.4.0/23"
display_name = "example_range_2"
}
}
}
}

You can specify authorized networks for an existing environment.
gcloud
To specify authorized networks, use the --enable-master-authorized-networks
argument. Then provide a comma-separated list of CIDR ranges in
the --master-authorized-networks argument.
gcloud composer environments update ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--enable-master-authorized-networks \
--master-authorized-networks AUTHORIZED_NETWORKS_IP_RANGES
Replace:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME with the name of the environment.

--enable-master-authorized-networks \
--master-authorized-networks 192 .0.2.0/23,192.0.4.0/23
API
Construct an environments.patch API request.
In this request:
In the updateMask parameter, specify
the config.softwareConfig.masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig mask.
In the request body, specify CIDR ranges for authorized networks.
"config" : {
"masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig" : {
"enabled" : true ,
"cidrBlocks" : [
{
"displayName" : " AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_NAME " ,
"cidrBlock" : " AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_RANGE "

}
Replace:
AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_NAME with the name for the authorized network IP
range. You use this name to identify this block. This field is optional.
AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_RANGE with an IP address
range in the CIDR notation. This range is added as an authorized
network for your environment's cluster.
If you want to use several IP ranges, add extra ranges to cidrBlocks .
Example:
// PATCH https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/example-project/
// locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment?updateMask=
// config.softwareConfig.masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig
"config" : {
"masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig" : {
"enabled" : true ,
"cidrBlocks" : [
{
"displayName" : "example_range_1" ,
"cidrBlock" : "192.0.2.0/23"
},
{
"displayName" : "example_range_2" ,
"cidrBlock" : "192.0.4.0/23"
}
]
}
}
Terraform
The master_authorized_networks_config block in the config block controls
authorized networks for your environment.
To add authorized networks for a Private IP environment, add this block to
your environment definition:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example_environment" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example_environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
// Other environment parameters
master_authorized_networks_config {
enabled = true
cidr_blocks {
cidr_block = " AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_RANGE "
display_name = " AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_NAME "
}
}
}
}
Replace:
AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_RANGE with an IP address
range in the CIDR notation. This range is added as an authorized
networks for your environment's cluster.
AUTHORIZED_NETWORK_NAME with the name for the authorized network IP
range. You use this name to identify this block.
If you want to use several IP ranges, add extra cidr_blocks blocks to
to master_authorized_networks_config .
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example_environment" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example-environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
// Other environment parameters
master_authorized_networks_config {
enabled = true
cidr_blocks {
cidr_block = "192.0.2.0/23"
display_name = "example_range_1"
}
cidr_blocks {
cidr_block = "192.0.4.0/23"
display_name = "example_range_2"
}
}
}
}
Disable authorized networks
You can disable authorized networks for an existing environment:
For Private IP environments, this removes access for ranges that were
previously added as authorized network.
For Public IP environments, this removes previously configured restrictions.
gcloud
To disable authorized networks, use the --disable-master-authorized-networks
argument.
gcloud composer environments update ENVIRONMENT_NAME \
--location LOCATION \
--disable-master-authorized-networks
Replace:
ENVIRONMENT_NAME with the name of the environment.
LOCATION with the region where the environment is
located.
Example:
gcloud composer environments update example-environment \
--location us-central1 \
--disable-master-authorized-networks
API
Construct an environments.patch API request.
In this request:
In the updateMask parameter, specify
the config.softwareConfig.masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig mask.
In the request body, specify false in the enabled field.
"config" : {
"masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig" : {
"enabled" : false
}
}
Example:
// PATCH https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/example-project/
// locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment?updateMask=
// config.softwareConfig.masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig
"config" : {
"masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig" : {
"enabled" : false ,
}
}
Terraform
The master_authorized_networks_config block in the config block controls
authorized networks for your environment.
To disable authorized networks, set the enabled field in
the master_authorized_networks_config block to false .
Example:
resource "google_composer_environment" "example_environment" {
provider = google-beta
name = "example_environment"
region = "us-central1"
config {
// Other environment parameters
master_authorized_networks_config {
enabled = false
}
}
}
