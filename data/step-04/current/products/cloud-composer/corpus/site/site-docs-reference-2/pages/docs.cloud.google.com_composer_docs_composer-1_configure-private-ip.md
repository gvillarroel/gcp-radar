This page provides information about configuring your Google Cloud
project networking for Private IP environments.
For Private IP environments, Cloud Composer assigns only private IP
( RFC 1918 ) addresses to the managed Google Kubernetes Engine and
Cloud SQL VMs in your environment.
As an option, you can also use privately used public IP addresses
and the IP Masquerade agent to save the IP address
space and to use non-RFC 1918 addresses.
For information about connecting to resources in your environment, see
Private IP .
Before you begin
Make sure that you have the appropriate user and service account
permissions to create an environment.
Check that
Incompatible organization policies
are not defined in your project.
Check network requirements
Verify that your project's VPC network meets the following
requirements:
Make sure that there are no private IP block conflicts. If your
VPC network and its established VPC
peers have overlapping IP blocks with the VPC
network in the Google-managed tenant project ,
Cloud Composer cannot create your environment.
See the default IP ranges table for the defaults used in
each region.
Make sure that there are sufficient secondary IP ranges for
the Cloud Composer GKE pods and services.
GKE searches for secondary IP ranges for IP Aliasing. If
GKE cannot find a range, Cloud Composer cannot
create your environment.
Make sure that the number of secondary ranges in your subnetwork does not
exceed 30. Consider the following:
The GKE cluster for your Private IP environment creates
two secondary ranges in the subnetwork. You can create multiple
subnetworks in the same region for the same VPC
network.
The maximum number of supported secondary ranges is 30. Each
Private IP environment requires two secondary ranges for
the Cloud Composer GKE pods and services.
Make sure that your project's network can accommodate the limit
on the maximum number of connections to a single VPC network .
The maximum number of Private IP environments you
can create depends on the number of already existing VPC
peering connections in your VPC network.
Each Private IP environment uses at most two VPC peerings per
environment. Cloud Composer creates one VPC peering for the
tenant project network. The second peering is created by the
GKE cluster of your environment, and
GKE clusters can reuse this connection .
Choose a network, subnetwork, and network ranges
Choose the network ranges for your Private IP environment (or use
the default ones ). You use these network ranges later when you
create a Private IP environment.
To create a Private IP environment, you need to have the following information:
Your VPC network ID
Your VPC subnetwork ID
Two secondary IP ranges in your VPC subnetwork:
Secondary IP range for pods
Secondary IP range for services
IP ranges for the components of the environment:
GKE Control Plane IP range . IP range for
the GKE control plane.
Web server IP range.
Web server IP range . IP range for the Airflow web server instance.
Cloud SQL IP range . IP range for the Cloud SQL
instance.
Caution: The 172.17.0.0/16 range is reserved in Cloud SQL .
See the default IP ranges table for the defaults used in each
region.

(Optional) Configure connectivity to Google APIs and services
As an option, you might want to route all traffic to Google APIs and services
through several IP addresses that belong to the private.googleapis.com
domain. In this configuration, your environment accesses Google APIs and
services through IP addresses only routable from within Google Cloud.
If your Private IP environment also uses VPC Service Controls, use
instructions for environments with VPC Service Controls
instead.
Cloud Composer environments use the following domains:
*.googleapis.com is used to access other Google services.
*.pkg.dev is used to get environment images, such as when creating or
updating an environment.
*.gcr.io GKE requires connectivity to
Container Registry domain regardless of Cloud Composer version.
Note: If you do not configure DNS rules for Google APIs and services,
they are resolved using the
domain option for default domains.
Configure connectivity to the private.googleapis.com endpoint:
Domain
DNS name
CNAME Record
A Record
*.googleapis.com
googleapis.com.
DNS Name: *.googleapis.com.
Resource record type: CNAME
Canonical name: googleapis.com.
Resource record type: A
IPv4 addresses: 199.36.153.8 , 199.36.153.9 , 199.36.153.10 , 199.36.153.11
*.pkg.dev
pkg.dev.
DNS Name: *.pkg.dev.
Resource record type: CNAME
Canonical name: pkg.dev.
Resource record type: A
IPv4 addresses: 199.36.153.8 , 199.36.153.9 , 199.36.153.10 , 199.36.153.11
*.gcr.io
gcr.io.
DNS Name: *.gcr.io.
Resource record type: CNAME
Canonical name: gcr.io.
Resource record type: A
IPv4 addresses: 199.36.153.8 , 199.36.153.9 , 199.36.153.10 , 199.36.153.11
To create a DNS rule:
Create a new DNS zone and use DNS name as DNS name
of this zone.
Example: pkg.dev.
Add a record set for CNAME Record .
Example:
DNS Name: *.pkg.dev.
Resource record type: CNAME
Canonical name: pkg.dev.
Add a record set with for A Record :
Example:
Resource record type: A
IPv4 addresses: 199.36.153.8 , 199.36.153.9 , 199.36.153.10 , 199.36.153.11
For more information, see
Setting up private connectivity to Google APIs and services .
(Optional) Configure firewall rules
Perform this step only if your project has non-default firewall rules, such as
rules that override
implied firewall rules , or
modify pre-populated rules in
the default network.
For example, Cloud Composer might fail to create an environment if
you have a firewall rule that denies all egress traffic. To avoid issues,
define selective allow rules that follow the list and have higher priority
than the global deny rule.
Important: Depending on how firewall rules are configured in your project, the
following list of rules might be redundant. For example, if your firewall rules
block only ingress, then you do not need the listed egress rules.
Configure your VPC network to allow traffic from your environment:
See Using firewall rules to learn how to
check, add and update rules for your VPC network.
Use
Connectivity Tool
to validate the connectivity between IP ranges.
You can use networking tags to further
limit access. You can set these tags when you create an environment.

Caution: GKE service automatically creates a number of ingress
and egress firewall rules so that your environment's cluster functions
correctly (such as ingress and egress rules for Google Cloud Health
Checks). See
GKE Firewall Rules
page for more information and don't delete or block firewall rules created by
GKE services. You might see that your environment communicates
with the 34.126.0.0/18 IP range, which is an IP range of
Private Google Access. This traffic belongs to GKE
service used by the environment's cluster.
To obtain environment cluster's IP ranges:
Pod, Service, and Control Plane address ranges are available on
the Clusters page of your environment's cluster:
In Google Cloud console, go to the Environments page.
Go to Environments
In the list of environments, click the name of your environment.
The Environment details page opens.
Go to the Environment configuration tab.
Follow the view cluster details link.
You can see environment's
web server IP range on the Environment configuration tab.
You can see environment's
network ID on the Environment configuration tab. To get IP
ranges for a subnetwork, go to VPC Networks page and click on the
network's name to see details:
Go to VPC Networks
VPC-native cluster configuration
Cloud Composer supports
VPC-native GKE clusters in your environment.
During environment creation ,
you can enable VPC Native (using alias IP) and configure
networking, such as IP allocation, without enabling private IP .
Because a VPC native cluster is required for Airflow tasks to communicate with
other VMs that are reachable through private IPs, you must also
enable VPC Native to configure a private IP environment.
Configure proxy server variables
Important: Routing with proxy variables is done on a best-effort basis.
There's no guarantee that every request goes through the proxy . Instead, we
recommend to route traffic by
creating your environment in a VPC network
and configuring traffic routing rules in this network.
You can set http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables
in your environment. These standard Linux variables are used by web clients
that run in containers of your environment's cluster to route traffic through
the specified proxies.
The NO_PROXY variable by default is set to a list of Google domains,
the IP address of the environment's cluster Compute Engine metadata
server, and localhost so that they are excluded from proxying:
.google.com,.googleapis.com,metadata.google.internal,169.254.169.254,localhost
This configuration makes it possible to create an environment with set
http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables in cases when the proxy
isn't configured to handle traffic to Google services.
