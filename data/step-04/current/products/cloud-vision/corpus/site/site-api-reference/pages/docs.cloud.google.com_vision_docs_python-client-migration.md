Migrating to Python Client Library v0.25.1
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Client Library for Python v0.25.1 includes some significant changes to how previous client libraries were designed. These changes can be summarized as follows:
Consolidation of modules into fewer types
Replacing untyped parameters with strongly-typed classes and enumerations
This topic provides details on the changes that you will need to make to your Python code for the Cloud Vision API client libraries in order to use the v0.25.1 Python client library.
Note:
Upcoming functionality of the API will only be supported in the v.0.25.1 and newer versions of the client library.
Running previous versions of the client library
You are not required to upgrade your Python client library to v0.25.1. If you want to continue using a previous version of the Python client library
and do not want to migrate your code, then you should specify the version of
the Python client library used by your app. To specify a specific library
version, edit the requirements.txt file as shown:
google - cloud - vision == 0.25
Removed Modules
The following modules were removed in the Python Client Library v0.25.1 package.
google.cloud.vision.annotations
google.cloud.vision.batch
google.cloud.vision.client
google.cloud.vision.color
google.cloud.vision.crop_hint
google.cloud.vision.entity
google.cloud.vision.face
google.cloud.vision.feature
google.cloud.vision.geometry
google.cloud.vision.image
google.cloud.vision.likelihood
google.cloud.vision.safe_search
google.cloud.vision.text
google.cloud.vision.web
Required Code Changes
Imports
Include the new google.cloud.vision.types module in order to access the new types in the Python Client Library v0.25.1.
The types module contains the new classes that are required for creating requests, such as types.Image .
from google.cloud import vision
Additionally, the new google.cloud.vision.enums module contains the enumerations useful for parsing and understanding API responses, such as enums.Likelihood.UNLIKELY and enums.FaceAnnotation.Landmark.Type.LEFT_EYE .
Create a client
The Client class has been replaced with the ImageAnnotatorClient class. Replace references to the Client class with ImageAnnotatorClient .
Previous versions of the client libraries:
old_client = vision . Client ()
Python Client Library v0.25.1:
client = vision . ImageAnnotatorClient ()
Constructing objects that represent image content
To identify image content from a local file, from a Google Cloud Storage URI, or from a web URI, use the new Image class.
Constructing objects that represent image content from a local file
The following example shows the new way to represent image content from a local file.
Previous versions of the client libraries:
with io . open ( file_name , 'rb' ) as image_file :
content = image_file . read ()
image = old_client . image ( content = content )
Python Client Library v0.25.1:
with open ( path , "rb" ) as image_file :
content = image_file . read ()
image = vision . Image ( content = content )
Constructing objects that represent image content from a URI
The following example shows the new way to represent image content from a Google Cloud Storage URI or a web URI. uri is the URI to an image file on Google Cloud Storage or on the web.
Previous versions of the client libraries:
image = old_client . image ( source_uri = uri )
Python Client Library v0.25.1:
image = vision . Image ()
image . source . image_uri = uri
Making requests and processing responses
With the Python Client Library v.0.25.1 the API methods such as face_detection belong to the ImageAnnotatorClient object as opposed to the Image objects.
The returned values are different for several methods as explained below.
Particularly, bounding box vertices are now stored in bounding_poly.vertices as opposed to bounds.vertices . The coordinates of each vertex are stored in vertex.x and vertex.y as opposed to vertex.x_coordinate and vertex.y_coordinate .
The bounding box change affects face_detection , logo_detection , text_detection , document_text_detection , and crop_hints .
Making a face detection request and processing the response
Emotion likelihoods are now returned as enumerations stored in face.surprise_likelihood as opposed to face.emotions.surprise . The names of likelihood labels can be recovered by importing google.cloud.vision.enums.Likelihood .
Previous versions of the client libraries: :
with io . open ( file_name , 'rb' ) as image_file :

Python Client Library v0.25.1:

image = old_client . image ( content = content )
landmarks = image . detect_landmarks ()

and an ImageContext .
