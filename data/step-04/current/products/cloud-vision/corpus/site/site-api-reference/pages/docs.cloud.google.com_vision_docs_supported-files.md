Supported image formats and dimensions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
There are specific image formats, image dimensions, and file sizes you can send
to Cloud Vision. Use this guidance to ensure effective feature detection
when using the Vision API.
File formats
The Vision API supports the following image types:
JPEG
PNG8
PNG24
GIF
Animated GIF (first frame only)
BMP
WEBP
RAW
ICO
PDF
TIFF
Some of these image formats are
lossy (for example, JPEG).
Reducing file sizes for such lossy formats might degrade image quality and
Vision API accuracy.
Image dimension recommendations
For accurate image detection within the Vision API, use images that are a
minimum of 640x480 pixels (about 300,000 pixels).
In practice, a standard size of 640x480 pixels works well in most cases. Image
sizes larger than 640x480 pixels may not gain much in accuracy, while greatly
diminishing throughput. When possible, pre-process your images to reduce their
size to these minimum standards.
The following recommended sizes vary by the feature detected. For example,
FACE_DETECTION requests generally require larger image sizes because the
detected features (faces) are smaller than the image. LABEL_DETECTION
requests, on the other hand, generally evaluate an entire image.
The following table lists types of Vision API feature requests and
their recommended image sizes:
Vision API feature
Recommended size
Notes
FACE_DETECTION
1600x1200
Distance between eyes is the most important.
LANDMARK_DETECTION
640x480
-
LOGO_DETECTION
640x480
-
LABEL_DETECTION
640x480
-
TEXT_DETECTION and DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION
1024x768
OCR requires more resolution to detect characters.
SAFE_SEARCH_DETECTION
640x480
-
Vision API requires images large enough to distinguish important features.
Sizes smaller or larger than these recommended sizes can work. However, smaller
sizes can result in lower accuracy, and larger sizes can increase processing
time and bandwidth usage without a proportional accuracy gain. For OCR analysis,
image size must not exceed 75,000,000 pixels (length x width). If an image
exceeds this limit, the Vision API resizes it; otherwise, the Vision API
uses the original image.
Image and file size
Image files sent to the Vision API shouldn't exceed 20 MB. Files
exceeding 20 MB generate an error. The Vision API doesn't resize files
of this size.
To improve query latency, reduce your file size. However, avoid reducing image
quality during this process.
The Vision API imposes a 10 MB JSON request size limit. Host larger
files on Cloud Storage or on the web, rather than passing them as base64-encoded
content in the JSON itself.
