Detect handwriting in images
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note:
Using this API in a mobile device app? Try
Firebase Machine Learning and
ML Kit ,
which provide platform-specific Android and iOS SDKs for using Cloud Vision services, as well as
on-device ML Vision APIs and on-device inference using custom ML models.
The Vision API now supports offline asynchronous batch image
annotation for all features. This asynchronous request supports up
to 2000 image files and returns response JSON files that are stored in
your Cloud Storage bucket. For more information about this
feature, refer to Offline batch image
annotation .
Pricing for document text detection is at the
DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION rate. Please see the
Pricing page for details.
Handwriting detection with Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
The Vision API can detect and extract text from images:
DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION extracts text from an image (or
file ); the response
is optimized for dense text and documents . The JSON includes page, block,
paragraph, word, and break information.
One specific use of DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION is to detect
handwriting in an image.

Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init

Detect document text in a local image
You can use the Vision API to perform feature detection on a local image file.
For REST requests, send the contents of the image file as a
base64 encoded string in the body of your request.
For gcloud and client library requests, specify the path to a local image in your
request.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE : The base64
representation (ASCII string) of your binary image data. This string should look similar to the
following string:
/9j/4QAYRXhpZgAA...9tAVx/zDQDlGxn//2Q==
Visit the base64 encode topic for more information.
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate
Request JSON body:
{
"requests": [
{
"image": {
"content": " BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE "
},
"features": [
{
"type": "DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION"
}
]
}
]
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate" | Select-Object -Expand Content
If the request is successful, the server returns a 200 OK HTTP status code and
the response in JSON format.
Note: Zero coordinate values omitted. When the API detects
a coordinate ("x" or "y") value of 0, that coordinate is omitted in the
JSON response . Thus, a response with a bounding poly around the entire image
would be [{},{"x": 100},{"x": 100,"y": 100},{"y": 100}] for an image that is 100 pixels by 100 pixels . For more information, see the
API Reference documentation .

Detect document text in a remote image
You can use the Vision API to perform feature detection on a remote image file that is located
in Cloud Storage or on the Web. To send a remote file request, specify the file's Web URL or
Cloud Storage URI in the request body.
Caution: When fetching images from HTTP/HTTPS
URLs, Google cannot guarantee that the
request will be completed. Your request might fail if the specified host
denies the request (for example, due to request throttling or
DoS prevention), or if
Google throttles requests to the site for abuse prevention. As a best practice, don't
depend on externally-hosted images for production applications .
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
CLOUD_STORAGE_IMAGE_URI : the path to a valid
image file in a Cloud Storage bucket. You must at least have read privileges to the file.
Example:
gs://cloud-samples-data/vision/handwriting_image.png
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate
Request JSON body:
{
"requests": [
{
"image": {
"source": {
"imageUri": " CLOUD_STORAGE_IMAGE_URI "
}
},
"features": [
{
"type": "DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION"
}
]
}
]
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate" | Select-Object -Expand Content
If the request is successful, the server returns a 200 OK HTTP status code and
the response in JSON format.
Note: Zero coordinate values omitted. When the API detects
a coordinate ("x" or "y") value of 0, that coordinate is omitted in the
JSON response . Thus, a response with a bounding poly around the entire image
would be [{},{"x": 100},{"x": 100,"y": 100},{"y": 100}] for an image that is 100 pixels by 100 pixels . For more information, see the

gcloud
To perform handwriting detection, use the
gcloud ml vision detect-document
command as shown in the following example:
gcloud ml vision detect-document gs://cloud-samples-data/vision/handwriting_image.png
Additional languages
C# :
Please follow the
C# setup instructions
on the client libraries page
and then visit the
Vision reference documentation for .NET.
PHP :
Please follow the
PHP setup instructions
on the client libraries page
and then visit the
Vision reference documentation for PHP.
Ruby :
Please follow the
Ruby setup instructions
on the client libraries page
and then visit the
Vision reference documentation for Ruby.
Specify the language (optional)
Both types of OCR requests support one or more languageHints that specify the
language of any text in the image. However, an empty value usually yields the best results,
because omitting a value enables automatic language detection. For languages based on the Latin
alphabet, setting languageHints is not needed. In rare cases, when the language of
the text in
the image is known, setting a hint helps get better results (although it can be a significant
hindrance if the hint is wrong). Text detection returns an error if one or more of the specified
languages is not one of the
supported languages .
If you choose to provide a language hint, modify the body of your request
( request.json file) to provide the string of one of the supported languages
in the imageContext.languageHints field as shown in the following sample:
{
"requests" : [
{
"image" : {
"source" : {
"imageUri" : " IMAGE_URL "
}
} ,
"features" : [
{
"type" : "DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION"
}
] ,
"imageContext" : {
"languageHints" : [ "en-t-i0-handwrit" ]
}
}
]
}
How do language hints work?
The languageHint format follows the
BCP47 language code formatting guidelines.
The BCP47 specified format is as follows:
language ["-" script ] ["-" region ] *("-" variant ) *("-" extension ) ["-" privateuse ].
For example, the language hint
" en - t - i0 - handwrit "
specifies English language ( en ),
transform extension singleton
( t ), input method engine
transform extension code ( i0 ), and
handwriting
transform code
( handwrit ).
This code says that the language is "English transformed from handwriting." You don't need
to specify a script code because Latn is implied by the " en "
language.
Multi-regional support
This functionality currently only applies to the OCR feature
(types TEXT_DETECTION or DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION ).
You can now specify continent-level data storage and OCR processing. The following regions
are currently supported:
us : USA country only
eu : The European Union
Locations
Cloud Vision offers you some control over where the resources for your project
are stored and processed. In particular, you can configure
Cloud Vision to store and process your data only in the European Union.
By default Cloud Vision stores and processes resources in a Global location,
which means that Cloud Vision doesn't guarantee that your resources will remain
within a particular location or region. If you choose the European Union location,
Google will store your data and process it only in the European Union.
You and your users can access the data from any location.
Setting the location using the API
The Vision API supports a global API endpoint ( vision.googleapis.com ) and also
two region-based endpoints: a European Union endpoint
( eu-vision.googleapis.com ) and United States
endpoint ( us-vision.googleapis.com ). Use these endpoints for region-specific
processing. For example, to store and process your data in the European Union only, use the
URI eu-vision.googleapis.com in place of vision.googleapis.com
for your REST API calls:
https:// eu- vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ eu /images:annotate
https:// eu- vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ eu /images:asyncBatchAnnotate
https:// eu- vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ eu /files:annotate
https:// eu- vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ eu /files:asyncBatchAnnotate
To store and process your data in the United States only, use the US endpoint
( us-vision.googleapis.com ) with the preceding methods.
Setting the location using the client libraries
The Vision API client libraries accesses the global API endpoint
( vision.googleapis.com ) by default. To store and process your data in the
European Union only, you need to explicitly set the endpoint
( eu-vision.googleapis.com ). The following code samples show how to configure
this setting.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
REGION_ID : One of the valid regional
location identifiers:
us : USA country only
eu : The European Union
CLOUD_STORAGE_IMAGE_URI : the path to a valid
image file in a Cloud Storage bucket. You must at least have read privileges to the file.
Example:
gs://cloud-samples-data/vision/handwriting_image.png
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https:// REGION_ID -vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION_ID /images:annotate
Request JSON body:
{
"requests": [
{
"image": {
"source": {
"imageUri": " CLOUD_STORAGE_IMAGE_URI "
}
},
"features": [
{
"type": "DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION"
}
]
}
]
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https:// REGION_ID -vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION_ID /images:annotate"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https:// REGION_ID -vision.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION_ID /images:annotate" | Select-Object -Expand Content
If the request is successful, the server returns a 200 OK HTTP status code and
the response in JSON format.
Note: Zero coordinate values omitted. When the API detects
a coordinate ("x" or "y") value of 0, that coordinate is omitted in the
JSON response . Thus, a response with a bounding poly around the entire image
would be [{},{"x": 100},{"x": 100,"y": 100},{"y": 100}] for an image that is 100 pixels by 100 pixels . For more information, see the
API Reference documentation .
