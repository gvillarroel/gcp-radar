)
Manages Products and ProductSets of reference images for use in
product search. It uses the following resource model:
The API has a collection of
ProductSet resources, named
projects/*/locations/*/productSets/* , which acts as a way to
put different products into groups to limit identification.
In parallel,
The API has a collection of
Product resources, named
projects/*/locations/*/products/*
Each Product has a collection of
ReferenceImage resources,
named projects/*/locations/*/products/*/referenceImages/*
Properties
api_endpoint
Return the API endpoint used by the client instance.
Returns
Type
Description
str
The API endpoint used by the client instance.
transport

Returns
Type
Description

Methods
ProductSearchClient
ProductSearchClient (
* ,
credentials : typing . Optional [ google . auth . credentials . Credentials ] = None ,
transport : typing . Optional [
typing . Union [
str ,
google . cloud . vision_v1 . services . product_search . transports . base . ProductSearchTransport ,
typing . Callable [
[ ... ],
google . cloud . vision_v1 . services . product_search . transports . base . ProductSearchTransport ,
],
]
] = None ,
client_options : typing . Optional [
typing . Union [ google . api_core . client_options . ClientOptions , dict ]
] = None ,
client_info : google . api_core . gapic_v1 . client_info . ClientInfo = google . api_core . gapic_v1 . client_info . ClientInfo
)
Instantiates the product search client.
Parameters
Name
Description
credentials
Optional[google.auth.credentials.Credentials]
The authorization credentials to attach to requests. These credentials identify the application to the service; if none are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the credentials from the environment.
transport
Optional[Union[str,ProductSearchTransport,Callable[..., ProductSearchTransport]]]
The transport to use, or a Callable that constructs and returns a new transport. If a Callable is given, it will be called with the same set of initialization arguments as used in the ProductSearchTransport constructor. If set to None, a transport is chosen automatically.
client_options
Optional[Union[google.api_core.client_options.ClientOptions, dict]]
Custom options for the client. 1. The api_endpoint property can be used to override the default endpoint provided by the client when transport is not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and transport was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment variable, which have one of the following values: "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is the default value). 2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable is "true", then the client_cert_source property can be used to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not set, no client certificate will be used. 3. The universe_domain property can be used to override the default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that the api_endpoint property still takes precedence; and universe_domain is currently not supported for mTLS.
client_info
google.api_core.gapic_v1.client_info.ClientInfo
The client info used to send a user-agent string along with API requests. If None , then default info will be used. Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing your own client library.
Exceptions
Type
Description
google.auth.exceptions.MutualTLSChannelError
If mutual TLS transport creation failed for any reason.
__exit__
__exit__ ( type , value , traceback )
Releases underlying transport's resources.
Warning:
ONLY use as a context manager if the transport is NOT shared
with other clients! Exiting the with block will CLOSE the transport
and may cause errors in other clients!

It is recommended to not delete the specified ProductSet until
after this operation has completed. It is also recommended to
not add any of the Products involved in the batch delete to a
new ProductSet while this operation is running because those
Products may still end up deleted.
It's not possible to undo the PurgeProducts operation.
Therefore, it is recommended to keep the csv files used in
ImportProductSets (if that was how you originally built the
Product Set) before starting PurgeProducts, in case you need to
re-import the data after deletion.
If the plan is to purge all of the Products from a ProductSet
and then re-use the empty ProductSet to re-import new Products
into the empty ProductSet, you must wait until the PurgeProducts
operation has finished for that ProductSet.
The google.longrunning.Operation][google.longrunning.Operation]
API can be used to keep track of the progress and results of the
request. Operation.metadata contains
BatchOperationMetadata . (progress)

Parameters
Name
Description
request
Union[ google.cloud.vision_v1.types.PurgeProductsRequest , dict]
The request object. Request message for the PurgeProducts method.
parent
str
Required. The project and location in which the Products should be deleted. Format is projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID . This corresponds to the parent field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set.
retry
google.api_core.retry.Retry
Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
timeout
float
The timeout for this request.
metadata
Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]
Key/value pairs which should be sent along with the request as metadata. Normally, each value must be of type str , but for metadata keys ending with the suffix -bin , the corresponding values must be of type bytes .
Returns
Type
Description
google.api_core.operation.Operation
An object representing a long-running operation. The result type for the operation will be google.protobuf.empty_pb2.Empty A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
reference_image_path
reference_image_path (
project : str , location : str , product : str , reference_image : str
) - > str
Returns a fully-qualified reference_image string.

Makes changes to a Product resource. Only the display_name ,
description , and labels fields can be updated right now.
If labels are updated, the change will not be reflected in
queries until the next index time.
Possible errors:
Returns NOT_FOUND if the Product does not exist.
Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if display_name is present in
update_mask but is missing from the request or longer than
4096 characters.
Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if description is present in
