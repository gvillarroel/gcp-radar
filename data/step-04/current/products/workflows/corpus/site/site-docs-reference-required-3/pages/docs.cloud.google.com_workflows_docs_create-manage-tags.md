Create and manage tags
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide describes how to create and manage workflow tags in
Workflows. You can use tags to group workflows and other resources
across Google Cloud for reporting, auditing, and access control in your
Google Cloud organization.
About tags
A tag is a key-value pair that can attach to a resource within
Google Cloud. You can use tags to conditionally allow or deny policies based on
whether a resource has a specific tag. For example, you can conditionally grant
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles based on whether a resource has a specific tag.
For more information about tags, see Tags overview .
Tags are attached to resources by creating a tag binding resource that links the
value to the Google Cloud resource.
To group workflows within Workflows for
automation and billing purposes, use
labels . Tags and labels work
independently of each other, and you can apply both to the same workflow. For
more information on the differences between tags and labels see
Tags and labels .
Required permissions
To get the permissions that
you need to manage tags,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Tag Viewer ( roles/resourcemanager.tagViewer )
on the resources the tags are attached to
View and manage tags at the organization level:
Organization Viewer ( roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer )
on the organization
Create, update, and delete tag definitions:
Tag Administrator ( roles/resourcemanager.tagAdmin )
on the resource you're creating, updating, or deleting tags for
Attach and remove tags from resources:
Tag User ( roles/resourcemanager.tagUser )
on the tag value and the resources that you are attaching or removing the tag value to
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
To attach tags to Workflows
workflows, you need the
Workflows Editor
role ( roles/workflows.editor ).
Create tag keys and values
Before you can attach a tag, you need to create a tag and configure its value.
To create tag keys and tag values, see Creating a tag and
Adding a tag value .
Add tags to existing resources
To add a tag to existing workflows, follow these steps:
Console
Go to the Workflows page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to Workflows
Select the workflow for which you would like to
attach a tag.
Click
label_important Tags .
If your organization doesn't appear in the Tags panel, click
Select scope . Select your organization and click
Open .
Click Add tag .
Select the key for the tag you want to attach from the list. You can
filter the list by typing keywords.
Select the value for the tag you want to attach from the list. You
can filter the list by typing keywords.
Click Save .
In the Confirm dialog, click Confirm to attach the
tag.
A notification confirms that your tags updated.
gcloud
To attach a tag to a workflow, you must create a
tag binding resource by using the
gcloud resource-manager tags bindings create command:
gcloud resource-manager tags bindings create \
--tag-value= TAGVALUE_NAME \
--parent= RESOURCE_ID \
--location= LOCATION
Replace the following:
TAGVALUE_NAME : the permanent ID or
namespaced name of the tag value that is attached—for example,
tagValues/567890123456 .
RESOURCE_ID is the full ID of the resource,
including the API domain name to identify the type of resource
( //workflows.googleapis.com/ ). For
example, to attach a tag to the workflow myWorkflow in projects/workflows-test-project , in the region us-central1 , the full ID is:
//workflows.googleapis.com/projects/workflows-test-project/locations/us-central1/workflows/myWorkflow .
LOCATION : the
location of your resource. If you're attaching a tag to a global
resource, such as a folder or a project, omit this flag.
If you're attaching a tag to a regional or a zonal resource, you must
specify the location—for example,
us-central1 (region) or us-central1-a
(zone).
List tags attached to resources
You can view a list of tag bindings directly attached to or inherited by the
workflow.
Console
Go to the Workflows page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to Workflows
Tags are displayed in the Tags column of the workflow.
gcloud
To get a list of tag bindings attached to a resource, use the
gcloud resource-manager tags bindings list command:
gcloud resource-manager tags bindings list \
--parent= RESOURCE_ID \
--location= LOCATION
Replace the following:
RESOURCE_ID is the full ID of the resource,
including the API domain name to identify the type of resource
( //workflows.googleapis.com/ ). For
example, to attach a tag to the workflow myWorkflow in projects/workflows-test-project , in the region us-central1 , the full ID is:
//workflows.googleapis.com/projects/workflows-test-project/locations/us-central1/workflows/myWorkflow .
LOCATION : the
location of your resource. If you're viewing a tag attached to a
global resource, such as a folder or a project, omit this
flag. If you're viewing a tag attached to a regional or a zonal
resource, you must specify the location—for example,
us-central1 (region) or us-central1-a
(zone).
You should get a response similar to the following:
name: tagBindings/%2F%2Fcloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2F7890123456/tagValues/567890123456
tagValue: tagValues/567890123456
resource: //workflows.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION/WORKFLOW_ID
Detach tags from resources
You can detach tags that have been directly attached to
a workflow. Inherited tags can be overridden by attaching
a tag with the same key and a different value, but they can't be detached.
Console
Go to the Workflows page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to Workflows
Select the workflow from which you want to remove a
tag.
Click
label_important Tags .
In the Tags panel, next to the tag you want to detach, click
delete Delete item .
Click Save .
In the Confirm dialog, click Confirm to detach the
tag.
A notification confirms that your tags updated.
gcloud
To delete a tag binding, use the
gcloud resource-manager tags bindings delete command:
gcloud resource-manager tags bindings delete \
--tag-value= TAGVALUE_NAME \
--parent= RESOURCE_ID \
--location= LOCATION
Replace the following:
TAGVALUE_NAME : the permanent ID or
namespaced name of the tag value that is attached—for example,
tagValues/567890123456 .
RESOURCE_ID is the full ID of the resource,
including the API domain name to identify the type of resource
( //workflows.googleapis.com/ ). For
example, to attach a tag to the workflow myWorkflow in projects/workflows-test-project , in the region us-central1 , the full ID is:
//workflows.googleapis.com/projects/workflows-test-project/locations/us-central1/workflows/myWorkflow .
LOCATION : the
location of your resource. If you're attaching a tag to a global
resource, such as a folder or a project, omit this flag.
If you're attaching a tag to a regional or a zonal resource, you must
specify the location—for example,
us-central1 (region) or us-central1-a
(zone).
Delete tag keys and values
When removing a tag key or value definition, ensure that the tag is detached from the
workflow. You must delete existing tag attachments, called tag
bindings, before deleting the tag definition itself. To delete tag keys and tag
values, see Deleting tags .
Identity and Access Management conditions and tags
You can use tags and IAM conditions to conditionally
grant role bindings to users in your hierarchy. Changing or deleting the tag
attached to a resource can remove user access to that resource if an
IAM policy with conditional role bindings has been applied. For
more information, see Identity and Access Management conditions and tags .

IAM.
