Run a Batch job using Workflows
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Batch is a fully managed service that lets you
schedule, queue, and execute
batch processing
workloads on Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances.
Batch provisions resources and manages capacity on your
behalf, allowing your batch workloads to run at scale.
Workflows allows you to execute the services you
need in an order that you define described using the
Workflows syntax .
In this tutorial, you use the
Workflows connector for Batch
to schedule and run a Batch job that executes six tasks in
parallel on two Compute Engine VMs. Using both Batch
and Workflows allows you to combine the advantages they offer
and efficiently provision and orchestrate the entire process.
Objectives
In this tutorial you will:
Create an Artifact Registry repository for a Docker container image.
Get the code for the batch processing workload from GitHub: a sample program
that generates prime numbers in batches of 10,000.
Build the Docker image for the workload.
Deploy and execute a workflow that does the following:
Creates a Cloud Storage bucket to store the results of the prime
number generator.
Schedules and runs a Batch job that runs the Docker
container as six tasks in parallel on two Compute Engine VMs.
Optionally deletes the Batch job after it has completed.
Confirm that the results are as expected and that the batches of generated
prime numbers are stored in Cloud Storage.
You can run most of the following commands in the Google Cloud console, or run all
the commands using the Google Cloud CLI in either your terminal or Cloud Shell.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Artifact Registry
Batch
Cloud Build
Workflows
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
Before you begin
Security constraints defined by your organization might prevent you from completing the
following steps. For troubleshooting information, see
Develop applications in a constrained Google Cloud environment .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or
create a Google Cloud project .
Note: If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this
procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After
you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources
associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project. Learn how to
check if billing is enabled on a project .
Enable the Artifact Registry, Batch, Cloud Build,
Compute Engine, Workflow Executions, and Workflows APIs.
Enable the APIs
Create a service account for your workflow to use for authentication with
other Google Cloud services and grant it the appropriate roles:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create service account
page.
Go to Create service account
Select your project.
In the Service account name field, enter a name. The Google Cloud console
fills in the Service account ID field based on this name.
In the Service account description field, enter a description. For
example, Service account for tutorial .
Click Create and continue .
In the Select a role list, filter for the following roles to grant
to the user-managed service account you created in the previous step:
Batch job editor : to edit Batch jobs.
Logs Writer : to write logs.
Storage Admin : to control Cloud Storage resources.
For additional roles, click add
Add another role and add each additional role.
Note: The Role field affects which resources your service account
can access in your project. You can revoke these roles or grant
additional roles later. In production environments, do not grant the
Owner, Editor, or Viewer roles. Instead, grant a
predefined role or
custom role that meets your
needs.
Click Continue .
To finish creating the account, click Done .
Grant the IAM Service Account User role on the default
service account to the user-managed service account created in the previous
step. After you enabled the Compute Engine API, the default service account
is the Compute Engine default service account
( PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com ),
and the permission is typically assigned through the
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser role.
Caution: Assigning the
Service Account User role
indirectly grants the role associated with the default service account to
the user. For example, if the default service account has the Editor role,
the user can then "act as" an Editor. To minimize the impact of these role
assignments, we recommend configuring the default service account
according to
the principle of least privilege .
For more information, see
Disable automatic role grants to default service accounts .
On the Service Accounts page, click the email address of the
default service account
( PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com ).
Click the Permissions tab.
Click the person_add Grant
access button.
To add a new principal, enter the email address of your service account
( SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com ).
In the Select a role list, select the Service Accounts
> Service Account User role.
Click Save .
gcloud
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project.
Learn how to
check if billing is enabled on a project .
Enable the Artifact Registry, Batch, Cloud Build,
Compute Engine Workflow Executions, and Workflows APIs.
gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
batch.googleapis.com \
cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
compute.googleapis.com \
workflowexecutions.googleapis.com \
workflows.googleapis.com
Create a service account for your workflow to use for authentication with
other Google Cloud services and grant it the appropriate roles.
Create the service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts create SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME with a name for
the service account.
Grant roles to the user-managed service account you created in the
previous step. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/batch.jobsEditor : to edit Batch jobs.
roles/logging.logWriter : to write logs.
roles/storage.admin : to control Cloud Storage resources.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID where you created
the service account
ROLE : the role to grant
Note: The --role flag affects which resources your service account
can access in your project. You can revoke these roles or grant
additional roles later. In production environments, do not grant the
Owner, Editor, or Viewer roles. Instead, grant a
predefined role or
custom role that meets your
needs.
Grant the IAM Service Account User role on the default
service account to the user-managed service account you created in the
previous step. After you enabled the Compute Engine API, the default service
account is the Compute Engine default service account
( PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com ),
and the permission is typically assigned through the
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser role.
Caution: Assigning the
Service Account User role
indirectly grants the role associated with the default service account to
the user. For example, if the default service account has the Editor role,
the user can then "act as" an Editor. To minimize the impact of these role
assignments, we recommend configuring the default service account
according to
the principle of least privilege .
For more information, see
Disable automatic role grants to default service accounts .
PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects describe PROJECT_ID --format = 'value(projectNumber)' )
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
$PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
--member = serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
Create an Artifact Registry repository
Create a repository to store your Docker container image.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Repositories page.
Go to Repositories
Click add
Create Repository .
Enter containers as the repository name.
For Format , choose Docker .
For Location Type , choose Region .
In the Region list, select us-central1 .
Click Create .
gcloud
Run the following command:
gcloud artifacts repositories create containers \
--repository-format=docker \
--location=us-central1
You have created an Artifact Registry repository named containers in the
us-central1 region. For more information about supported regions, see
Artifact Registry locations .
Get the code samples
Google Cloud stores the application source code for this tutorial in
GitHub. You can clone that repository or download the samples.
Clone the sample app repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/batch-samples.git
Alternatively, you can
download the samples in the main.zip file
and extract it.
Change to the directory that contains the sample code:
cd batch-samples/primegen
You now have the source code for the application in your development environment.
Build the Docker image using Cloud Build
The Dockerfile contains the information needed to build a Docker image
using Cloud Build. Run the following command to build it:
gcloud builds submit \
-t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID /containers/primegen-service:v1 PrimeGenService/
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud
project ID.
When the build is complete, you should see output similar to the following:
DONE

STATUS: SUCCESS
Using a Dockerfile, you've built a Docker image named primegen-service and
pushed the image to an Artifact Registry repository named containers .
Deploy a workflow that schedules and runs a Batch job
The following workflow schedules and runs a Batch job that runs
a Docker container as six tasks in parallel on two Compute Engine VMs. The
result is the generation of six batches of prime numbers, stored in a
Cloud Storage bucket.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Workflows
page.
Go to Workflows
Click add

The workflow execution should take a few minutes.
Note: If you encounter an IAM permission denied for service account
error in the createBucket step, this is likely due to a propagation
delay . Wait a minute or two, and
then try executing the workflow again.
View the results of the workflow in the Output pane.
The results should look similar to the following:
{
"bucket": "project-name-job-primegen- TIMESTAMP ",
"jobId": "job-primegen- TIMESTAMP "
}
gcloud
Execute the workflow:
gcloud workflows run batch-workflow \
--location = us-central1
The workflow execution should take a few minutes.
Note: If you encounter an IAM permission denied for service account
error in the createBucket step, this is likely due to a propagation
delay . Wait a minute or two, and
then try executing the workflow again.
You can
check the status of a long running execution .
To get the status of the last completed execution, run the following
command:
gcloud workflows executions describe-last

gs://project-name-job-primegen- TIMESTAMP /primes-50001-60000.txt
Clean up
If you created a new project for this tutorial, delete the project .
If you used an existing project and wish to keep it without the changes added
in this tutorial, delete resources created for the tutorial .
Delete the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Delete resources created in this tutorial
Delete the Batch job:
First retrieve the job name:
gcloud batch jobs list --location = us-central1
The output should be similar to the following:
NAME: projects/project-name/locations/us-central1/jobs/ job-primegen- TIMESTAMP
STATE: SUCCEEDED
Where job-primegen- TIMESTAMP is the name of the Batch
job.
Delete the job:
gcloud batch jobs delete BATCH_JOB_NAME --location us-central1
Delete the workflow:
gcloud workflows delete WORKFLOW_NAME
Delete the container repository:
gcloud artifacts repositories delete REPOSITORY_NAME --location = us-central1
Cloud Build uses Cloud Storage to store build resources.
To delete a Cloud Storage bucket, refer to
Delete buckets .
