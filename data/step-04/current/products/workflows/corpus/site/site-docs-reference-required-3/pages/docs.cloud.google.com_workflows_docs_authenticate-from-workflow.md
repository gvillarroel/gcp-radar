Make authenticated requests from a workflow
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
To make authenticated HTTP requests, your workflow must be associated with a
service account (identified by its email address) that has the appropriate
credentials. For more information about attaching an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
service account to a workflow, and granting it the permissions required to
access resources, see
Grant a workflow permission to access Google Cloud resources .
Authentication tokens
By default, HTTP requests don't contain identity or access tokens for security
reasons. You must explicitly add authentication information to your workflow
definition.
To authenticate between Workflows and an HTTP target that requires such
authentication, Workflows uses a token in the authorization
header based on the credentials of the service account attached to the workflow,
and sends the token using HTTPS to the target service. When connecting with
Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run, use an
ID token (OIDC). For
APIs hosted on googleapis.com , use an
access token (OAuth 2.0).
To make an authenticated request from within a workflow, do one of the
following depending on the service you are calling:
External APIs —Use an Authorization request header to authenticate with a
third-party API. In this document, see
Make authenticated requests to external APIs .
Google Cloud APIs —If available, use a Workflows
connector , which automatically provides the
required authentication using the workflow's service account. If you can't
use a connector, use an HTTP
request with OAuth 2.0 to connect with other Google Cloud APIs. Any
API that ends with a hostname of .googleapis.com accepts this authentication
method. In this document, see
Make authenticated requests to Google Cloud APIs .
Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run —Use OIDC to connect
with Cloud Run or Cloud Run functions. In this document,
see
Make requests to Cloud Run or Cloud Run functions .
Private on‑premises, Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE),
or other Google Cloud endpoints —Use Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) with OIDC
to enforce access control policies for your endpoints. For more information,
see
Invoke an IAP-secured endpoint
and
learn how to authenticate to an IAP-secured resource from a user or service account .
Make authenticated requests to external APIs
If you're integrating a third-party API, include an Authorization request
header with the credentials necessary to carry out the authentication. For
example, include an ID token in an
Authorization: Bearer ID_TOKEN header in the request to
the service. For more information, consult the API provider's documentation.
Make authenticated requests to Google Cloud APIs
Note: This authentication method is restricted to HTTPS endpoints with a
hostname that ends in .googleapis.com .
A workflow's service account can generate OAuth 2.0 tokens that the workflow can
use to authenticate to any Google Cloud API. When you use this
authentication method, the workflow authenticates as its associated service
account. To make an HTTP request using the OAuth 2.0 protocol, add an auth
section to the args section of your workflow's definition, after you specify
the URL. In this example, a request is sent to the Compute Engine API to stop a
VM:
YAML
- step_A :
call : http.post
args :
url : https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject1234/zones/us-central1-b/instances/myvm001/stop
auth :
type : OAuth2
scopes : OAUTH_SCOPE
JSON
[
{
"step_A" : {
"call" : "http.post" ,
"args" : {
"url" : "https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject1234/zones/us-central1-b/instances/myvm001/stop" ,
"auth" : {
"type" : "OAuth2" ,
"scopes" : " OAUTH_SCOPE "
}
}
}
}
]
The scopes key is optional, but can be used to specify OAuth 2.0
scopes for the token. Replace OAUTH_SCOPE with a
string or list of strings. Space and comma-separated strings are also
supported. By default, the value is set to
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform .
Make requests to Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run
Note: This authentication method is restricted to HTTPS endpoints.
When making requests to Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run,
use OIDC to authenticate.
To make an HTTP request using OIDC, add an auth section to the args section
of your workflow's definition, after you specify the URL. In this example, a
request is sent to invoke a Cloud Run function:
YAML
- step_A :
call : http.get
args :
url : https://us-central1-project.cloudfunctions.net/functionA
query :
firstNumber : 4
secondNumber : 6
operation : sum
auth :
type : OIDC
audience : OIDC_AUDIENCE
JSON
[
{
"step_A" : {
"call" : "http.get" ,
"args" : {
"url" : "https://us-central1-project.cloudfunctions.net/functionA" ,
"query" : {
"firstNumber" : 4 ,
"secondNumber" : 6 ,
"operation" : "sum"
},
"auth" : {
"type" : "OIDC" ,
"audience" : " OIDC_AUDIENCE "
}
}
}
}
]
The audience key is optional, but can be used to specify the OIDC
audience for the token. By default, OIDC_AUDIENCE is set
to the same value as url .
Note that it's possible for Workflows to invoke
Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run services that have ingress
restricted to internal traffic. With this configuration, your services are
unreachable from the internet but can be reached from Workflows.
For more information, see Invoke Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run .
