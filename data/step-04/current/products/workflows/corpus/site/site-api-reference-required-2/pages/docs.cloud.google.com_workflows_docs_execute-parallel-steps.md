Execute workflow steps in parallel
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Parallel steps can reduce the total execution time for a workflow by
performing multiple blocking calls
at the same time.
Blocking calls such as sleep ,
HTTP calls , and
callbacks can take time, from
milliseconds to days. Parallel steps are intended to assist with such concurrent
long-running operations. If a workflow must perform multiple blocking calls that
are independent of each other, using parallel branches can reduce the total
execution time by starting the calls at the same time, and waiting for all of
them to complete.
For example, if your workflow must retrieve customer data from several
independent systems before continuing, parallel branches allow for concurrent
API requests. If there are five systems and each takes two seconds to respond,
performing the steps sequentially in a workflow could take at least 10 seconds;
performing them in parallel could take as little as two.
Note: Parallel branches provide no performance advantages for non-blocking steps,
such as assignments, conditions, or non-blocking calls. Due to system
overhead, using parallel branches that do not include blocking calls can
increase the total execution time.
Create a parallel step
Create a parallel step to define a part of your workflow where two or more
steps can execute concurrently.
YAML
- PARALLEL_STEP_NAME :
parallel :
exception_policy : POLICY
shared : [ VARIABLE_A , VARIABLE_B , ... ]
concurrency_limit : CONCURRENCY_LIMIT
BRANCHES_OR_FOR :
...
JSON
[
{
" PARALLEL_STEP_NAME " : {
"parallel" : {
"exception_policy" : " POLICY " ,
"shared" : [
" VARIABLE_A " ,
" VARIABLE_B " ,
...
],
"concurrency_limit" : " CONCURRENCY_LIMIT " ,
" BRANCHES_OR_FOR " :
...
}
}
}
]
Replace the following:
PARALLEL_STEP_NAME : the name of the parallel step.
POLICY (optional): determines the action other
branches will take when an unhandled exception occurs. The default policy,
continueAll , results in no further action, and all other branches will
attempt to run. Note that continueAll is the only policy currently supported.
VARIABLE_A , VARIABLE_B , and so
on: a list of writable variables with parent scope that allow assignments
within the parallel step. For more information, see
Shared variables .
CONCURRENCY_LIMIT (optional): the maximum number of
branches and iterations that can concurrently execute within a single workflow
execution before further branches and iterations are queued to wait. This
applies to a single parallel step only and does not cascade. Must be a
positive integer and can be either a literal value or an expression. For
details, see
Concurrency limits .
BRANCHES_OR_FOR : use either branches or for to
indicate one of the following:
Branches that can run concurrently.
A loop where iterations can run concurrently.
Note the following:
Parallel branches and iterations can run in any order, and might run in a
different order with each execution.
Parallel steps can include other, nested parallel steps up to the depth limit.
See Quotas and limits .
For more details, see the syntax reference page for
parallel steps .
Tip: Cloud Run functions (2nd gen) can
take advantage of concurrency through the underlying Cloud Run
service, and give you more control over pricing. When calling
Cloud Run functions in a parallel for step, you can save
costs by setting the concurrency so that multiple items are processed by the
same Cloud Run function instance. Learn more about
configuring concurrency in
Cloud Run .
Replace experimental function with parallel step
If you are using experimental.executions.map to support parallel work, you can
migrate your workflow to use parallel steps instead, executing ordinary
for loops in parallel. For examples, see
Replace experimental function with parallel step .
Samples
These samples demonstrate the syntax.
Perform operations in parallel (using branches)
If your workflow has multiple and different sets of steps that can be executed
at the same time, placing them in parallel branches can decrease the total time
needed to complete those steps.
In the following example, a user ID is passed as an argument to the workflow and
data is retrieved in parallel from two different services.
Shared variables
allow values to be written to in the branches, and read after the branches
complete:
YAML
main :
params : [ input ]
steps :
- init :
assign :
- userProfile : {}
- recentItems : []
- enrichUserData :
parallel :
shared : [ userProfile , recentItems ] # userProfile and recentItems are shared to make them writable in the branches
branches :
- getUserProfileBranch :
steps :
- getUserProfile :
call : http.get
args :
url : '${"https://example.com/users/" + input.userId}'
result : userProfile
- getRecentItemsBranch :
steps :
- getRecentItems :
try :
call : http.get
args :
url : '${"https://example.com/items?userId=" + input.userId}'
result : recentItems
except :
as : e
steps :
- ignoreError :
assign : # continue with an empty list if this call fails
- recentItems : []
JSON
{
"main" : {
"params" : [
"input"
],
"steps" : [
{
"init" : {
"assign" : [
{
"userProfile" : {}
},
{
"recentItems" : []
}
]
}
},
{
"enrichUserData" : {
"parallel" : {
"shared" : [
"userProfile" ,
"recentItems"
],
"branches" : [
{
"getUserProfileBranch" : {
"steps" : [
{
"getUserProfile" : {
"call" : "http.get" ,
"args" : {
"url" : "${\"https://example.com/users/\" + input.userId}"
},
"result" : "userProfile"
}
}
]
}
},
{
"getRecentItemsBranch" : {
"steps" : [
{
"getRecentItems" : {
"try" : {
"call" : "http.get" ,
"args" : {
"url" : "${\"https://example.com/items?userId=\" + input.userId}"
},
"result" : "recentItems"
},
"except" : {
"as" : "e" ,
"steps" : [
{
"ignoreError" : {
"assign" : [
{
"recentItems" : []
}
]
}
}
]
}
}
}
]
}
}
]
}
}
}
]
}
}
Process items in parallel (using a parallel loop)
If you need to perform the same action for each item in a list, you can complete
the execution more quickly by using a parallel loop. A parallel loop allows
multiple loop iterations to be performed in parallel. Note that, unlike
regular for loops , iterations can
be performed in any order.
In the following example, a set of user notifications are processed in a
parallel for loop:
YAML
main :
params : [ input ]
steps :
- sendNotifications :
parallel :
for :
value : notification
in : ${input.notifications}
steps :
- notify :
call : http.post
args :
url : https://example.com/sendNotification
body :
notification : ${notification}
JSON
{
"main" : {
"params" : [
"input"
],
"steps" : [
{
"sendNotifications" : {
"parallel" : {
"for" : {
"value" : "notification" ,
"in" : "${input.notifications}" ,
"steps" : [
{
"notify" : {
"call" : "http.post" ,
"args" : {
"url" : "https://example.com/sendNotification" ,
"body" : {
"notification" : "${notification}"
}
}
}
}
]
}
}
}
}
]
}
}
Aggregate data (using a parallel loop)
You can process a set of items while collecting data from the operations
performed on each item. For example, you might want to track the IDs of created
items, or maintain a list of items with errors.
In the following example, 10 separate queries to a public BigQuery
dataset each return the number of words in a document, or set of documents. A
shared variable
allows the count of the words to accumulate and be read after all the iterations
complete. After calculating the number of words across all the documents, the
workflow returns the total.
YAML
# Use a parallel loop to make ten queries to a public BigQuery dataset and
# use a shared variable to accumulate a count of words; after all iterations
# complete, return the total number of words across all documents
main :
params : [ input ]
steps :
- init :
assign :
- numWords : 0
- corpuses :
- sonnets
- various
- 1kinghenryvi
- 2kinghenryvi
- 3kinghenryvi
- comedyoferrors
- kingrichardiii
- titusandronicus
- tamingoftheshrew
- loveslabourslost
- runQueries :
parallel : # 'numWords' is shared so it can be written within the parallel loop
shared : [ numWords ]
for :
value : corpus
in : ${corpuses}
steps :
- runQuery :
call : googleapis.bigquery.v2.jobs.query
args :
projectId : ${sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID")}
body :
useLegacySql : false
query : ${"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT word) FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare` " + " WHERE corpus='" + corpus + "' "}
result : query
- add :
assign :
- numWords : ${numWords + int(query.rows[0].f[0].v)} # first result is the count
- done :
return : ${numWords}
JSON
{
"main" : {
"params" : [
"input"
],
"steps" : [
{
"init" : {
"assign" : [
{
"numWords" : 0
