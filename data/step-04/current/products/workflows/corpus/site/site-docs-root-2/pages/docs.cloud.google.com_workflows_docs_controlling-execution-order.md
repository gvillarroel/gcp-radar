Control the order of execution in a workflow
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to use jumps or for loops to control the order
in which your workflow's steps run. Basic jumps allow you to define which step
the workflow runs next. Conditional jumps build on basic jumps, allowing you to
use conditional
expressions
to control the order of execution through a workflow. For example, you can run
certain steps only when a variable or response from another workflow step meets
specific criteria.
The examples on this page use a sample API that returns the day of the week.

Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

You should already have an existing workflow where you want to change the
order of execution. To learn how to create and deploy a workflow, see
Create and update a
workflow .
Use jumps to change execution order
By default, all workflows are ordered lists where every step runs
in the order you define in the workflow's source code. You can choose
to override this default ordering by using jumps.
Basic jumps
You can specify which step to run next in a workflow by using basic jumps.
Console
Open the Workflows page in the
Google Cloud console: Go to Workflows
Select the name of the workflow where you want to change the order of
execution of the existing steps.
On the Edit workflow page, select Next to go to the workflow
editor.
Add the next field at the end of a step to tell the workflow to jump
to a particular step:
YAML
- step_a :
...
next : STEP_NAME_TO_JUMP_TO
- step_b :
...
- next_step :
...
JSON
[
{
"step_a" : {
...
"next" : " STEP_NAME_TO_JUMP_TO "
}
}
{
"step_b" : {
...
}
}
{
"next_step" : {
...
}
}
]
Replace STEP_NAME_TO_JUMP_TO with the name
of the step you want the workflow to execute next. For example,
next_step .
Select Deploy .
gcloud
Open your workflow's definition file in the text editor of your choice.
Add the next field at the end of a step to tell the workflow to jump
to a particular step:
YAML
- step_a :
...
next : STEP_NAME_TO_JUMP_TO
- step_b :
...
- next_step :
...
JSON
[
{
"step_a" : {
...
"next" : " STEP_NAME_TO_JUMP_TO "
}
}
{
"step_b" : {
...
}
}
{
"next_step" : {
...
}
}
]
Replace STEP_NAME_TO_JUMP_TO with the name of the
step you want the workflow to execute next. For example, next_step .
Save the workflow file.
To deploy the workflow, enter the following command:
gcloud workflows deploy WORKFLOW_NAME \
--source = WORKFLOW_FILE.YAML
Replace the following:
WORKFLOW_NAME : required. The name of your
workflow.
WORKFLOW_FILE.YAML : required. The source file
for the workflow.
Example
For example, the following workflow has its steps out of order:
YAML
- get_time :
call : http.get
args :
url : https://us-central1-workflowsample.cloudfunctions.net/datetime
result : currentTime
- return_daylight_savings_bool :
return : ${daylightSavings}
- get_daylight_savings_bool :
assign :
- daylightSavings : ${currentTime.body.isDayLightSavingsTime}
JSON
[
{
"get_time" : {
"call" : "http.get" ,
"args" : {
"url" : "https://us-central1-workflowsample.cloudfunctions.net/datetime"
},
"result" : "currentTime"
}
},
{
"return_daylight_savings_bool" : {
"return" : "${daylightSavings}"
}
},
{
"get_daylight_savings_bool" : {
"assign" : [
{
"daylightSavings" : "${currentTime.body.isDayLightSavingsTime}"
}
]
}
}
]
In this example, next fields have been added to the get_daylight_savings_bool
and return_daylight_savings_bool steps so that the steps execute in the
correct order:
YAML
- get_time :
call : http.get
args :
url : https://us-central1-workflowsample.cloudfunctions.net/datetime
result : currentTime
next : get_daylight_savings_bool
- return_daylight_savings_bool :
return : ${daylightSavings}
- get_daylight_savings_bool :
assign :
- daylightSavings : ${currentTime.body.isDayLightSavingsTime}
next : return_daylight_savings_bool
JSON
[
{
"get_time" : {
"call" : "http.get" ,
"args" : {
"url" : "https://us-central1-workflowsample.cloudfunctions.net/datetime"
},
"result" : "currentTime" ,
"next" : "get_daylight_savings_bool"
}
},
{
"return_daylight_savings_bool" : {
"return" : "${daylightSavings}"
}
},
{
"get_daylight_savings_bool" : {
"assign" : [
{
"daylightSavings" : "${currentTime.body.isDayLightSavingsTime}"
}
],
"next" : "return_daylight_savings_bool"
}
}
]
Conditional jumps
You can use conditional jumps to determine which step to run next in a workflow.
Conditional jumps use switch blocks, which jump to a specified step if a
particular condition is met. Each
switch block can include a maximum of 50 conditions.
Console
Open the Workflows page in the
Google Cloud console: Go to Workflows
Select the name of the workflow to which you want to add a switch block.
On the Edit workflow page, select Next to go to the workflow
editor.
On the Define workflow page, your workflow's current definition is
displayed. To edit the workflow so that it executes a certain step based
on a conditional statement, add a step that uses a switch block:
YAML
- SWITCH_STEP_NAME :
switch :
- condition : ${ EXPRESSION_ONE }
next : STEP_A
- condition : ${ EXPRESSION_TWO }
next : STEP_B
...
next : STEP_C
- STEP_A
...
- STEP_B
...
- STEP_C
...
JSON
[
{
" SWITCH_STEP_NAME " : {
"switch" : [
{
"condition" : "${ EXPRESSION_ONE }" ,
"next" : " STEP_A "
},
{
"condition" : "${ EXPRESSION_TWO }" ,
"next" : " STEP_B "
}
],
"next" : " STEP_C "
}
" STEP_A " : {
...
}
" STEP_B " : {
...
}
" STEP_C " : {
...
}
}
]
Replace the following:
SWITCH_STEP_NAME : the name of the step
containing the switch block.
EXPRESSION_ONE : the first expression to
evaluate. If this expression evaluates to true, the workflow executes
STEP_A next. If this expression evaluates to false, the workflow
evaluates the next expression.
EXPRESSION_TWO : the second expression to
evaluate. If this expression evaluates to true, the workflow executes
STEP_B next. If this expression evaluates to false, the workflow
executes STEP_C .
STEP_A , STEP_B ,
STEP_C : placeholder step names.
Select Deploy .
gcloud
Open your workflow's definition in the text editor of your choice.
To edit the workflow so that it executes a certain step based on a
conditional statement, add a step that uses a switch block:
YAML
- SWITCH_STEP_NAME :
switch :
- condition : ${ EXPRESSION_ONE }
next : STEP_A
- condition : ${ EXPRESSION_TWO }
next : STEP_B
...
next : STEP_C
- STEP_A
...
- STEP_B
...
- STEP_C
...
JSON
[
{
" SWITCH_STEP_NAME " : {
"switch" : [
{
"condition" : "${ EXPRESSION_ONE }" ,
"next" : " STEP_A "
},
{
"condition" : "${ EXPRESSION_TWO }" ,
"next" : " STEP_B "
}
],
"next" : " STEP_C "
}
" STEP_A " : {
...
}
" STEP_B " : {
...
}
" STEP_C " : {
...
}
}
]
Replace the following:
SWITCH_STEP_NAME : the name of the step
containing the switch block.
EXPRESSION_ONE : the first expression to
evaluate. If this expression evaluates to true, the workflow executes
STEP_A next. If this expression evaluates to false, the workflow
evaluates the next expression.
EXPRESSION_TWO : the second expression to
evaluate. If this expression evaluates to true, the workflow executes
STEP_B next. If this expression evaluates to false, the workflow
executes STEP_C .
STEP_A , STEP_B ,
STEP_C : placeholder step names.
Save the workflow file.
To deploy the workflow, enter the following command:
gcloud workflows deploy WORKFLOW_NAME \
--source = WORKFLOW_FILE.YAML
Replace the following:
WORKFLOW_NAME : required. The name of your
workflow.
WORKFLOW_FILE.YAML : required. The source file
for the workflow.
Example
For example, this workflow uses a switch block to control the workflow's
order of execution:
YAML
- getCurrentTime :
call : http.get
args :
url : https://us-central1-workflowsample.cloudfunctions.net/datetime
result : currentTime
- conditionalSwitch :
switch :
- condition : ${currentTime.body.dayOfTheWeek == "Friday"}
next : friday
- condition : ${currentTime.body.dayOfTheWeek == "Saturday" OR currentTime.body.dayOfTheWeek == "Sunday"}
next : weekend
next : workWeek
- friday :
return : "It's Friday! Almost the weekend!"
- weekend :
return : "It's the weekend!"
- workWeek :
return : "It's the work week."
JSON
[
{
"getCurrentTime" : {
"call" : "http.get" ,
"args" : {
"url" : "https://us-central1-workflowsample.cloudfunctions.net/datetime"
},
"result" : "currentTime"
}
},
{
"conditionalSwitch" : {
"switch" : [
{
"condition" : "${currentTime.body.dayOfTheWeek == " Friday "}" ,
"next" : "friday"
},
{
"condition" : "${currentTime.body.dayOfTheWeek == " Sa tur day " OR currentTime.body.dayOfTheWeek == " Su n day "}" ,
"next" : "weekend"
}
],
"next" : "workWeek"
}
},
{
"friday" : {
"return" : "It's Friday! Almost the weekend!"
}
},
{
"weekend" : {
"return" : "It's the weekend!"
}
},
{
"workWeek" : {
"return" : "It's the work week."
}
}
]
In this example, the switch block has two conditions. The parser evaluates
each condition in order, and if the result of the condition's expression is true ,
that condition's next step is called. If none of the conditions are met,
the workflow calls the step specified by the next field outside of the
switch block, which, in this example, is the step workWeek .
For example, if the day of the week is "Saturday" , then the workflow jumps to
the step weekend and returns the message "It's the weekend!" . The workflow
doesn't execute the step friday because the conditional jump skips over it,
and the workflow doesn't execute the step workWeek because return stops the
execution of the workflow at the end of the weekend step.
Use for loops to iterate
You can use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers or through a
collection of data, such as a list or map.
You can walk through every item in a list or map using item-based
iteration. If you have a specific range of numeric values to iterate through,
you can use range-based iteration.
For more information and examples, see the syntax reference on iteration .
