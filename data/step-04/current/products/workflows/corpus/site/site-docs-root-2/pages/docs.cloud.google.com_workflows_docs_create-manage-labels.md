Label workflows
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Labels are key-value pairs that you can use to identify and group related
workflows and store metadata about a workflow. You can specify multiple labels
for a workflow.
This page explains how you can use labels with your workflows. It also describes
how to add, update, and remove the labels for a workflow.
Note: Workflow labels are inherited by executions of the workflow.
To group workflows and other resources across Google Cloud for
reporting, auditing, and access control in your Google Cloud organization,
use tags . Tags and labels work
independently of each other, and you can apply both to the same workflow.
What are labels?
A label is a key-value pair that you can assign to Google Cloud workflows.
They help you organize these resources and manage your costs at scale, with the
granularity you need. You can attach a label to each resource, then filter the
resources based on their labels. Information about labels is forwarded to the billing system that
lets you break down your billed charges by label. With built-in billing reports ,
you can filter and group costs by resource labels.
You can also use labels to
query billing data exports .
Requirements for labels
The labels applied to a resource must meet the following
requirements:
Each resource can have up to 64 labels.
Each label must be a key-value pair.
Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum length of 63
characters, and cannot be empty. Values can be empty, and have a maximum length
of 63 characters.
Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters,
underscores, and dashes. All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and
international characters are allowed. Keys must start with a lowercase letter or
international character.
The key portion of a label must be unique within a single resource.
However, you can use the same key with multiple resources.
These limits apply to the key and value for each label, and to the
individual Google Cloud resources that have labels. There
is no limit on how many labels you can apply across all resources
within a project.
Common uses of labels
Here are some common use cases for labels:
Team or cost center labels : Add labels based on team or
cost center to distinguish workflows owned by different
teams (for example, team:research and team:analytics ). You can use this
type of label for cost accounting or budgeting.
Component labels : For example, component:redis ,
component:frontend , component:ingest , and component:dashboard .
Environment or stage labels : For example,
environment:production and environment:test .
State labels : For example, state:active ,
state:readytodelete , and state:archive .
Ownership labels : Used to identify the teams that are
responsible for operations, for example: team:shopping-cart .
Note: Don't include sensitive information in labels, including
personally identifiable information, such as an individual's name or title.
Labels are not designed to handle sensitive information.
We don't recommend creating large numbers of unique labels, such as
for timestamps or individual values for every API call.
The problem with this approach is that when the values change frequently or with
keys that clutter the catalog, this makes it difficult to effectively filter and
report on resources.
Labels and tags
Labels can be used as queryable annotations for resources, but can't be used
to set conditions on policies. Tags provide a way to conditionally allow or
deny policies based on whether a resource has a specific tag, by providing fine-grained
control over policies. For more information, see the
Tags overview .
Add or update labels
You can add one or more labels to a workflow when you
create a workflow .
You can also add or edit labels when
updating a workflow .
If you update an existing label, or add a new one, it can take up to 10 minutes
for the new label to take effect.
Filter workflows by label
You can search for and list specific workflows by filtering them by label.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Workflows page:
Go to Workflows
In the
filter_list
Filter field, select Labels as the filter criteria and, in the
Values list, select a key-value pair.
gcloud
Use the --filter flag with the
gcloud workflows list command:
gcloud workflows list \
--filter labels. KEY = VALUE
Replace KEY and VALUE with
a label key-value pair.
For more information about the filter syntax in the Google Cloud CLI,
see gcloud topic filters .
Workflow labels are inherited by executions of the workflow. To view execution
labels, use the workflows.executions.list method to
list and filter workflow executions .
Delete labels
You can delete a specific label using the Google Cloud console, or you can use
the gcloud CLI to delete all the labels from a workflow.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Workflows page:
Go to Workflows
Click the name of the workflow you want to update.
The Workflow details page appears.
Click
edit
Edit .
The Edit workflow page appears.
Next to the label that you want to remove, click
delete
Delete item .
Click Next .
To redeploy the workflow, click Deploy .
gcloud
Use the --labels flag with an empty value and the
gcloud workflows deploy command:
gcloud workflows deploy WORKFLOW_NAME \
--labels = "" \
--source = YAML_OR_JSON_SOURCE_FILE
Replace the following:
WORKFLOW_NAME : the name of your workflow.
YAML_OR_JSON_SOURCE_FILE : the source file for the
workflow in either YAML or JSON format. For example: myFirstWorkflow.yaml .
