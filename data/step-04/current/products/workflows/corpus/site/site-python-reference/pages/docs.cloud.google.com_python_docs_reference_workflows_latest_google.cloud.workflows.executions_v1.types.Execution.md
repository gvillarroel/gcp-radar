Execution ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
A running instance of a
Workflow </workflows/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.workflows> __.
Attributes
Name
Description
name
str
Output only. The resource name of the
execution. Format:
projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workflows/{workflow}/executions/{execution}
start_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
Output only. Marks the beginning of
execution.
end_time
google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp
Output only. Marks the end of execution,
successful or not.
duration
google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration
Output only. Measures the duration of the
execution.
state
google.cloud.workflows.executions_v1.types.Execution.State
Output only. Current state of the execution.
argument
str
Input parameters of the execution represented as a JSON
string. The size limit is 32KB.
*Note*: If you are using the REST API directly to run your
workflow, you must escape any JSON string value of
argument . Example:
'{"argument":"{\"firstName\":\"FIRST\",\"lastName\":\"LAST\"}"}'
result
str
Output only. Output of the execution represented as a JSON
string. The value can only be present if the execution's
state is SUCCEEDED .
error
google.cloud.workflows.executions_v1.types.Execution.Error
Output only. The error which caused the execution to finish
prematurely. The value is only present if the execution's
state is FAILED or CANCELLED .
workflow_revision_id
str
Output only. Revision of the workflow this
execution is using.
call_log_level
google.cloud.workflows.executions_v1.types.Execution.CallLogLevel
The call logging level associated to this
execution.
status
google.cloud.workflows.executions_v1.types.Execution.Status
Output only. Status tracks the current steps
and progress data of this execution.
labels
MutableMapping[str, str]
Labels associated with this execution.
Labels can contain at most 64 entries. Keys and
values can be no longer than 63 characters and
can only contain lowercase letters, numeric
characters, underscores, and dashes. Label keys
must start with a letter. International
characters are allowed.
By default, labels are inherited from the
workflow but are overridden by any labels
associated with the execution.
state_error
google.cloud.workflows.executions_v1.types.Execution.StateError
Output only. Error regarding the state of the
Execution resource. For example, this field will
have error details if the execution data is
unavailable due to revoked KMS key permissions.
Classes
CallLogLevel
CallLogLevel ( value )
Describes the level of platform logging to apply to calls and
call responses during workflow executions.
Error
Error ( mapping = None , * , ignore_unknown_fields = False , ** kwargs )
Error describes why the execution was abnormally terminated.

Parameters
Name
Description
kwargs
