Best practices for Workflows
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
You can refer to the best practices listed here when orchestrating your services
using Workflows.
This is not an exhaustive list of recommendations and doesn't teach you the
basics of how to use Workflows. This document assumes that you
already have a general understanding of the overall Google Cloud landscape and
of Workflows. For more information, see the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework and the
Workflows overview .
Select an optimal communication pattern
When designing a microservices architecture for deploying multiple services, you
can select from the following communication patterns:
Direct service-to-service communication
Indirect event-driven communication (also known as choreography )
Automated configuration, coordination, and management (also known as
orchestration )
Make sure to consider the benefits and drawbacks of each of the preceding
options and select an optimal pattern for your use case. For example, direct
service-to-service communication might be simpler to implement than other
options but it tightly couples your services. In contrast, an
event-driven architecture lets
you loosely couple your services; however, monitoring and debugging might be
more complicated. Finally, a central orchestrator like Workflows, while
less flexible, lets you coordinate the communication between services without
the tight coupling of direct service-to-service communication, or the intricacy
of choreographed events.
You can also combine communication patterns. For example, in event-driven
orchestration, closely-related services are managed in an orchestration that is
triggered by an event . Similarly,
you might design a system where one orchestration results in
a Pub/Sub message to another
orchestrated system.
General tips
Once you've decided to use Workflows as your service orchestrator,
keep in mind the following helpful tips.
Avoid hardcoding URLs
You can support workflows that are portable across multiple environments and
easier to maintain by avoiding hardcoded URLs. You can achieve this in the
following ways:
Define URLs as runtime arguments .
This can be helpful when your workflow is invoked through a client library or
the API. (However, this won't work if your workflow is triggered by
an event from Eventarc
and the only argument that can be passed is the event payload.)
Example
main :
params : [ args ]
steps :
- init :
assign :
- url1 : ${args.urls.url1}
- url2 : ${args.urls.url2}
When you run the workflow, you can specify the URLs. For example:
gcloud workflows run multi-env --data='{"urls":{"url1" : " URL_ONE " , "url2" : " URL_TWO " }} '
Use environment variables and
create a workflow that is dynamically configured depending on the environment
to which it is deployed. Or, create a workflow that can be reused as a
template and configured according to separately maintained environment
variables.
Use a substitution technique that lets you create a single workflow
definition file, but deploy variants by using a tool that replaces placeholders
in your workflow. For example, you can
use Cloud Build to
deploy a workflow and in the Cloud Build configuration file, add a
step to replace placeholder URLs in the workflow.
Example
steps :
‐ id : 'replace-urls'
name : 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
entrypoint : bash
args :
- -c
- |
sed -i -e "s~REPLACE_url1~$_URL1~" workflow.yaml
sed -i -e "s~REPLACE_url2~$_URL2~" workflow.yaml
‐ id : 'deploy-workflow'
name : 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
args : [ 'workflows' , 'deploy' , 'multi-env-$_ENV' , '--source' , 'workflow.yaml' ]
You can then
substitute variable values at build time. For example:
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml \
--substitutions=_ENV=staging,_URL1=" URL_ONE ",_URL2=" URL_TWO "
For more information, see
Submit a build via CLI and API .
Or, you can use Terraform
to provision your infrastructure and define a configuration file that
creates workflows for each environment by using
input variables .
Example
variable "project_id" {
type = string
}
variable "url1" {
type = string
}
variable "url2" {
type = string
}
locals {
env = [ "staging", "prod" ]
}
# Define and deploy staging and production workflows
resource "google_workflows_workflow" "multi-env-workflows" {
for_each = toset ( local.env )
name = "multi-env-${each.key}"
project = var.project_id
region = "us-central1"
source_contents = templatefile ( "${path.module}/workflow.yaml", { url1 : "${var.url1}-${each.key}", url2 : "${var.url2}-${each.key}" })
}
When variables are declared in the root module of your configuration,
they can be
assigned values
in a number of ways. For example
terraform apply -var = "project_id= PROJECT_ID " -var = "url1= URL_ONE " -var = "url2= URL_TWO "
Use the Secret Manager connector
to securely store URLs in Secret Manager and retrieve them.
Use nested steps
Every workflow must have at least one step .
By default, Workflows treats steps as if they are in an ordered
list and executes them one at a time until all the steps have run. Logically,
some steps should be grouped together and you can use a steps block to nest a
series of steps. This is convenient as it lets you point to the correct atomic
step to process a set of steps.
Example
main :
params : [ input ]
steps :
- callWikipedia :
steps :
- checkSearchTermInInput :
switch :
- condition : ${"searchTerm" in input}
assign :
- searchTerm : ${input.searchTerm}
next : readWikipedia
- getCurrentDate :
call : http.get
args :
url : https://timeapi.io/api/Time/current/zone?timeZone=Europe/Amsterdam
result : currentDate
- setFromCallResult :
assign :
- searchTerm : ${currentDate.body.dayOfWeek}
- readWikipedia :
call : http.get
args :
url : https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php
query :
action : opensearch
search : ${searchTerm}
result : wikiResult
- returnOutput :
return : ${wikiResult.body[1]}
Wrap expressions
All expressions must begin with
a $ and be enclosed in curly brackets:
${ EXPRESSION }
To avoid YAML parsing issues, you can wrap expressions in quotes. For example,
expressions containing colons
can cause unexpected behaviour when the colon is interpreted as defining a map.
You can resolve this issue by wrapping the YAML expression in single quotes:
'${"Name: " + myVar}'
You can also use expressions that span several lines. For example, you might
need to wrap a SQL query in quotes when using the Workflows
BigQuery connector.
Example
- runQuery :
call : googleapis.bigquery.v2.jobs.query
args :
projectId : ${sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID")}
body :
useLegacySql : false
useQueryCache : false
timeoutMs : 30000
# Find top 100 titles with most views on Wikipedia
query : ${
"SELECT TITLE, SUM(views)
FROM `bigquery-samples.wikipedia_pageviews." + table + "`
WHERE LENGTH(TITLE) > 10
GROUP BY TITLE
ORDER BY SUM(VIEWS) DESC
LIMIT 100"
}
result : queryResult
For the entire workflow definition, see
Run multiple BigQuery jobs in parallel .
Use declarative calls
Use Workflows to call services from the workflow itself and
handle the results, and to execute simple tasks like
making an HTTP call . Workflows
can invoke services, parse responses, and
construct inputs for other connected services .
Calling a service lets you avoid the complications of extra invocations,
additional dependencies, and services calling services. Consider replacing
services that are free of business logic with declarative API calls and use
Workflows to abstract away complexity.
However, you should create services to do any work that is too complex
for Workflows; for example, implementing reusable business logic,
complex computations, or transformations that are not supported by
Workflows expressions and its standard library .
A complicated case is typically easier to implement in code, instead of using
YAML or JSON and the Workflows syntax .
Store only what you need
Keep memory consumption under control so that you don't encounter
resource limits or an error that indicates
this such as ResourceLimitError , MemoryLimitExceededError , or
ResultSizeLimitExceededError .
Be selective about what you store in
variables , filtering for and
storing only what you need. If a service returns a payload that is too large,
use a separate function to make the call for you and return only what is required.
You can free memory by clearing variables. For example, you might want to free
up memory that is needed for subsequent steps. Or, you might have calls with
results you don't care about, and you can omit those results altogether.
You can clear a variable by assigning null . In YAML, you can also assign an
empty value or ~ to a variable. This identifies memory that can be safely
reclaimed.
Example
- step :
assign :
- bigVar :
Use subworkflows and external workflows
You can use subworkflows to
define a piece of logic or a set of steps that you want to call multiple times,
simplifying the workflow definition. Subworkflows are similar to a function or
routine in a programming language. They can accept parameters and return values,
allowing you to create more complex workflows with a broader range of applications.
Note that subworkflows are local to your workflow definition and can't be reused
in other workflows. However, you can
call workflows from other workflows .
The Workflows connectors can help you with this. For more
information, see the connector overviews for the
Workflow Executions API
and the Workflows API .
Use Workflows connectors
Workflows provides a number of connectors that make it easier
to access other Google Cloud products within a workflow. Connectors
simplify calling services because they handle the formatting of requests for you,
providing methods and arguments so that you don't need to know the details of a
Google Cloud API. Connectors also have built-in behavior for handling
retries and
long-running operations so that you can avoid
iterating and waiting for calls to complete; connectors take care of this for you.
If you need to call a Google Cloud API, first check to see if a
Workflows connector for it exists. And if you don't see a
connector for a Google Cloud product, you can
request it .
Learn how to use a connector
and, for a detailed reference of available connectors, see the
Connectors reference .
Run workflow steps in parallel
While Workflows can run steps sequentially, you can also run
independent steps in parallel. In some cases, this can significantly speed up
your workflow execution. For more information, see
Execute workflow steps in parallel .
Apply retries and the saga pattern
Design workflows that are resilient and can handle both transient and permanent
service failures. Errors for Workflows might be raised, for example, by
failed HTTP requests, functions, connectors, or generated by your own workflow
code. Add error handling and retries so that a failure in one step doesn't cause
the entire workflow to fail.
You can raise custom errors
using the raise syntax.
You can catch errors using
a try/except block.
You can retry steps using a
try/retry block and define the maximum number of retry attempts.
Some business transactions span multiple services so you need a mechanism to
implement transactions that span services. The saga design pattern is a way to
manage data consistency across microservices in distributed transaction scenarios.
A saga is a sequence of transactions that publishes an event for every
transaction and which triggers the next transaction. If a transaction fails, the
saga executes compensating transactions that counteract the preceding failures
in the sequence. Try out the
Retries and Saga Pattern in Workflows tutorial
on GitHub.
Use callbacks to wait
Callbacks allow workflow
executions to wait for another service to make a request to the
callback endpoint ; that request resumes the execution of the workflow.
With callbacks, you can signal to your workflow that a specified event has
occurred, and wait on that event without polling .
For example, you can create a workflow that notifies you when a product is back
in stock or when an item has shipped; or that
waits to allow human interaction
such as reviewing an order or validating a translation. You can also
wait for events using callbacks and Eventarc triggers .
Orchestrate long-running jobs
If you need to execute long-running
batch processing
workloads, you can use Batch or
Cloud Run jobs , and you can use
Workflows to manage the services. This lets you combine
advantages and efficiently provision and orchestrate the entire process.
Batch is a fully managed service that lets you
schedule, queue, and execute batch workloads on Compute Engine virtual
machine (VM) instances. You can use the
Workflows connector for Batch
to schedule and run a Batch job. For details, try out
the tutorial .
Cloud Run jobs are used to run code that performs work (a job)
and quits when the work is done. Workflows lets you execute
Cloud Run jobs as part of a workflow to perform more complex data
processing or orchestrate a system of existing jobs. Try out
the tutorial which
demonstrates how to use Workflows to execute a
Cloud Run job.
Containerize long-running tasks
You can automate the execution of a long-running container using
Workflows and Compute Engine. For example, you can
containerize a long-running task so that it can run anywhere, and then run the
container on a Compute Engine VM for the maximum duration of a workflow
execution (one year).
Using Workflows, you can automate the creation of the VM, the
running of the container on the VM, and the deletion of the VM. This lets you
use a server and run a container, but it abstracts away the complexity of
managing both, and can be helpful if you run into time limitations when using
a service such as Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run. Try out the
Long running containers with Workflows and Compute Engine
tutorial on GitHub.
Run command-line tools from Workflows
Cloud Build is a service that executes your builds
on Google Cloud as a series of build steps, where each build step is run in a
Docker container. Executing build steps is analogous to executing commands in a
script.
The Google Cloud CLI includes the gcloud , bq , and
kubectl command-line tools but there is no direct way to run gcloud CLI
commands from Workflows. However, Cloud Build
provides container images that include the gcloud CLI. You can run
gcloud CLI commands in those containers from a Cloud Build
step, and you can create that step in Workflows using the
Cloud Build connector .
Example
Run gcloud in a workflow:
# This example shows how to execute gcloud commands from Workflows
# using Cloud Build and returns the output
main :
steps :
- execute_command :
call : gcloud
args :
args : "workflows list"
result : result
- return_result :
return : ${result}
gcloud :
params : [ args ]
steps :
- create_build :
call : googleapis.cloudbuild.v1.projects.builds.create
args :
projectId : ${sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID")}
parent : ${"projects/" + sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID") + "/locations/global"}
body :
serviceAccount : ${sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME")}
options :
logging : CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY
steps :
- name : gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk
entrypoint : /bin/bash
args : ${["-c", "gcloud " + args + " > $$BUILDER_OUTPUT/output"]}
result : result_builds_create
- return_build_result :
return : ${text.split(text.decode(base64.decode(result_builds_create.metadata.build.results.buildStepOutputs[0])), "\n")}
Run kubectl in a workflow:
# This example shows how to execute kubectl commands from Workflows
# using Cloud Build and returns the output
main :
steps :
- execute_command :
call : kubectl
args :
args : "--help"
result : result
- return_result :
return : ${result}
kubectl :
params : [ args ]
steps :
- create_build :
call : googleapis.cloudbuild.v1.projects.builds.create
args :
projectId : ${sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID")}
parent : ${"projects/" + sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID") + "/locations/global"}
body :
serviceAccount : ${sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME")}
options :
logging : CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY
steps :
- name : gcr.io/cloud-builders/kubectl
entrypoint : /bin/bash
args : ${["-c", "kubectl " + args + " > $$BUILDER_OUTPUT/output"]}
result : result_builds_create
- return_build_result :
return : ${text.split(text.decode(base64.decode(result_builds_create.metadata.build.results.buildStepOutputs[0])), "\n")}
Use Terraform to create your workflow
Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool
that lets you predictably create, change, and improve your cloud infrastructure
by using code.
You can define and deploy a workflow using the Terraform
google_workflows_workflow
resource. For more information, see
Create a workflow by using Terraform .
To help you manage and maintain large workflows, you can create your workflow
in a separate YAML file and import that file into Terraform using the
templatefile function
which reads a file at a given path and renders its content as a template.
Example
# Define a workflow
resource "google_workflows_workflow" "workflows_example" {
name = "sample-workflow"
region = var.region
description = "A sample workflow"
service_account = google_service_account.workflows_service_account.id
# Import main workflow YAML file
source_contents = templatefile("${path.module}/workflow.yaml",{})
}
Similarly, if you have a main workflow calling multiple subworkflows, you can
define the main workflow and the subworkflows in separate files, and use the
templatefile function to import them.
Example
# Define a workflow
resource "google_workflows_workflow" "workflows_example" {
name = "sample-workflow"
region = var.region
description = "A sample workflow"
service_account = google_service_account.workflows_service_account.id
# Import main workflow and subworkflow YAML files
source_contents = join("", [
templatefile(
"${path.module}/workflow.yaml",{}
),
templatefile(
"${path.module}/subworkflow.yaml",{}
)])
}
Note that if you're referring to line numbers when debugging a workflow, all the
YAML files imported through the Terraform configuration file are merged and
deployed as a single workflow.
Deploy a workflow from a Git repository
Cloud Build uses
build triggers to enable CI/CD automation. You can
configure triggers to listen for incoming events, such as when a new commit is
pushed to a repository or when a pull request is initiated, and then
automatically execute a build when new events come in.
You can use a Cloud Build trigger to automatically start a build
and deploy a workflow from a Git repository. You can configure the trigger to
deploy your workflow on any change to the source repository, or deploy the
workflow only when the change matches specific criteria.
This approach can help you manage your deployment lifecycle. For example, you
can deploy changes to a workflow in a staging environment, run tests against
that environment, and then incrementally launch these changes to the
production environment. For more information, see
Deploy a workflow from a Git repository using Cloud Build .
Optimize usage
The cost to run a workflow is
minimal. However, for high volume usage, apply the following guidelines to
optimize usage and decrease cost:
Instead of using custom domains, ensure that any calls to Google Cloud
services use *.appspot.com , *.cloud.goog , *.cloudfunctions.net , or
*.run.app so that you are billed for internal and not external steps.
Apply a custom retry policy
that balances your latency and reliability needs with costs. More frequent
retries lower latency and increase reliability, but can also increase costs.
When using connectors that wait for long-running operations, set a
custom polling policy
that optimizes latency for cost. For example, if you expect an operation to take
over an hour, you might want a policy that initially polls after one minute in
case of an immediate failure, and then every 15 minutes after that.
Combine assignments
into one step.
Avoid excessive use of sys.log steps. Consider using
call logging instead.
Understand which operations are considered a step. Operations that don't count
as steps on their own are counted when used within an applicable step. For
example, the following counts as one step:
- type_check :
return : if(get_type((int("6"))) == integer, 1, 2)
Key operations that count and don't count toward the
maximum steps limit are categorized in the
following table:
Category
Operation
Counts as a step
Data operations: Assigning, returning values
Controlling flow: Jumps ( next ), switches, starting a
for loop, and each iteration of a for loop
Calls: Invoking sys.get_env or other standard library
function, another workflow, or a connector
Concurrency: Spawning threads and parallel execution
Error handling: Each raise , try ,
retry , and except block counts as a separate
step, even if other operations are part of the same larger step.
For example, a step that includes a try block with a
call operation counts as three steps: one for the primary step, one
for the try, and one for the call. Adding a retry block
adds three more steps (one each for the retry, try, and call), making
a total of six steps.
Doesn't count as a step
Reading and writing to
lists ,
maps , and
variables
Although an individual lookup doesn't add an extra step, a step
that contains the lookup—for example, an
assign
step—counts as one step.

built-in expression helper functions : len() , int() , and
get_type()
