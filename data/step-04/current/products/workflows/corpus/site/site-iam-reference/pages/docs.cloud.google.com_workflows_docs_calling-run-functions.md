Invoke Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Calling or invoking a Google Cloud service such as Cloud Run functions
or Cloud Run from Workflows is done through an HTTP
request. The most common HTTP request methods have a call shortcut (such as
http.get
and http.post ), but you can make
any type of HTTP request by setting the call field to http.request and
specifying the type of request using the method field. For
more information, see Make an HTTP request .
Note: Invoking a Google Cloud service through an HTTP request should not
be confused with using Workflows connectors
to perform API operations with other Google Cloud products.
To send authenticated requests:
Your workflow must be associated with a service account that has been granted
one or more Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles containing the required
permissions.
You must explicitly add authentication information to your workflow
definition. By default, HTTP requests do not contain identity or access tokens
for security reasons.
For more information, see
Grant a workflow permission to access Google Cloud resources .
When to call a service
How do you know when to create steps in YAML or JSON using the Workflows
syntax or when to create a service—for example, a Cloud Run service
or a Cloud Run function—to do the work instead?
Create services to do any work that is too complex for Workflows;
for example, implementing reusable business logic, complex computations, or
transformations that are not supported by Workflows expressions and its
standard library. A complicated case is typically easier to implement in code,
instead of using YAML or JSON and the Workflows syntax.
Invoke services that are restricted to internal ingress
Workflows can invoke Cloud Run functions
or Cloud Run services in the same Google Cloud project
that have ingress restricted to internal traffic. With this configuration, your
services are unreachable from the internet but can be reached from
Workflows.
To apply these restrictions, you must adjust the ingress settings of your
service or function. Note that the Cloud Run service must be
reached on its run.app URL and not at a custom domain. For more information,
see Restrict network ingress (for Cloud Run)
and Configure network settings
(for Cloud Run functions). No other changes are needed to your
workflow.
Use a service account with the required permissions
When making requests to other Google Cloud services, your workflow must
be associated with a service account that has the correct permissions to access
the requested resources. To learn what service account is associated with an
existing workflow, see Verify a workflow's associated service account .
When setting up a service account, you associate the requesting identity with the
resource you wish to give it access to—you make the requesting identity a
principal of the resource—and then assign it the appropriate role .
The role defines what permissions the identity has in the context of the resource.
For example, to configure a receiving Cloud Run function to
accept requests from a specific calling function or service, you need to add the
caller's service account as a principal on the receiving function and grant that
principal the Cloud Run functions Invoker ( roles/cloudfunctions.invoker )
role. Similarly, to set up a service account for Cloud Run, you
grant that service account the Cloud Run Invoker
( roles/run.invoker ) role. To learn more, see
Access control with IAM
or the Cloud Run authentication overview .
Invoke Cloud Run functions
In Cloud Run functions, invocation permissions are available by
managing the underlying Cloud Run service. If your workflow is invoking
a Cloud Run functions service, you don't need to grant the caller's
service account the Cloud Functions Invoker
( roles/cloudfunctions.invoker ) role. Instead, you must grant the
Cloud Run Invoker ( roles/run.invoker ) role.
For more information, see
Compare Cloud Run functions .
Add authentication information to your workflow
Note: This authentication method is restricted to HTTPS endpoints.
When making requests to Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run,
use OIDC to authenticate.
To make an HTTP request using OIDC, add an auth section to the args section
of your workflow's definition, after you specify the URL. In this example, a
request is sent to invoke a Cloud Run function:
YAML
- step_A :
call : http.get
args :
url : https://us-central1-project.cloudfunctions.net/functionA
query :
firstNumber : 4
secondNumber : 6
operation : sum
auth :
type : OIDC
audience : OIDC_AUDIENCE
JSON
[
{
"step_A" : {
"call" : "http.get" ,
"args" : {
"url" : "https://us-central1-project.cloudfunctions.net/functionA" ,
"query" : {
"firstNumber" : 4 ,
"secondNumber" : 6 ,
"operation" : "sum"
},
"auth" : {
"type" : "OIDC" ,
"audience" : " OIDC_AUDIENCE "
}
}
}
}
]
The audience parameter can be used to specify the OIDC audience for the token.
By default, it's set to the same value as url ; however, it should be set to
your service's root URL. For example: https://region-project.cloudfunctions.net/hello_world .
Specify the media type for the response data
If the Content-Type header for the response specifies an
application/json media type, the JSON response that is stored in a
variable is automatically converted to a map that can be accessed.
If necessary, modify the API that is being called to specify an
application/json media type for the Content-Type
response header. Otherwise, you can use the
json.decode
and text.encode functions to
convert the response body into a map. For example:
json.decode(text.encode( RESPONSE_FROM_API ))
For more information, see
Access HTTP response data saved in a variable .
Execute Cloud Run jobs
Unlike Cloud Run services,
Cloud Run jobs do not listen for or
serve HTTP requests. To execute Cloud Run jobs from a workflow,
use the
Cloud Run Admin API connector .
For an end-to-end example of executing a Cloud Run job that
processes data passed as environment variables to the job, see
Execute a Cloud Run job using Workflows .
For an end-to-end example of executing a Cloud Run job that
processes data stored in a Cloud Storage bucket allowing you to
encrypt the data using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK), see
Execute a Cloud Run job that processes event data in Cloud Storage .
