Run a batch translation using the Cloud Translation connector
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial shows you how to create a workflow that uses the
Cloud Translation API connector
to translate files to other languages in asynchronous batch mode. This provides
real-time output as the inputs are being processed.
Objectives
In this tutorial you will:
Create an input Cloud Storage bucket.
Create two files in English and upload them to the input bucket.
Create a workflow that uses the Cloud Translation API connector to translate the
two files to French and Spanish and saves the results in an output bucket.
Deploy and execute the workflow to orchestrate the entire process.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Cloud Storage
Translation
Workflows

Before you begin
Security constraints defined by your organization might prevent you from completing the
following steps. For troubleshooting information, see
Develop applications in a constrained Google Cloud environment .
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Cloud Storage, Translation, and Workflows APIs:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com translate.googleapis.com workflows.googleapis.com

Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.

gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com translate.googleapis.com workflows.googleapis.com
Update gcloud components:
gcloud components update
Log in using your account:
gcloud auth login
Set the default location used in this tutorial:
gcloud config set workflows/location us-central1
Since this tutorial uses the default AutoML Translation model which
resides in us-central1 , you must set the location to us-central1 .
If using an AutoML Translation model or glossary other than the
default, ensure that it resides in the same
location as the call to the connector;
otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT (400) error is returned. For details,
see the
batchTranslateText method .
Create an input Cloud Storage bucket and files
You can use Cloud Storage to store objects. Objects are immutable
pieces of data consisting of a file of any format, and are stored in containers
called buckets.
Create a Cloud Storage bucket to hold the files to translate:
BUCKET_INPUT = ${ GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT } -input-files
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// ${ BUCKET_INPUT }
Create two files in English and upload them to the input bucket:
echo "Hello World!" > file1.txt
gcloud storage cp file1.txt gs:// ${ BUCKET_INPUT }
echo "Workflows connectors simplify calling services." > file2.txt
gcloud storage cp file2.txt gs:// ${ BUCKET_INPUT }
Deploy and execute the workflow
A workflow is made up of a series of steps described using the
Workflows syntax, which can be written in either YAML or JSON
format. This is the workflow's definition. After creating a workflow, you deploy
it to make it available for execution.
Create a text file with the filename workflow.yaml and with the following
content:
main :
steps :
- init :
assign :
- projectId : ${sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID")}
- location : ${sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION")}
- inputBucketName : ${projectId + "-input-files"}
- outputBucketName : ${projectId + "-output-files-" + string(int(sys.now()))}
- createOutputBucket :
call : googleapis.storage.v1.buckets.insert
args :
project : ${projectId}
body :
name : ${outputBucketName}
- batchTranslateText :
call : googleapis.translate.v3beta1.projects.locations.batchTranslateText
args :
parent : ${"projects/" + projectId + "/locations/" + location}
body :
inputConfigs :
gcsSource :
inputUri : ${"gs://" + inputBucketName + "/*"}
outputConfig :
gcsDestination :
outputUriPrefix : ${"gs://" + outputBucketName + "/"}
sourceLanguageCode : "en"
targetLanguageCodes : [ "es" , "fr" ]
result : batchTranslateTextResult
The workflow assigns variables, creates an output bucket, and initiates the
translation of the files, saving the results to the output bucket.
After creating the workflow, deploy it:
gcloud workflows deploy batch-translation --source = workflow.yaml
Execute the workflow:
gcloud workflows execute batch-translation
To view the workflow status, you can run the returned command. For example:
gcloud workflows executions describe eb4a6239-cffa-4672-81d8-d4caef7d8424 /
--workflow batch-translation /
--location us-central1
The workflow should be ACTIVE . After a few minutes, the
translated files (in French and Spanish) are uploaded to the output bucket.
List objects in the output bucket
You can confirm that the workflow worked as expected by listing the objects in
your output bucket.
Retrieve your output bucket name:
gcloud storage ls
The output is similar to the following:
gs:// PROJECT_ID -input-files/
gs:// PROJECT_ID -output-files- TIMESTAMP /
List the objects in your output bucket:
gcloud storage ls gs:// PROJECT_ID -output-files- TIMESTAMP /** --recursive
After a few minutes, the translated files, two of each in French and Spanish,
are listed.
Clean up
If you created a new project for this tutorial, delete the project .
If you used an existing project and wish to keep it without the changes added
in this tutorial, delete resources created for the tutorial .
Delete the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Delete tutorial resources
Remove the gcloud default configuration you added during the tutorial setup:
gcloud config unset workflows/location
Delete the workflow created in this tutorial:
gcloud workflows delete WORKFLOW_NAME
Delete a bucket and its objects created in this tutorial:
gcloud storage rm gs:// BUCKET_NAME --recursive
Where BUCKET_NAME is the name of the bucket to
delete. For example, my-bucket .
The response is similar to the following:
Removing gs://my-bucket/...
Note: If you have to delete a large number of objects in your buckets, avoid
using the gcloud CLI, as the operation takes a long time to
complete. Instead, use the Google Cloud console or
Object Lifecycle Management .
