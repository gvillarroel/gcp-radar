Gemini for Google Cloud
Guides
Send feedback
View Gemini for Google Cloud logs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes how you can enable the collection and storage of
Gemini for Google Cloud activity, including the following:
Gemini for Google Cloud prompts and response logs, such as
user input, contextual information, and responses.
Gemini for Google Cloud metadata logs, such as telemetry
metadata and lines of code accepted by the user.
If you need to generate Gemini Code Assist metrics, see
Monitor Gemini for Google Cloud usage .
Gemini for Google Cloud doesn't collect or send to
Cloud Logging any other user interactions the user might have had with
Gemini for Google Cloud, including written feedback. The
collected data is sent to Cloud Logging for storage. You can review this data
by searching for log entries with the resource type
cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/Instance .
Note: Google doesn't use prompts or responses as data to train its model,
whether or not Gemini for Google Cloud logging is enabled.
When Gemini for Google Cloud logging is enabled, Google
does log the data for use by your organization's system administrators.
This feature does not log prompts or responses within Gemini
in Vertex AI. To enable logs for Gemini
in Vertex AI, see
Enable Data Access audit logs .
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles control the ability for a principal to access
logs. You can grant predefined roles to principals, or you can create custom
roles. For more information about required permissions, see
Access control .
By default, Cloud Logging
encrypts customer content stored at rest .
Data stored in log buckets by Logging is encrypted
using key-encryption keys,
a process known as envelope encryption .
Access to your logging data requires access to those key-encryption keys, which
Google manages for you without any actions on your part.
Your organization might have regulatory, compliance-related, or advanced
encryption requirements that our default encryption at rest doesn't provide.
To meet your organization's requirements, instead of Google managing the
encryption keys that protect your data, you can manage your keys.
For specific information about customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) usage,
including advantages, and limitations, see Customer-managed encryption keys .
Limitations
Gemini in Google Cloud log data recording is limited to
user interactions with Gemini Code Assist within an IDE.
By default, Gemini for Google Cloud logs are collected on
a per-project basis. For instructions on how to configure a centralized
project to collect logs from multiple projects, see
Set up multi-project logging .
Gemini Code Assist on GitHub
doesn't support logging with Cloud Logging.
Before you begin
To get the permissions that
you need to
view Gemini for Google Cloud logs
,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer )
IAM role on your project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Review Cloud Logging pricing and
Gemini for Google Cloud pricing
before
enabling Gemini for Google Cloud logging .

Cloud AI Companion Instance .
gcloud
Run the following command:
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/Instance" --project PROJECT_ID --limit 3
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of the project whose
Gemini for Google Cloud logs you want to view.
API
Create a JSON file that contains the following information:
{
"resourceNames": [
"projects/ PROJECT_ID "
],
"pageSize": 5,
"filter": "resource.type: cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/Instance"
}
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of the project
whose Gemini for Google Cloud logs you want to
view.
Obtain an authentication token :
TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)
Use cURL to call the
entries.list method :
curl -X POST --data-binary @ JSON_FILE_NAME \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://logging.googleapis.com/v2/entries:list"
Replace JSON_FILE_NAME with the path for the
JSON file that you created in the preceding step.
For more information on authentication, see
Authenticate for using REST .
The response returns a set of log entries.
Gemini for Google Cloud logs
A LogEntry is the basic unit of
data in Cloud Logging. The following sections provide lists of fields found
in the LogEntry for a Gemini for Google Cloud platform event, such as
user requests and Gemini for Google Cloud responses .
User requests
The following table shows a list of fields found in a user request log entry:

GenerateCode : for example, a request to generate code, such as with a code transformation request within Gemini Code Assist. CompleteCode : for example, a request to complete code when working in the IDE, such as with inline suggestions within Gemini Code Assist.
LogEntry.labels.product
Gemini for Google Cloud service name. If the Gemini for Google Cloud product is Gemini Code Assist, then this value is code_assist . If the Gemini for Google Cloud product is Gemini Cloud Assist, then this value is cloud_assist . Otherwise, this value is unknown .
LogEntry.labels.request_id
A unique identifier to correlate a request to a response log entry.
LogEntry.labels.user_id
The identifier of the user that initiated this request.
LogEntry.jsonPayload
The payload of the log entry.
LogEntry.logName
Identifies the log.
The following sample shows an example log entry for a chat prompt event:

Agent interaction logs
Some interactions with Gemini can generate multiple log entries
(request, response, and metadata) for a single user action. Examples of such
interactions include the following:
An agent performing a task that involves tool use (for instance, the model
invoking internal functions like read_file or replace , as shown in the log
examples).
An agent interacting with other agents.

Calculate acceptance rate
The following sections describe how to calculate the code suggestion
acceptance rate, the chat response acceptance rate, and the total
combined acceptance rate using Gemini Code Assist
metadata logs.
Calculate code acceptance rate
To calculate the code acceptance rate using Gemini Code Assist
metadata logs, find the total number of unique IDs from events with
codeAcceptance.originalRequestId and divide it by the total number of unique
IDs from events with codeExposure.originalRequestId .
You can further refine this calculation by programming language and by user
using the respective metadata log event fields.
Calculate chat acceptance rate
To calculate the chat acceptance rate using Gemini Code Assist
metadata logs, find the total number of unique IDs from events with
chatAcceptance.originalRequestId and divide it by the total number of unique
IDs from events with chatExposure.originalRequestId .
You can further refine this calculation by programming language and by user
using the respective metadata log event fields.
Calculate total acceptance rate
To calculate the total acceptance rate using Gemini Code Assist
metadata logs, find the total number of accepted events and divide that by the
total number of exposure events:
Total acceptance rate = Total accepted events ÷ Total exposure events
Total accepted events : the total number of unique IDs from events with
codeAcceptance.originalRequestId plus the total number of unique IDs from
events with chatAcceptance.originalRequestId .
Total exposure events : the total number of unique IDs from events with
codeExposure.originalRequestId plus the total number of unique IDs from
events with chatExposure.originalRequestId .
This formula provides an acceptance rate that reflects the overall
probability of any suggestion being accepted across all
Gemini Code Assist features.
Calculate lines of code accepted
The following sections describe how to calculate the number of lines of code
accepted from code suggestions, the number of lines of code accepted
from chat, and the total lines of code accepted using
Gemini Code Assist metadata logs.
Calculate lines of code accepted
To calculate lines of code accepted, find the maximum value for
codeAcceptance.linesCount for each unique codeAcceptance.originalRequestId .
Then, sum these maximum values to calculate the total lines of code accepted.
You can further refine this calculation by programming language and by user
using the respective metadata log event fields.
Calculate lines of code accepted from chat
To calculate lines of code accepted from chat, find the value of the
chatAcceptance.linesCount field for each unique
chatAcceptance.originalRequestId . Then, sum these maximum values to calculate
the total lines of chat accepted.
Calculate total lines of code accepted
To calculate the total lines accepted using Gemini Code Assist
metadata logs, add the lines of code accepted and
lines of code accepted from chat .
