Security, privacy, and compliance for Gemini in BigQuery
This document describes the controls that support the security of
Gemini in BigQuery. These controls can also help
you meet the privacy and regulatory requirements that apply to your business.
Gemini in BigQuery is built on Google Cloud
infrastructure. Your data remains in your control. For more information, see
Service Specific Terms .
The following controls apply to Generally Available (GA) Gemini
in BigQuery features:
Your data is not used for training models without your permission.
Google does not use your prompts, responses, or schema information to train
its models unless you explicitly opt in.
Your BigQuery data remains within your chosen location.
Gemini in BigQuery respects your
BigQuery data at rest data residency settings. The core
BigQuery engine that runs queries and stores your data
continues to honor your location constraints. For more information, see How Gemini in BigQuery processes data .
Gemini in BigQuery is covered by Google
security and compliance offerings. Coverage includes certifications like
SOC 1/2/3, ISO/IEC 27001, and
HIPAA compliance . For more information, see
Google security and compliance offerings .
The security, privacy, and compliance for Google Cloud services are a
shared responsibility .
Google secures the infrastructure that Google Cloud services run on, and it
provides you with tools such as access controls to let you manage who has access
to your services and resources. For more information about how the infrastructure is secured, see
Google infrastructure security design overview .
Because Gemini is an evolving technology, it can generate output
that's plausible-sounding but factually incorrect. We recommend that you
validate all output from Gemini before you use it. For more
information, see Gemini for Google Cloud and responsible
AI .
Gemini in BigQuery architecture
The following diagram shows the components of the Gemini in
BigQuery architecture.
Important: Gemini in BigQuery processes data in
the US or EU jurisdictions where the data resides. Data outside these
jurisdictions is processed globally. To learn more about where
Gemini in BigQuery processes your data, see
Where Gemini in BigQuery processes your data .
How Gemini in BigQuery processes data
When a user uses Gemini in BigQuery, a prompt and
its relevant context are sent to Google's large language models (LLMs) for
processing. Google manages the specific models used to generate
Gemini in BigQuery responses.
Prompt. A user enters a prompt as a natural language question, such
as "Show me the top 5 customers by sales last quarter". Or, a user types a
partial SQL or Python snippet in the Google Cloud console in
BigQuery Studio with Gemini in BigQuery
enabled.
Contextualization. Gemini in BigQuery
accesses the relevant metadata and schema of your BigQuery
tables to add context to the user's prompt. Contextual information can include
sampling data from tables and job histories. Gemini in
BigQuery only has access to the resources to which the user
has access.
Gemini processing. The prompt and contextual
information are sent to Gemini's LLMs for processing.
Gemini in BigQuery
doesn't retain or store contextual information. Gemini in
BigQuery uses the existing BigQuery context
that is stored in Knowledge Catalog and Spanner.
This information resides in the same location as your data.
Gemini generates a response, such as a SQL query, a data
insight, or a Python code snippet.
Response. The response is returned to the BigQuery
interface. The user can then run the generated code, modify it, or continue
to iterate on the response by using Gemini. You can provide
feedback from Gemini in BigQuery in the
Google Cloud console. To learn more about providing feedback, see Provide feedback .
Security controls
Gemini in BigQuery uses the security controls of
Google Cloud to help protect your data and resources. These controls
include the following:
Authentication. Users authenticate by using their
Google Cloud credentials, which can be integrated with your existing
identity provider.
Access controls. You can use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control
who has access to Gemini in BigQuery and what
actions they can perform.
Network security and VPC-SC. Gemini in
BigQuery traffic is encrypted in transit and at rest. You
can also use
VPC Service Controls to
create a security-enhanced perimeter around your
BigQuery resources.
Data protection and privacy
Gemini in BigQuery is designed to protect the
privacy of your data. Google's privacy policies and commitments apply to all
data processed by Gemini in BigQuery.
Data encryption. Your data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
Data access. Google personnel have limited and audited access to
your data.
Data residency. Your BigQuery data-at-rest
is stored and processed in the Google Cloud region you select.
Certifications and capabilities
Generally available (GA) Gemini in BigQuery
features are covered by the certifications and security statements of
Gemini for Google Cloud with exception of the
following limitations:
Gemini in BigQuery doesn't provide data
residency for individual locations. Gemini processing can be
specified for data with the US - and EU -supported jurisdictions. Data
outside these jurisdictions is processed globally. To learn more, see
Where Gemini in BigQuery processes your
data .
Cloud logging audit logs are not available for Gemini in
BigQuery user prompts and responses.
Gemini in BigQuery is not included in
supported Assured Workload packages .
To learn more about certifications and security for Gemini for
Google Cloud, see
certifications and security for Gemini for
Google Cloud .
Secure and responsible use
You should adhere to the following best practices to help ensure the secure and
responsible use of Gemini in BigQuery:
Use IAM to give the least privilege necessary. For
information about security best practices in BigQuery, see
Introduction to security and access controls in
BigQuery .
Be mindful of the data you include in your natural language prompts in
BigQuery, such as sensitive or personal information.
Review and validate the responses generated by Gemini in
BigQuery. Always treat AI-generated code and analysis as
suggestions that require human review.
Only enable Gemini in BigQuery for
projects that don't require compliance offerings other than those listed
previously and by
Gemini for Google Cloud .

Gemini in BigQuery, see
Turn off Gemini in BigQuery .
