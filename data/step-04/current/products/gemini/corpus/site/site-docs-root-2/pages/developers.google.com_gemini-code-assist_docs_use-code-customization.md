Gemini Code Assist code customization, available only in Gemini Code Assist Enterprise, provides code recommendations based on your organization's internal libraries, private APIs, and coding style.
Before using code customization, you need to set up Gemini Code Assist with an Enterprise subscription and configure code customization.
Code customization can be used through natural language chat, generating or transforming code in the IDE, and automatic autocomplete suggestions.
You can enhance the relevance of suggestions by using the @ symbol in chat to select specific remote repositories for context.
Best practices for using code customization include using relevant variable and function names, indexing appropriate repositories, and executing one action per prompt.
Note: Gemini Code Assist code customization is available only in
Gemini Code Assist Enterprise. For more information, see
Gemini Code Assist supported features .
This document describes how to use
Gemini Code Assist code customization
and provides a few best practices. This feature lets you receive code
recommendations, which draw from the internal libraries, private APIs, and the
coding style of your organization.

How to use code customization
The following table lists ways to use
Gemini Code Assist code customization:
Form
How to trigger
Notes and resources
Natural language chat
Enter a natural language prompt in Gemini Code Assist
chat in the IDE.
Consider the following:
Chat history is not available. Avoid multi-step queries.
You can ask for more details about sources, including links to
the specific sources.
If you highlight or select code when you send a message in chat,
Gemini Code Assist uses that code to improve code
customization and chat quality.
For more information, see
Chat with Gemini Code Assist .
Generate code
In the quick pick bar in your IDE, either with or without
selected code, press Command+Enter (on macOS) or
Control+Enter .
For more information, see
Generate code with prompts .
Transform code
In the quick pick bar in your IDE, either with or without
selected code, enter /fix .
For more information, see
Generate code with prompts .
Autocomplete
Code customization is automatically triggered and provides
suggestions based on what you write.
Consider the following:
Code completion needs a certain level of confidence to propose a
suggestion. Ensure that a substantial amount of code is available
so that relevant snippets are retrieved.
Code completion checks if you have required libraries in order
to use certain elements of the function.
For more information, see
Get code completions .
Remote repository context
Start your prompt with the @ symbol. A list of available remote
repositories that are indexed appears.
Select the repository you want to use for context from the list.
You can also start typing the repository name to filter the list.
After selecting the repository, write the rest of your prompt.
Remote repository context is useful when you are working on a task
that is mostly related to a specific set of microservices, libraries,
or modules.
For more information, see
Get more relevant suggestions with remote repository context .
Use cases and prompt examples
The following table provides guidance and examples about using
code customization in specific use cases:
Use case
Things worth trying
Writing new code
Try the following to generate code in your IDE or
Gemini Code Assist chat:
Generate code that would use terms which are already mentioned
in your codebase.
Paste in your code, such as a functional signature or code with
TODO comments, and then ask
Gemini Code Assist to fill in or replace
TODO comments with code. Add comments with explanation
from context.
Try generating code with the following prompts in
Gemini Code Assist chat:
"Write a main function where a connection to
DATABASE is created. Include health
checks."
"Write a FUNCTION_OR_CLASS in the
following structure:
EXPLAIN_STRUCTURE ."
After you generate some code, try using a follow-up prompt to
improve it:
"Try the /fix command to adjust the generated
code—for example, syntax errors."
"Add missing imports."
"Try /fix on chat-generated code."
Cleaning, simplifying, and refactoring code
Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist
chat:
"Can you merge
IMPORTS_VARIABLES_OR_NOTE_EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS
in this file?"
"How would you simplify the
FUNCTION_NAME function?"
"Can you merge FUNCTION_NAME_1 and
FUNCTION_NAME_2 into one function?"
"Could you inline some variables in
FUNCTION_NAME ?"
"Could you simplify variable naming in the function
FUNCTION_NAME ?"
Readability
Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist
chat:
"Write the function FUNCTION_NAME in
fewer lines of code, if possible."
"Add comments to the function
FUNCTION_NAME ."
"Remove unnecessary whitespaces in the function
FUNCTION_NAME ."
"Format the function FUNCTION_NAME in a
similar way as the rest of the code."
Code review
Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist
chat:
"Split the code in parts and explain each part using our
codebase."
"Are there variables or keywords that could be shorter and more
self-explanatory?"
"Can you give me useful code from the
REPOSITORY_NAME_PACKAGE_MODULE context for
this code?"
"What do you think about the function
FUNCTION_NAME ?"
Debugging
Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist
chat:
"I am getting an error when I try to do X/add Y. Why?"
"Can you spot an error in the function
FUNCTION_NAME ?"
"How would you fix the function
FUNCTION_NAME given this error
message?"
Learning and onboarding
Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist
chat:
"Split this code in parts and explain each of them using our
codebase."
"Show how to call function
FUNCTION_NAME ?"
"Show how to run the main function in the
ENVIRONMENT_NAME environment?"
"What is the key technical improvement we can do to make this
code more performant?"
"Show me the implementation of
FUNCTION_OR_CLASS_NAME to achieve better
results and add what that specific element is"—for example,
"Show me the implementation of function foo where foo is the name of
the function."
Migration
Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist
chat:
"Give me a strategy for how I can migrate
FILE_NAME from
LANGUAGE_1 to
LANGUAGE_2 "—for example, from Go to
Python.
"Given the function FUNCTION_NAME in
repository REPOSITORY_NAME , find me an
equivalent function in language
LANGUAGE_NAME that I can use."
Try the following chat-based or code generation transformation
workflow using prompts:
"Take FILENAME_COMPONENT code
already written in LANGUAGE_1 and refactor
and migrate it to LANGUAGE_2 "—for example,
from Go to Python.
After you migrate some code, try the following:
Select smaller chunks and use /fix to get
it into a state that you want.
Try the following prompts:
"Is there something which can be improved?"
"Give me possible pain points."
"How would you test this code if that migration is
correct?"
Generating documentation
Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist
chat:
"Summarize the code in package or folder
X and provide documentation for the top five
important methods."
"Generate documentation for
FUNCTION_OR_CLASS_NAME ."
"Shorten the documentation while preserving the key
information."
Unit test generation
Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist
chat:
"Generate unit tests for FILENAME ."
"Add the most relevant test cases for the
FUNCTION_NAME function."
"Remove test cases that you think don't bring much value."
Best practices
Use relevant variable and function names or code snippets. This guides
code customization towards the most pertinent code examples.
Use index repositories that you want to scale, and avoid adding deprecated
functionality. Code customization helps to scale to the code style,
patterns, code semantics, knowledge, and implementations across the codebase.
Bad examples of repositories to scale are deprecated functionalities,
generated code, and legacy implementations.
For code retrieval use cases, use code generation functionality instead of
code completion . Prompt using language such as "Using the definition of
FUNCTION_NAME , generate the exact same function," or
"Generate the exact implementation of FUNCTION_NAME ."
Have includes or imports present in the file for the code that you want to
retrieve to improve Gemini contextual awareness.
Execute only one action for each prompt. For example, if you want to
retrieve code and have this code be implemented in a new function, perform
these steps over two prompts.
For use cases where you want more than just code (such as code
explanation, migration plan, or error explanation), use
code customization for chat, where you have a conversation with
Gemini with your codebase in context.
Note that AI model generation is non-deterministic . If you aren't
satisfied with the response, executing the same prompt again might achieve a
better result.
Note that generating unit tests generally works better if you open the
file locally, and then from chat, ask to generate unit tests for this file or
a specific function.
Get more relevant suggestions with remote repository context
You can get more contextually aware and relevant code suggestions by directing Gemini Code Assist to focus on specific remote repositories. By using the @ symbol in the chat, you can select one or more repositories to be used as a primary source of context for your prompts. This is useful when you are working on a task that is mostly related to a specific set of microservices, libraries, or modules.
To use a remote repository as context, follow these steps in your IDE's chat:
Start your prompt with the @ symbol. A list of available remote repositories that are indexed will appear.
Select the repository you want to use for context from the list. You can also start typing the repository name to filter the list.
After selecting the repository, write the rest of your prompt.
Gemini will then prioritize the selected repository when generating a response.
Example Prompts
Here are some examples of how you can use this feature:
To understand a repository:
" @ REPOSITORY_NAME What is the overall structure of this repository?"
" @ REPOSITORY_NAME I'm a new team member. Can you give me an overview of this repository's purpose and key modules?"
For code generation and modification:
" @ REPOSITORY_NAME Implement an authentication function similar to the one in this repository."
" @ REPOSITORY_NAME Refactor the following code to follow the conventions in the selected repository."
" @ REPOSITORY_A_NAME How can I use the latest functions from this repository to improve my code in REPOSITORY_B_NAME ?"
For testing:
" @ UNIT_TEST_FILE_NAME Generate unit tests for MODULE based on the examples in the selected file."
By using remote repositories as a focused source of context, you can get more accurate and relevant suggestions from Gemini Code Assist, which can help you code faster and more efficiently.
