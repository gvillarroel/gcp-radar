Gemini Code Assist on GitHub is a Gemini-powered agent that summarizes pull requests and provides code reviews.
You need a GitHub account and one or more repositories to set up Gemini Code Assist on GitHub.
Setting up Gemini Code Assist on GitHub involves installing the app and selecting repositories, with different steps for consumer and enterprise versions.
For the enterprise version, specific IAM roles may be required for setup within Google Cloud.
This page shows you how to set up
Gemini Code Assist on GitHub ,
a Gemini-powered agent that automatically summarizes pull
requests and provides in-depth code reviews.
Before you begin
To set up Gemini Code Assist on GitHub, make sure you
do the following:
Consumer
Have a GitHub organization or personal account.
Note: The consumer version of Gemini Code Assist on
GitHub doesn't support organizations that enable private
connectivity.

Gemini Code Assist on GitHub on.
If you don't have such a repository, you can create a fork of
our sample repository
to use.
Enterprise
Have a GitHub organization or personal account.
