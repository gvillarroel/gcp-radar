Upload conversation data
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Conversation data is accepted as transcripts (Smart Reply) and transcripts plus
annotation data (Summarization). In order
to use Smart Reply and Summarization during runtime you must provide your own
conversation data.
This page guides you through the steps required to use the public datasets as
well as to format your own data for upload to Cloud Storage. You must provide
your conversation data as JSON-formatted text files .
Smart Reply data format
Smart Reply can be used in conjunction with any Agent Assist feature,
or as a stand-alone feature. In order to implement Smart Reply, you must
provide Agent Assist with conversation data.
Summarization data format
Summarization can be used in conjunction with any Agent Assist feature,
or as a stand-alone feature. In order to implement Summarization, you must
provide Agent Assist with conversation data that includes annotations .
An annotation is a summary of an associated conversation transcript. Annotations
are used to train a model that you can use to generate summaries for your agents
at the end of each conversation with an end-user.
Format annotations
Agent Assist Summarization custom models are trained using conversation
datasets . A conversation dataset contains your own uploaded transcript and
annotation data.
Before you can begin uploading data, you must make sure that that each
conversation transcript is in
JSON format ,
has an associated annotation, and is stored in a
Google Cloud Storage bucket .
To create annotations, add expected key and value strings to the
annotation field associated with each conversation in your dataset. For best
results, annotation training data should adhere to the following guidelines:
The recommended minimum number of training annotations is 1000. The enforced
minimum number is 100.
Training data should not contain PII.
Annotations should not include any information about gender, race or age.
Annotations should not use toxic or profane language.
Annotations should not contain any information that can't be inferred from
the corresponding conversation transcript.
Each annotation can contain up to 3 sections. You can choose your own section
names.
Annotations should have correct spelling and grammar.
The following is an example demonstrating the format of a conversation
transcript with associated annotation:
{
"entries": [
{
"text": "How can I help?",
"role": "AGENT"
},
{
"text": "I cannot login",
"role": "CUSTOMER"
},
{
"text": "Ok, let me confirm. Are you experiencing issues accessing your account",
"role": "AGENT"
},
{
"text": "Yes",
"role": "CUSTOMER"
},
{
"text": "Got it. Do you still have access to the registered email for the account",
"role": "AGENT"
},
{
"text": "Yes",
"role": "AGENT"
},
{
"text": "I have sent an email with reset steps. You can follow the instructions in the email to reset your login password",
"role": "AGENT"
},
{
"text": "That's nice",
"role": "CUSTOMER"
},
{
"text": "Is there anything else I can help",
"role": "AGENT"
},
{
"text": "No that's all",
"role": "CUSTOMER"
},
{
"text": "Thanks for calling. You have a nice day",
"role": "AGENT"
}

},

}

"entries": [
{
"start_timestamp_usec": 1000000,
"text": "Hello, I'm calling in regards to ...",
"role": "CUSTOMER",
"user_id": 1
},
{
"start_timestamp_usec": 5000000,
"text": "Yes, I can answer your question ...",
"role": "AGENT",
"user_id": 2
},
...
]
}
Upload conversations to Cloud Storage
You must provide your conversation data in a Cloud Storage bucket
contained within your Google Cloud Platform project.
When creating the bucket:
Be sure that you have selected the Google Cloud Platform project you use for
Dialogflow.
Use the Standard Storage class .
Set the bucket location to a location nearest to
your location.
You will need the location ID (for example, us-west1 ) when providing the
conversation data, so take note of your choice.
You will also need the bucket name when providing the conversation data.
Follow the Cloud storage quickstart
instructions to create a bucket and upload files.
