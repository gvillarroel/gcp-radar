Article Suggestion
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Caution: Article suggestion will be deprecated on April 1, 2026. As of August 21, 2025 you can no longer create new conversation profiles for this feature, and existing profiles will be removed on or after April 1, 2026. For an alternative, use generative knowledge assist .
The Agent Assist Article Suggestion feature follows a conversation between
a human agent and an end-user and provides the human agent with relevant
document suggestions. A human agent can examine these suggestions while the
conversation proceeds and make a decision about which documents to read or to
share with the end-user. You can use Article Suggestion to help a human agent
understand and resolve end-user issues while the human agent and end-user are in
a conversation.
Agent Assist provides baseline Article Suggestion models that you can use
to suggest articles to your agents. Optionally, you can train a custom model
using your own uploaded conversation data to improve performance. If you want to
train a custom suggestion model for use with Article Suggestion, contact your
Google representative.
This document walks you through the process of using the API to implement
Article Suggestion and get suggestions from this feature during runtime. You
have the option of using the
Agent Assist Console
to test your Article Suggestion results during design-time, but you must call
the API directly during runtime. See the tutorials
section for details about testing feature
performance using the Agent Assist Console.
Before you begin
Complete the following before starting this guide:
Enable the Dialogflow API for your
Google Cloud project.
Configure a conversation profile
In order to get suggestions from Agent Assist you must create a knowledge
base containing your uploaded documents
and configure a conversation
profile . You can also perform
these actions using the Agent Assist Console if
you would prefer not to call the API directly.
Create a knowledge base
Before you can begin uploading documents you must first create a knowledge base
to put them in. To create a knowledge base, call the create method on the
KnowledgeBase
type.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your GCP project ID
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_DISPLAY_NAME : desired knowledge base name
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /knowledgeBases
Request JSON body:
{
"displayName": " KNOWLEDGE_BASE_DISPLAY_NAME "
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /knowledgeBases"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /knowledgeBases" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /knowledgeBases/ NDA4MTM4NzE2MjMwNDUxMjAwMA ",
"displayName": " KNOWLEDGE_BASE_DISPLAY_NAME "
}
The path segment after knowledgeBases contains your new knowledge base ID.

)
print ( "Knowledge Base created: \n " )
print ( "Display Name: {} \n " . format ( response . display_name ))
print ( "Name: {} \n " . format ( response . name ))
Create a knowledge document
You can now add documents to the knowledge base. To create a document in the
knowledge base, call the create method on the Document
type .
Set
KnowledgeType
to ARTICLE_SUGGESTION . This example uses an HTML file with return order
information
that was uploaded to a publicly shared
Cloud Storage bucket. When you set
up Article Suggestion in your own system, documents must be in one of the
following formats. See the knowledge documents
documentation for more information
about document best practices.
Knowledge document formats:
A file stored in a Cloud Storage bucket. You can specify the path when
you call the API.
The text contents of a document, which you can send in an API request.
A public URL.
Note: When you create a knowledge document, it can take up to one day before
the document is available for suggestions.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your GCP project ID
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID : your knowledge base ID returned from previous request

Create a conversation profile
A conversation profile configures a set of parameters that control the
suggestions made to an agent during a conversation. The following steps create a
ConversationProfile
with a
HumanAgentAssistantConfig
object. You can also perform these actions using the Agent Assist
Console if you would prefer not to
call the API directly.
We recommend that you set an initial confidence threshold of 0.44 (0.1 if you
are using the legacy baseline model). You can increase the threshold beyond the
recommended range if necessary. Increasing the threshold results in higher
accuracy and lower coverage results (fewer suggestions); decreasing the
threshold results in lower accuracy and higher coverage (more suggestions).
Inline suggestions are enabled by default. Optionally, you can enable Cloud
Pub/Sub notifications when you configure
the conversation profile.
REST
To create a conversation profile, call the create method on the
ConversationProfile
resource.
noSmallTalk : If true , suggestions will not be triggered after small talk
messages (such as "hi", "how are you", and so on). If false , suggestions will
be triggered after small talk messages.
onlyEndUser : If true , suggestions will be triggered only after end-user
messages. If false , suggestions will be triggered after both end-user and
human agent messages.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your GCP project ID
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID : your knowledge base ID

(Optional) Set security settings
You have the option of setting security parameters to address issues such as
data redaction and data retention. To do this, you must create a
SecuritySettings
resource, then link it to a conversation profile using the securitySettings
field .
Security settings added to a conversation profile affect the behavior of
Agent Assist text messages only . The behavior of the Dialogflow
interaction history is controlled by Dialogflow's security
settings , which you can set
using the Dialogflow CX console .
Handle conversations at runtime
Create a conversation
When a dialog begins between an end-user and a human or virtual agent, you
create a conversation . In order to see suggestions, you must also create
both an end-user participant and a human agent participant and add them to the
conversation . The following sections walk you through this process.

Add and analyze a message from the human agent
Each time either participant types a message in the conversation, you need to
send that message to the API for processing. Agent Assist bases its
suggestions on analysis of human agent and end-user messages. In the following
example, the human agent starts the conversation by asking "How may I help
you?". No suggestions are returned yet in the response.
REST
To add and analyze a human agent message in the conversation, call the
analyzeContent method on the
Participant
resource.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your GCP project ID
CONVERSATION_ID : your conversation ID
PARTICIPANT_ID : your human agent participant ID
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /conversations/ CONVERSATION_ID /participants/ PARTICIPANT_ID :analyzeContent
Request JSON body:
{
"textInput": {
"text": "How may I help you?",
"languageCode": "en-US"
}
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /conversations/ CONVERSATION_ID /participants/ PARTICIPANT_ID :analyzeContent"

return response
Add a message from the end-user and get suggestions
In response to the human agent, the end-user says "I want to return my order."
This time, the API response contains a suggested document with its associated
confidence score. Earlier in this tutorial we added one knowledge document to
the knowledge
base , and
that document was returned. Confidence scores range from 0 to 1; higher values
indicate a higher likelihood that the document is relevant to the conversation.
A snippet containing the first 100 characters of the document is also returned.
The snippet can help a human agent quickly determine whether the document is
useful. We recommend that you provide this information to your human agent, who
might choose to share the recommended document with the end-user.
Note: When you integrate Article Suggestion, be aware that human agents can't
click a document and see it unless you implement this capability in your own
system.

API request options
The previous sections show how to create a
ConversationProfile
in order to receive suggestions. The following sections outline some optional
functionalities that you can implement during a conversation.
Pub/Sub suggestion notifications
In the sections earlier, the
ConversationProfile
was created with only a human agent assistant. During the conversation you
needed to call the API to receive suggestions after each message was added to
the conversation. If you prefer to receive notification events for suggestions,
you can set the notificationConfig field when creating the conversation
profile. This option uses Cloud Pub/Sub to send suggestion
notifications to your application as the conversation proceeds and new
suggestions are available.
