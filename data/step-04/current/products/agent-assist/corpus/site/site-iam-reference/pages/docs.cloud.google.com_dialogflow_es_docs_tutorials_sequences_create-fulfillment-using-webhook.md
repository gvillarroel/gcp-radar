Create fulfillment using webhook
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Webhook fulfillment in Dialogflow gives us a lot of control over the flow of
our agent. In this tutorial, you need a webhook to validate the alphanumeric
sequences collected in the "Sequence" intent. The webhook will loop that
intent repeatedly to collect a long sequence in more manageable iterations.
Create a webhook with the inline editor
Dialogflow has an inline editor in the console that allows you to directly write
NodeJS code, which then can be deployed to run as a webhook on Cloud Functions .
To create a webhook using Dialogflow's inline editor, follow these steps:
Click the Fulfillment tab on the navigation bar to go to the fulfillment page.
Toggle the inline editor's button to ENABLED.
Delete the existing content in the package.json tab of the inline editor.
Copy and paste the JSON content below to the package.json tab of the inline editor:
{
"name": "DialogflowFirebaseWebhook",
"description": "Firebase Webhook dependencies for a Dialogflow agent.",
"version": "0.0.1",
"private": true,
"license": "Apache Version 2.0",
"author": "Google Inc.",
"engines": {
"node": "10"
},
"scripts": {
"lint": "semistandard --fix \"**/*.js\"",

"deploy": "firebase deploy --only functions"
},
"dependencies": {
"firebase-functions": "^2.0.2",
"firebase-admin": "^5.13.1"
}
}
Delete the existing code in the index.js tab of the inline editor.
Copy and paste the code below to the index.js tab of the inline editor:

Click DEPLOY .
You should now be able to test the integration by calling the agent. If you
haven't already, now would be a good time to set up one of the one-click
telephony integrations from our partners, or
set up the Dialogflow Phone Gateway to test your agent over the phone.
Understanding the code
As the entrypoint to the webhook, the dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment function
here is called everytime webhook is triggered. With each request, Dialogflow sends
the "action" name you specified in the Dialogflow console for an intent. The code
uses this action name to determine what webhook function to call,
handleSequence or validateSequence .
Handle Sequence
handleSequence is the core function for this tutorial. It is responsible for all aspects
of the sequence slot-filling including:
Speaking the initial instructions when a session first enters the intent.
Repeating the sequence back before prompting for the next set.
Telling end-users how to correct the bot.
Recognizing when there are enough digits for a valid sequence and telling the
end-user how to finalize the input (see `MIN_SEQUENCE_LENGTH' in the code).
Looping the slot-filling to collect multiple partial sequences.
Concatenating the partial sequences together into one long sequence.
Validate Sequence
validateSequence is where you'll want to add a connection to your data store
to validate the final sequence and return a custom message to the user based on
that data. If you are building an order lookup agent, for example, you might
customize the response here to say:
Thank you. Your order ${verbatim} will arrive on ${lookup.date} and will
${lookup.require_signature ? '' : 'not'} require a signature.
Where lookup is some object you found in your data store for this order.
Helper functions
This example does not use any Dialogflow-specific dependencies. Instead, follow the
WebhookRequest reference
for what to expect in request.body , and the
WebhookResponse reference
for what to respond with response.json({...}) .
The code includes two helper functions to make it easier to:
Send the proper response JSON for the current platform by passing a
string to sendSSML .
Look for an active Dialogflow context from the request by passing the
context name to getOutputContext .
Further improvement
This should get you started on using webhook for advanced use-cases. You designed
an agent that can loop a sequence prompt while an end-user speaks their sequence,
reassuring along the way that the virtual agent is hearing them properly.
Here are some ideas for improving the experience even more:
Change some of the webhook responses to match your brand. For example, instead
of the generic "What is your sequence?..." prompt, you could edit the code to
say "What is your order number? You can find it on ..." instead.
Consider adding another output context to the "Sequence - Done" intent, then
create some new intents under that input context to allow users to ask
follow-up questions about their order.
If you want to dive further into this use-case, do check out the
TODO: CHALLENGE in the sample code above for how you might improve this
experience even further for your users.
