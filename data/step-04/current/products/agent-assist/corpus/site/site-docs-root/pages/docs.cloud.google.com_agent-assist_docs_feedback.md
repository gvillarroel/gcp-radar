Send feedback to Agent Assist
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This guide describes how to send feedback to Agent Assist about the
quality of a specific suggested answer. This information is used to improve
the quality of your suggested answers in the future.
Feedback types
Feedback falls into one of two categories. Information about both feedback
types is conveyed by fields in an
answerFeedback
object:
Implicit feedback: Whether or not an agent clicked on a suggested answer. This information is contained in the boolean clicked field.
Explicit feedback: The level of correctness of the answer or other detailed information about the answer, provided by the agent. Level of correctness is conveyed by the correctnessLevel field. Optionally, additional details can be added to the agentAssistDetailFeedback field as an AgentAssistantFeedback object.
Send feedback to Agent Assist
There is an Answers field in every Agent Assist response (for example, faqAnswers ,
articleAnswers , and
smartReplyAnswers ). To provide feedback about an answer, find the resource name of the answer record. The resource name has the format "projects/ project-id /answerRecords/ answer-record-id ". Use the answer record to call the UpdateAnswerRecord method to send AnswerFeedback
about the answer.
Generative knowledge assist
Generative knowledge assist can either answer agent questions or proactively suggest question and answer pairs. These two features require different JSON requests for sending feedback.
Use the answer record to call the
UpdateAnswerRecord
method to send
AnswerFeedback
to indicate possible feedback events:
displayed : Whether the suggestion is displayed to the human
agent.
clicked : Whether the suggestion is clicked by the human agent.
correctness_level : Whether the suggestion is correct or not. A typical use case is to provide thumbs up and thumbs down buttons for the human agent to provide feedback.
answer_copied : Whether the answer is copied by the human agent.
clicked_uris : The URIs clicked by the human agent.
Smart reply
Use the answer record to call the
UpdateAnswerRecord
method to send
AnswerFeedback
to indicate two feedback events:
displayed : a suggestion (identified by answer-record-id returned in
the Smart Reply suggestions) was displayed in the agent UI.
clicked : a suggestion (identified by answer-record-id returned in the
Smart Reply suggestions) was clicked by the agent.
The suggestion was displayed to the agent.

The suggestion was clicked by the agent.

Article suggestion and FAQ assist
The following sample demonstrates how to send direct feedback from an agent in
response to the agent being asked about suggestion correctness. The
correctnessLevel field can be one of FULLY_CORRECT , PARTIALLY_CORRECT ,
NOT_CORRECT , CORRECTNESS_LEVEL_UNSPECIFIED .
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: quota-project-id " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
"name": "projects/ project-id /answerRecords/ answer-record-id ",
"answerFeedback": {
"correctnessLevel": "FULLY_CORRECT",
"agentAssistantDetailFeedback": {},
"clicked": true
}
}' https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ project-id /answerRecords/ answer-record-id ?updateMask=answer_feedback
The following sample demonstrates how to send click-only indirect feedback:
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: quota-project-id " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
"name": "projects/ project-id /answerRecords/ answer-record-id ",
"answerFeedback": {
"clicked": true
}
}' https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ project-id /answerRecords/ answer-record-id ?updateMask=answer_feedback
Summarization
Summarization uses feedback to calculate the duration spent on reviewing or editing a summary and edit rate.
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: quota-project-id " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
"name": "projects/ project-id /answerRecords/ answer-record-id ",
"answerFeedback": {
"agentAssistantDetailFeedback": {
"summarizationFeedback": {
"startTimestamp": "2022-10-15T02:10:11.414Z",
"submitTimestamp": "2022-10-15T02:12:41.000012345Z",
"summaryText": "submitted summary"
}
}
}
}' \
https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2beta1/projects/ project-id /answerRecords/ answer-record-id ?updateMask=answer_feedback.agent_assistant_detail_feedback.summarization_feedback
Summarization feedback also supports updating summaries within each section. Note: Only one field should be updated at a time, either summarizationFeedback.summaryText or summarizationFeedback.textSections .
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: quota-project-id " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
"name": "projects/ project-id /answerRecords/ answer-record-id ",
"answerFeedback": {
"agentAssistantDetailFeedback": {
"summarizationFeedback": {
"startTimestamp": "2022-10-15T02:10:11.414Z",
"submitTimestamp": "2022-10-15T02:12:41.000012345Z",
"textSections": {
"section a": "section a summary",
"section b": "section b summary"
}
}
}
}
}' \
https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2beta1/projects/ project-id /answerRecords/ answer-record-id ?updateMask=answer_feedback.agent_assistant_detail_feedback.summarization_feedback
