This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Caution: FAQ assist will be deprecated on April 1, 2026. As of August 21, 2025 you can no longer create new conversation profiles for this feature, and existing profiles will be removed on or after April 1, 2026. For an alternative, use generative knowledge assist .
FAQ Assist suggests relevant FAQ answers to human agents during a conversation
with an end-user. This feature can be used to help a human agent answer common
end-user questions while the human agent and end-user are in a conversation.
Agent Assist follows the conversation and parses FAQ documents stored in
knowledge bases to suggest answers to
end-user questions. A human agent can examine these suggestions while the
conversation proceeds and make a decision about which suggestions to share with
the end-user.
This document walks you through the process of using the API to implement FAQ
Assist and get suggestions from this feature during runtime. You have the option
of using the
Agent Assist console
to test your Article Suggestion results during design-time, but you must call
the API directly during runtime. See the tutorials
section for details about testing feature
performance using the Agent Assist console.
Before you begin
Complete the following before starting this guide:
Enable the Dialogflow API for your
Google Cloud project.
Configure a conversation profile
In order to get suggestions from Agent Assist you must create a knowledge
base containing your uploaded documents
and configure a conversation
profile . You can also perform
these actions using the Agent Assist Console if
you would prefer not to call the API directly.
Create a knowledge base
Before you can begin uploading documents you must first create a knowledge base
to put them in. To create a knowledge base, call the create method on the
KnowledgeBase
type.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your GCP project ID
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_DISPLAY_NAME : desired knowledge base name
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /knowledgeBases
Request JSON body:
{
"displayName": " KNOWLEDGE_BASE_DISPLAY_NAME "
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /knowledgeBases"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /knowledgeBases" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /knowledgeBases/ NDA4MTM4NzE2MjMwNDUxMjAwMA ",
"displayName": " KNOWLEDGE_BASE_DISPLAY_NAME "
}
The path segment after knowledgeBases contains your new knowledge base ID.

)
print ( "Knowledge Base created: \n " )
print ( "Display Name: {} \n " . format ( response . display_name ))
print ( "Name: {} \n " . format ( response . name ))
Create a knowledge document
You can now add documents to the knowledge base. To create a document in the
knowledge base, call the create method on the Document
type .
Set
KnowledgeType
to FAQ . This example uses the Cloud Storage
FAQ document that was uploaded to a publicly shared Cloud
Storage bucket. When you set up Article
Suggestion in your own system, documents must be in one of the following
formats. See the knowledge documents
documentation for more information
about document best practices.
The FAQ document can be in one of three formats:
A public URL.
A Cloud Storage path to a csv file.
A csv file (that you will include in the API request).
If your document is in csv format, it must contain two columns: FAQ questions
must be listed in the first column, and the answers to each question must be
listed in the second column. Each FAQ question and its associated answer is
called an FAQ pair . Make sure that the csv file does not contain a header
row. If your document is a public URL, it must be an FAQ page listing multiple
FAQ pairs.
See the knowledge documents
documentation for best practices
information.
Note: When you create a knowledge document, it may take up to one day before
the document is available for suggestions.
REST
Before using any of the request data,

Create a conversation profile
A conversation profile configures a set of parameters that control the
suggestions made to an agent during a conversation. The following steps create a
ConversationProfile
with a
HumanAgentAssistantConfig
object. You can also perform these actions using the Agent Assist
Console if you would prefer not to call the API
directly.
Inline suggestions are enabled by default. Optionally, you can enable Cloud
Pub/Sub notifications when you configure
the conversation profile.
REST
To create a conversation profile, call the create method on the
ConversationProfile
resource.
noSmallTalk : If true , suggestions will not be triggered after small talk
messages (such as "hi", "how are you", and so on). If false , suggestions will
be triggered after small talk messages.
onlyEndUser : If true , suggestions will be triggered only after end-user
messages. If false , suggestions will be triggered after both end-user and
human agent messages.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:

(Optional) Set security settings
You have the option of setting security parameters to help address issues such
as data redaction and data retention. To do this, you must create a
SecuritySettings
resource, then link it to a conversation profile using the securitySettings
field .
Security settings added to a conversation profile affect the behavior of
Agent Assist text messages only . The behavior of the Dialogflow
interaction history is controlled by Dialogflow's security
settings , which you can set
using the Dialogflow CX console .
Handle conversations at runtime
Create a conversation
When a dialog begins between an end-user and a human or virtual agent, you
create a conversation . In order to see suggestions, you must also create
both an end-user participant and a human agent participant and add them to the
conversation . The following sections walk you through this process.

Add and analyze a message from the human agent
Each time either participant types a message in the conversation, you need to
send that message to the API for processing. Agent Assist bases its
suggestions on analysis of human agent and end-user messages. In the following
example, the human agent starts the conversation by asking "How may I help
you?". No suggestions are returned yet in the response.
REST
To add and analyze a human agent message for the conversation, call the
analyzeContent method on the
Participant
resource.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your GCP project ID
CONVERSATION_ID : your conversation ID
PARTICIPANT_ID : your human agent participant ID
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /conversations/ CONVERSATION_ID /participants/ PARTICIPANT_ID :analyzeContent
Request JSON body:
{
"textInput": {
"text": "How may I help you?",
"languageCode": "en-US"

, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running

Add a message from the end-user and get suggestions
In response to the agent, the end-user asks "How do I sign up?". The response
contains a list of suggested answers to the end-user's question as well as a
confidence score for each. All answers were drawn from the single FAQ knowledge
document that we added earlier in this
tutorial . The confidence
threshold refers to the model's level of confidence that each FAQ suggestion is
relevant to the agent's request. A higher confidence value increases the
likelihood of relevant responses being returned, but can result in fewer or no
responses returned if no available option meets the high threshold value. We
recommend a starting confidence score value of 0.4. You can adjust this value
later to improve your results if needed.
The response also includes the answer's source , the knowledge document that
the answer came from. You should provide the suggested answers to your human
agent, who might choose to provide this information to the end-user.

API request options
The previous sections show how to create a
ConversationProfile
in order to receive suggestions. The following sections outline some optional
functionalities that you can implement during a conversation.
Pub/Sub suggestion notifications
In the sections earlier, the
ConversationProfile
was created with only a human agent assistant. During the conversation you
needed to call the API to receive suggestions after each message was added to
the conversation. If you prefer to receive notification events for suggestions,
you can set the notificationConfig field when creating the conversation
profile. This option uses Cloud Pub/Sub to send suggestion
notifications to your application as the conversation proceeds and new
suggestions are available.
