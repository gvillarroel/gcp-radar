Integrate backend modules with your system
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Backend modules provide an infrastructure to process large volumes of feature-related messages and interact with the agent desktop UI. This tutorial walks you through the process of integrating backend modules with your agent system.
For more information about background modules concepts and structure, see the backend modules basics documentation.
Prerequisites
If you haven't configured it, install the Google Cloud CLI .
Create a Cloud Pub/Sub topic for each kind of event notification you need from Dialogflow. Note the topic ID and topic name for later backend deployment.
Configure your conversation profile using Agent Assist console with Pub/Sub topics.
Automated Deployment
The deployment can be automated by a Google Cloud automation script or terraform.
Automation Script
You can check ./deploy.sh for more details.
Apply terraform changes
You can automate the deployment with a gcloud CLI automation script or terraform. Before applying terraform changes complete the following steps.
Grant the following IAM roles to your account:
Project IAM Admin (roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin)
Service Usage Admin (roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin)
Service Account Admin (roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin)
Service Account User (roles/iam.serviceAccountUser)
Pub/Sub Admin (roles/pubsub.admin)
Secret Manager Admin (roles/secretmanager.admin)
Cloud Build Editor (roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor)
Artifact Registry Administrator (roles/artifactregistry.admin)
Storage Admin (roles/storage.admin)
Cloud Run Admin (roles/run.admin)
Cloud Memorystore Redis Admin (roles/redis.admin)
Serverless VPC Access Admin (roles/vpcaccess.admin)
Build images for UI Connector and for Cloud Pub/Sub Interceptor and note the image name.
For UI Connector, run the following command under ./ui-connector folder.
$ gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/ $GCP_PROJECT_ID /aa-integration-backend/ui-connector
For Cloud Pub/Sub Interceptor, run the following command under ./cloud-pubsub-interceptor folder.
$ gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/ $GCP_PROJECT_ID /aa-integration-backend/cloud-pubsub-interceptor
Create a Cloud Storage bucket to store terraform state and update the backend bucket value at /terraform/backend.tf using the following command.
GCP_PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get-value project )
# Create the Cloud storage bucket
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// ${ GCP_PROJECT_ID } -tfstate
# Enable Object Versioning to keep the history of your deployments
gcloud storage buckets update gs:// ${ GCP_PROJECT_ID } -tfstate --versioning
Export the value of required terraform variables gcp_project_id , ui_connector_docker_image and cloud_pubsub_interceptor_docker_image . Example: export TF_VAR_gcp_project_id='you-gcp-project-id'. Alternatively, you can fill their values at /terraform/variables.tf directly.
Customize the authentication method by modifying auth.check_auth() method at /ui-connector/auth.py .
If you want to automate these steps by using Cloud Build, follow this instruction and use the build configuration file ./terraform_cloudbuild.yaml . To allow Cloud Build to deploy the services, you need to grant Cloud Build Service Account the IAM roles listed at Step 1.
Manual deployment
Following steps explains how to deploy backend modules manually.
Set up environment variables
To make the commands for deployment simpler, we recommend that you set the following useful environment variables in your shell. You can set the variables using the following example command:
$ export GCP_PROJECT_ID = 'aa-integration-service'
Set the following environment variables:
GCP_PROJECT_ID : The project ID of your Cloud Platform project that hosts
related resources. Example: my-project .
SERVICE_REGION : The location or region of your services and related Google Cloud resources.
Platform resources. Example: us-central1 .
Set up an administrative account
We recommend using separate Google Cloud accounts for service
administration and runtime identity. Service administration is mainly performed
by humans with Google accounts , while
runtime identity grants Cloud Run services permissions using
service accounts to enable access to
necessary resources.
Prepare the human administrative account
If you plan to use an account that already has Editor or Owner permissions in
your project, you can skip ahead to the
next section .
To manage the backend infrastructure, establish an administrator account and grant it the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. Their permissions are all included in the Editor and Owner basic roles .
roles/secretmanager.admin (Secret Manager Admin): Manage secrets stored in
Secret Manager for JWT generation and verification.
roles/run.admin (Cloud Run Admin): Deploy and manage Cloud Run services.
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser (Service Account User): Grant Cloud Run runtime
service accounts iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permissions.
roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor (Cloud Build Editor): Build Docker images for
the integration services using Cloud Build.
Artifact Registry Administrator: Store and manage built Docker images for the
integration services.
roles/pubsub.editor (Cloud Pub/Sub Editor): Create and manage Cloud Pub/Sub
topics and subscriptions.
roles/redis.admin (Redis Admin): Create and manage Memorystore for Redis'
resources.
To grant IAM roles to a human account, use the
add-iam-policy-binding
Google Cloud CLI command. The following is an example command:
$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GCP_PROJECT_ID \
--member = 'user:test-user@gmail.com' \
--role = 'roles/pubsub.editor'
Set the human administrative account in gcloud
Replace $ADMIN_ACCOUNT with the administrator account you would like to use
(for example: myaccount@gmail.com ) in the following sample:
$ gcloud config set account $ADMIN_ACCOUNT
Set up service accounts
By default, Cloud Run services or jobs run as the
default Compute Engine service account .
Rather than leave the default, we recommend giving every Cloud Run service a dedicated identity by assigning it a user-managed service account with the
minimum required set of permissions. If you plan to keep the default service
account, you can skip ahead to
set environment variables .
Create two service accounts for each Cloud Run runtime
Note: You can also perform all of the actions in this section using the
Cloud Console UI .
To create the service accounts, replace the value of $CONNECTOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID and $INTERCEPTOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID if and run the following commands:
$ export CONNECTOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID = 'aa-ui-connector' && gcloud iam service-accounts create $CONNECTOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID \
--description = 'Agent Assist integration - UI connector service account' \
--display-name = 'Agent Assist integration - UI connector'
$ export INTERCEPTOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID = 'aa-pubsub-interceptor' && gcloud iam service-accounts create $INTERCEPTOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID \
--description = 'Agent Assist integration - Pubsub interceptor service account' \
--display-name = 'Agent Assist integration - Pubsub interceptor'
Use the following sample command to assign the following roles to the UI
connector and Cloud Pub/Sub connector service accounts:
$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GCP_PROJECT_ID \
--member = 'serviceAccount:$CONNECTOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID@$GCP_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--role = 'roles/pubsub.editor'
Grant the following IAM roles to the UI connector service account:
roles/redis.editor
roles/vpcaccess.user
roles/compute.viewer
roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
roles/dialogflow.agentAssistClient
Grant the following roles to the Cloud Pub/Sub connector service account:
roles/redis.editor
roles/vpcaccess.user
roles/compute.viewer
Set environment variables
Set the values of the following environment variables to be the service accounts
you just created or the
default Compute Engine service account
in your project.
CONNECTOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT : The service account for UI connector runtime.
Example: aa-ui-connector@my-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
INTERCEPTOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT : The service account for Cloud Pub/Sub
Interceptor runtime. Example: aa-pubsub-interceptor@my-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Customize the user authentication method
The code repository supports both backend users and users of the frontend module for Genesys Cloud and Twilio.
Within the code repository, open the ui_connector/auth.py file.
Specify the supported identity provider by setting the environment variable AUTH_OPTION or implement your authentication method with auth.check_auth .
By default, AUTH_OPTION is empty and no users are allowed to register JWT with the UI Connector service.
Supported values:
Salesforce : Verify the auth token using Salesforce OpenID Connect. Required environment variable: SALESFORCE_ORGANIZATION_ID.
SalesforceLWC : Verify a Salesforce OAuth Client Credentials auth token using the oauth2/userinfo REST endpoint. Required environment variables: SALESFORCE_ORGANIZATION_ID, SALESFORCE_DOMAIN.
GenesysCloud : Verify the auth token using Genesys SDK UsersAPI.
Twilio : Verify the auth token for Twilio. Required environment variable: TWILIO_FLEX_ENVIRONMENT.
Skip : Skip auth token verification. It shouldn't be used in production.
Example:
$ export AUTH_OPTION = 'Salesforce'
Each token type might have a different means of validation. You decide how the token is validated. Without any changes, auth.check_auth returns false for every request.
Customize allowed origins (recommended)
To limit the origins that can access your service, change the value of config.CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS variable. The default value * will allow any origin to visit your service.
Generate and store a JWT secret key
In order for the UI connector service to send secure authentication tokens back
to the client, it must encrypt them using a JWT secret key. The key's value can
be any arbitrary string, although it should be unique and difficult to guess.
This secret key will be stored in Secret Manager .
Set environment variable
JWT_SECRET_NAME : The name for the secret key in Secret Manager. It can be any arbitrary name. Recommended value: aa-integration-jwt-secret .
Generate the key
We recommend generating a random hash as the JWT secret key so that it cannot be
guessed by attackers. To do so, you can use
python secrets to generate
secure random numbers for it.
# generate_secret_key.py
import secrets
jwt_secret_key = secrets.token_bytes ( 16 )
print ( jwt_secret_key ) # Output example: b'L\x9b\xd6i4\xc3\x1d\x95\xe3\xf78z\xdda\x97\xec'
Store the key in Secret Manager
In the following example command, replace my_key with the secret key you plan
to use.
$ python generate_secret_key.py | gcloud secrets create $JWT_SECRET_NAME --data-file = - \
--replication-policy = user-managed --locations = $SERVICE_REGION
Set up Memorystore for Redis
To set up Redis, you need the following environment variables:
VPC_CONNECTOR_NAME : The name of your Serverless VPC Access connector
for connecting Cloud Run services to
Memorystore for Redis . Recommended
value: aa-integration-vpc .
VPC_NETWORK : The VPC network to attach your Serverless VPC Access connector
to. The value should be default if you don't set up VPC for your Google Cloud project.
VPC_SUBNET : The name of the authorized VPC network that your Redis instance is attached to. The value should be default
if you haven't customized VPC network settings.
REDIS_IP_RANGE : An unreserved internal IP network for your Serverless VPC Access connector. A /28 of unallocated space is required. Recommended value:
10.8.0.0/28 (this value should work for most new projects).
REDIS_INSTANCE_ID : A name for your Redis instance. Recommended value:
aa-integration-redis .
Create a Redis instance in the region of your Cloud Run services
Run the following command:
$ gcloud redis instances create $REDIS_INSTANCE_ID --size = 5 --region = $SERVICE_REGION
You can connect to a Redis instance from Cloud Run by using Direct Egress or Serverless VPC Access .
Create a Serverless VPC Access connector {:#create-svpca-connector} (Optional)
This is optional now if customers choose Direct Egress. If you choose Serverless VPC Access, you'll need to create a Serverless VPC Access connector. For more details about this step, see the
Cloud Run tutorial .
Verify that the Serverless VPC Access API is enabled for your project:
$ gcloud services enable vpcaccess.googleapis.com
Create a Serverless VPC Access connector with a custom IP range:
$ gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create $VPC_CONNECTOR_NAME \
--network $VPC_NETWORK \
--region $SERVICE_REGION \
--range $REDIS_IP_RANGE
Save the Redis host and Redis port as environment variables
Set the IP Address of your Redis instance to environment variable
REDIS_HOST .
Set the port number of your Redis instance to environment variable
REDIS_PORT .
Deploy the UI connector service
For the UI connector service, you need the following environment variables:
CONNECTOR_SERVICE_NAME : The Cloud Run service name of your UI Connector.
Recommended value: ui-connector .
CONNECTOR_IMAGE_NAME : The image name of your UI Connector service. It can be
the same as CONNECTOR_SERVICE_NAME . Recommended value: ui-connector .
Build the Docker image
Under the /ui-connector folder, run the following command:
$ gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/ $GCP_PROJECT_ID / $CONNECTOR_IMAGE_NAME
Deploy UI connector to Cloud Run

--set-env-vars REDISHOST = $REDIS_HOST ,REDISPORT = $REDIS_PORT
Save the deployed URL
Set the deployed URL as the INTERCEPTOR_SERVICE_URL environment variable.
Configure Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions
Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions use the following:
Topics
Conversation profile
Service account
Service account permission for interceptor service
Create Cloud Pub/Sub topics
Create a Cloud Pub/Sub topic for each kind of event notification you need from Dialogflow. The available event notification types are:
New suggestion events : Events sent when new Agent Assist
suggestions are available (for example, new Smart Reply suggestions in
response to a customer utterance).
New message events : Events sent whenever a new utterance is recognized
from an agent or customer (for example, customer says Hi ).
New conversation lifecycle events : Events sent for certain conversation
lifecycle changes (for example, when a conversation is started, or when it is
completed).
New recognition result-notification events : Events sent when intermediate transcript is
recognized from an agent or customer (for example, customer says Hi, how can I help you? ,
an intermediate transcript is Hi how can while customer is speaking).
Make a note of the topic ID and topic name for later backend deployment.
Configure a conversation profile
Configure a conversation profile with
the Cloud Pub/Sub topics that you created in the previous step.
When you create a new conversation profile, select Pub/Sub notifications
and then Enable Pub/Sub notifications . Once enabled, you can check
the boxes next to the types of notifications you'd like to enable and
enter the topic ID for the notification's associated Cloud Pub/Sub topic.
Select JSON as the message format for each topic.
Create service account for Pub/Sub subscription identity
Create a service account representing the Pub/Sub subscription identity using the following command:
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create cloud-run-pubsub-invoker \
--display-name "Cloud Run Pub/Sub Invoker"
Give the service account permission to invoke your interceptor service
Run the following command:
$ gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding $INTERCEPTOR_SERVICE_NAME \
--member = serviceAccount:cloud-run-pubsub-invoker@ $GCP_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/run.invoker
Create Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions for topics
For each topic that you created, you must create a corresponding Cloud Pub/Sub subscription.
New suggestion events
Replace your-new-suggestion-topic-id with the Cloud Pub/Sub topic you
configured for new suggestions:
$ export TOPIC_ID = 'your-new-suggestion-topic-id' && gcloud pubsub subscriptions create $SUBSCRIPTION_NAME --topic $TOPIC_ID \
--push-endpoint = $INTERCEPTOR_SERVICE_URL /human-agent-assistant-event \
--push-auth-service-account = cloud-run-pubsub-invoker@ $GCP_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
New message events
Replace your-new-message-event-topic-id with the Cloud Pub/Sub topic you
configured for new message events:
$ export TOPIC_ID = 'your-new-message-event-topic-id' && gcloud pubsub subscriptions create $SUBSCRIPTION_NAME --topic $TOPIC_ID \
--push-endpoint = $INTERCEPTOR_SERVICE_URL /new-message-event \
--push-auth-service-account = cloud-run-pubsub-invoker@ $GCP_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
Conversation lifecycle events
Replace your-conversation-lifecycle-event-topic with the Cloud Pub/Sub topic you configured for new conversation lifecycle events:
$ export TOPIC_ID = 'your-conversation-lifecycle-event-topic' && gcloud pubsub subscriptions create $SUBSCRIPTION_NAME --topic $TOPIC_ID \
--push-endpoint = $INTERCEPTOR_SERVICE_URL /conversation-lifecycle-event \
--push-auth-service-account = cloud-run-pubsub-invoker@ $GCP_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
New recognition-result notification events
$ export TOPIC_ID = 'your-new-recognition-result-notification-event-topic' && gcloud pubsub subscriptions create $SUBSCRIPTION_NAME --topic $TOPIC_ID \
--push-endpoint = $INTERCEPTOR_SERVICE_URL /new-recognition-result-notification-event \
--push-auth-service-account = cloud-run-pubsub-invoker@ $GCP_PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
