Verify Bearer Tokens
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: Bearer tokens in authorization headers are not sent by default. If you
require a bearer token token to be sent, request it when
registering with Google .
A Bearer Token is set in the Authorization header of every In-App Action HTTP Request. For example:
POST /approve?expenseId=abc123 HTTP / 1.1
Host : your-domain.com
Authorization : Bearer AbCdEf123456
Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent : Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/1.0 (KHTML, like Gecko; Gmail Actions)
confirmed = Approved
The string "AbCdEf123456" in the example above is the bearer authorization token.
This is a cryptographic token produced by Google.
All bearer tokens sent with actions have the azp (authorized party) field as
gmail@system.gserviceaccount.com , with the audience field specifying the sender domain as a URL of the form
https:// . For example, if the email is from noreply@example.com , the
audience is https://example.com .
If using bearer tokens, verify that the request is coming from Google
and is intended for the the sender domain. If the token doesn't verify, the service should
respond to the request with an HTTP response code 401 (Unauthorized) .
Bearer Tokens are part of the OAuth V2 standard and widely adopted by Google APIs.
Verifying Bearer Tokens
Services are encouraged to use the open source Google API Client library to verify Bearer tokens:
Java : https://github.com/google/google-api-java-client
Python : https://github.com/google/google-api-python-client
.NET : https://github.com/google/google-api-dotnet-client

// For example, for "Authorization: Bearer AbCdEf123456" use "AbCdEf123456"

if ( idToken == null || ! idToken . getPayload (). getAuthorizedParty (). equals ( GMAIL_AUTHORIZED_PARTY )) {
System . out . println ( "Invalid token" );
System . exit ( - 1 );
}
// Token originates from Google and is targeted to a specific client.
System . out . println ( "The token is valid" );
System . out . println ( "Token details:" );

}
Python

# Verify valid token, signed by google.com, intended for a third party.
