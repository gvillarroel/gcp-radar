Choose Gmail API scopes
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document contains Gmail API-specific authorization and
authentication information. Before reading this document, be sure to read the
Google Workspace's general authentication and authorization information at
Learn about authentication and authorization .
Configure OAuth 2.0 for authorization
Configure the OAuth consent screen and choose scopes
to define what information is displayed to users and app reviewers, and register
your app so that you can publish it later.
Gmail API scopes
To define the level of access granted to your app, you need to identify and
declare authorization scopes . An authorization scope is an OAuth 2.0 URI string
that contains the Google Workspace app name, what kind of data it accesses, and
the level of access. Scopes are your app's requests to work with Google Workspace data, including
users' Google Account data.
When your app is installed, a user is asked to validate the scopes used
by the app. Generally, you should choose the most narrowly focused scope
possible and avoid requesting scopes that your app doesn't require. Users more
readily grant access to limited, clearly described scopes.
Whenever possible, use non-sensitive scopes to narrow access to only the
specific features needed by an app.
If your public application uses scopes that permit access to
certain user data, it must complete a verification process. If you see unverified
app on the screen when testing your application, you must submit a
verification request to remove it. Find out more about
unverified apps
and get answers to
frequently asked questions about app verification in the Help Center.
Non-sensitive scopes
The following Gmail API scopes are recommended for most use cases:
Scope code
Description
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose
Manage drafts and send emails when you interact with the add-on.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.action
View your email messages when you interact with the add-on.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels
See and edit your email labels.
Sensitive scopes
Scope code
Description
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.metadata
View your email message metadata when the add-on is running.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.readonly
View your email messages when the add-on is running.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send
Send email on your behalf.
Restricted scopes
Scope code
Description
https://mail.google.com/
Read, compose, send, and permanently delete all your email from Gmail.
Note: Request this scope only if your application needs
to immediately and permanently delete threads and messages, bypassing the
trash. You can perform all other actions using less permissive scopes.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly
View your email messages and settings.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose
Manage drafts and send emails.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.insert
Add emails into your Gmail mailbox.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify
Read, compose, and send emails from your Gmail account. This scope
does not allow immediate, permanent deletion of threads and messages,
bypassing the trash.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.metadata
View your email message metadata such as labels and headers, but not
the email body.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic
See, edit, create, or change your email settings and filters in Gmail.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.sharing
Manage your sensitive mail settings, including who can manage your mail.
Note: Operations guarded by this scope are restricted to
administrative use only. They are only available to Google Workspace
customers using a service account with domain-wide delegation.
The scopes in the preceding tables indicate their sensitivity, according to the
following definitions:
Non-sensitive : These scopes provide the smallest scope of authorization
and only require basic OAuth App
Verification . For more
information, see Verification
requirements .
Sensitive : These scopes provide access to specific Google user data that
users authorize for your app. They require additional OAuth App
Verification . For more
information, see Sensitive and Restricted Scope
Requirements .
Restricted : These scopes provide wide access to Google user data and
require restricted scope OAuth App
Verification . For more
information, see Google API Services User Data
Policy and Additional Requirements
for Specific API
Scopes .
If you store restricted scope data on servers (or transmit), then you must
go through a security assessment.
Additional information that governs your use and access to Gmail APIs when you
request to access user data can be found in the Google Workspace API
user data and developer
policy .
If your app requires access to any other Google APIs, you can add those scopes
as well. For more information about Google API scopes, see Using OAuth 2.0 to
Access Google APIs .
For more information about specific OAuth 2.0 scopes, see OAuth 2.0 Scopes for
Google APIs .
OAuth verification
Using certain sensitive OAuth scopes may require your app to complete Google's
OAuth verification process .
The OAuth App Verification
FAQ can help you determine if
this is necessary and what type of verification is required.
