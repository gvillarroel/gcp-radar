Manage Gmail filters
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document explains how to use filters in the Gmail API.
You can use the
settings.filters
resource to configure advanced filtering rules for an account. Filters can
automatically add or remove labels or
forward emails to verified
aliases based on the
attributes or content of the incoming message.
For information on how to
create ,
list ,
get , or
delete
Gmail filters, see the
settings.filters
resource.
Match criteria
Filter messages by properties such as the sender, subject, date, size, and
message contents. Filters only apply to specific messages and not the entire
email thread. Any query using Gmail's advanced search
syntax can also be used in a
filter. For example, common filter patterns include:
Filter
Matches
criteria.from='sender@example.com'
Emails from sender@example.com
criteria.size=10485760 criteria.sizeComparison='larger'
Emails larger than 10 MB
criteria.hasAttachment=true
Emails with an attachment
criteria.subject='[People with Pets]'
Emails with [People with Pets] in the subject
criteria.query='"my important project"'
Emails containing my important project
criteria.negatedQuery='"secret knock"'
Emails not containing secret knock
If multiple criteria are present in a filter, a message must satisfy all
criteria for the filter to apply.
Actions
Apply an
Action
to messages matching the filter criteria. With an Action , you can forward
messages to a verified email address, or add and remove
labels .
Add or remove labels to change the disposition of the email. For example, some
common actions include:
Action
Effect
action.removeLabelIds=['INBOX']
Archive the email (skip the inbox)
action.removeLabelIds=['UNREAD']
Mark as read
action.removeLabelIds=['SPAM']
Never mark as spam
action.removeLabelIds=['IMPORTANT']
Never mark as important
action.addLabelIds=['IMPORTANT']
Mark as important
action.addLabelIds=['TRASH']
Delete the email
action.addLabelIds=['STARRED']
Mark as starred
action.addLabelIds=['<user label id>']
Tag the mail with a user-defined label. Only one user-defined label is allowed per filter.

The following code samples show how to label and archive messages from a mailing
list:
