Manage S/MIME certificates with the Gmail API
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document explains how to use S/MIME email certificates in the
Gmail API.
The Gmail API provides programmatic access to manage S/MIME email
certificates for users in a Google Workspace domain.
An administrator must turn on hosted S/MIME for the
domain
for the certificates to work.
The S/MIME standard provides a
specification for public key encryption and signing of MIME data. When S/MIME
certificates are configured in a user account, Gmail uses them in
the following ways:
Sign outgoing mail with the user certificate and private key.
Decrypt incoming mail with the user private key.
Encrypt outgoing mail with the recipient certificate and public key.
Verify incoming mail with the sender certificate and public key.
You can generate individual S/MIME certificates and upload them using the
Gmail API. Each S/MIME certificate is for a specific alias for a user
email account. Aliases include the primary email address and custom "Send As"
addresses. The API marks a single S/MIME certificate as the default for each
alias.
For more information on aliases, see Manage aliases and signatures with the
Gmail API .
Authorize API access
To authorize access to the Gmail API, use one of the following
methods:
Use a service account with domain-wide delegation of authority . For an
explanation of these terms, see Learn about authentication and
authorization . To
enable this option, see Create access
credentials .
Use a standard OAuth 2.0 flow that requires end-user consent to obtain an
OAuth 2.0 access token. For more information, see Learn about
authentication and authorization .
To use this option, the domain administrator must select the
Enable S/MIME encryption for sending and receiving emails checkbox in
the Google Admin console. For more information, see Turn on hosted S/MIME
in your
Google Admin console .
ACL scopes
The Gmail API relies on the same ACL
scopes as the Gmail
sendAs methods:
gmail.settings.basic : This scope is required for updating the primary
SendAs S/MIME.
gmail.settings.sharing : This scope is required for updating the custom
from S/MIME.
Configure S/MIME keys
The
settings.sendAs.smimeInfo
resource provides several methods to manage S/MIME certificates. Each
certificate is associated with one send-as alias for a user.
To determine the send-as aliases for a user, use the
settings.sendAs.list
method on the
settings.sendAs
resource.
Upload an S/MIME key
Use the
settings.sendAs.smimeInfo.insert
method on the settings.sendAs.smimeInfo resource to upload a new S/MIME key
for an alias belonging to a user. Identify the target alias using the following
path parameters:
userId : The user's email address. Use the special value me to indicate
the authenticated user.
sendAsEmail : The alias for which you're uploading the key. This email
address appears in the From: header for mail sent using this alias.
The S/MIME certificate and private key should be present in the
pkcs12
field in that format; no other fields should be set in the request. The pkcs12
field contains both the user S/MIME key and the signing certificate chain. The
API performs standard validations on this field before accepting it, verifying
the following:
The subject matches the specified email address.
Expirations are valid.
The issuing certificate authority (CA) is in the Google trusted list.
The certificates match Gmail's technical constraints.
If the key is encrypted, the password should be in the
encryptedKeyPassword
field. A successful settings.sendAs.smimeInfo.insert method call returns the
settings.sendAs.smimeInfo resource id used to refer to the key in the
future.
List a user's S/MIME keys
Use the
settings.sendAs.smimeInfo.list
method on the settings.sendAs.smimeInfo resource to return the list of S/MIME
keys for the given user for the given alias. Identify the target alias using the
following path parameters:
userId : The user's email address. Use the special value me to indicate
the authenticated user.
sendAsEmail : The alias for which to list keys. This email address appears
in the From: header for mail sent using this alias.
Keys are only returned in PEM format and only contain the
S/MIME certificate, not the private key.
Retrieve the S/MIME keys for an alias
Use the
settings.sendAs.smimeInfo.get
method on the settings.sendAs.smimeInfo resource to return the specific S/MIME
keys for a specific send-as alias for a user. Identify the target alias using
the following path parameters:
userId : The user's email address. Use the special value me to indicate
the authenticated user.
sendAsEmail : The alias for which you're retrieving the keys. This email
address appears in the From: header for mail sent using this alias.
Keys are only returned in PEM format and only contain the
S/MIME certificate, not the private key.
Delete an S/MIME key
Use the
settings.sendAs.smimeInfo.delete
method on the settings.sendAs.smimeInfo resource to delete the specified
S/MIME key from an alias. Identify the target alias using the following path
parameters:
userId : The user's email address. Use the special value me to indicate
the authenticated user.
sendAsEmail : The alias for which you're deleting the keys. This email
address appears in the From: header for mail sent using this alias.
id : The immutable ID for the smimeInfo .
A deleted key is no longer visible or usable. S/MIME
emails received that are encrypted using the corresponding public key cannot
be decrypted. Before deleting a key, revoke it with its issuing authority (CA).
Set the default S/MIME key for an alias
Use the
settings.sendAs.smimeInfo.setDefault
method on the settings.sendAs.smimeInfo resource to mark the specified S/MIME
key as the default for the specified alias. Identify the target alias using the
following path parameters:
userId : The user's email address. Use the special value me to indicate
the authenticated user.
sendAsEmail : The alias for which keys to set as default. This email
address appears in the From: header for mail sent using this alias.
id : The immutable ID for the smimeInfo .
Only one S/MIME key is the default for a user's `SendAs`.
Calling the settings.sendAs.smimeInfo.setDefault method unsets the
previous default.
When receiving S/MIME messages signed with a given key,
Gmail associates the key with the not_before
validity date farthest in the future as the default when encrypting mail sent
to the associated user. To ensure that the new default key is used by
Gmail users with whom the user has already communicated, ensure
that the new default key has a not_before date later than the
previous default key or revoke the previous default key.

Manage multiple users' certificates
These code samples show how to manage certificates for multiple users in an
organization in one batch call:
Insert certificates from a CSV file
The following is a sample CSV file that lists user IDs and the path to each
user's certificate:
$ cat certificates.csv
user1@example.com,/path/to/user1_cert.p12,cert_password_1
user2@example.com,/path/to/user2_cert.p12,cert_password_2
user3@example.com,/path/to/user3_cert.p12,cert_password_3

Certificate management
This sample combines several methods from the settings.sendAs.smimeInfo
resource to show how to manage certificates for your organization. It lists the
certificates for the user. If the default certificate is expired or not set, it
uploads the certificate found in the specified file. Then it sets the
certificate whose expiration is furthest into the future as the default.
This function then processes a CSV file, similar to the previous Insert
certificates from a CSV file sample.
