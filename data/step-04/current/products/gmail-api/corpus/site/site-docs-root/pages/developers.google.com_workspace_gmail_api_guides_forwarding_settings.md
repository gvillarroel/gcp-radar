Manage email forwarding
Stay organized with collections

This document explains how to configure email forwarding in Gmail API.
You can use the
settings resource to
configure forwarding for an account. For an email address to be used as a
forwarding email address, it must fulfill one of the following criteria:
The email address is verified. For more information, see Create and verify
forwarding addresses .
The email address belongs to the same domain as the sender.
The email address belongs to a subdomain within the same domain of the
sender.
The email address belongs to a domain alias configured as part of the same
Google Workspace account.
If the forwarding email address doesn't adhere to one of these rules, setting up
forwarding using the API fails.
For information on how to
create ,
list ,
get ,
or
delete
forwarding addresses, see the methods on the
settings.forwardingAddresses
resource.
For information on how to
get
or
update
the auto-forwarding settings, see the methods on the
settings resource.
Create and verify forwarding addresses
You must
create
forwarding addresses before you use them. In some cases, users must also verify
ownership of the address.
If Gmail requires user verification for a forwarding address, the
address is returned with a
VerificationStatus
of pending . A verification message is automatically sent to the target email
address. The owner of the email address must complete the verification process
before it can be used.
Forwarding addresses that don't require verification have a verification status
of accepted .
Enable automatic forwarding
You can choose to forward all of your new messages to another email address.
To do so, call the
updateAutoForwarding
method to enable auto-forwarding for an account. The call requires a registered
and verified forwarding address and an action to take on forwarded messages.
These are set using the
AutoForwarding
object.
The
disposition
field is used to set the message state after the message is forwarded. The
default value is dispositionUnspecified , but you can't set this field to
dispositionUnspecified .
The following code samples show how to enable auto-forwarding and then move
forwarded messages to the trash:

To disable auto-forwarding, call the updateAutoForwarding method and set the
enabled
field on the AutoForwarding object to false .
Forward specific messages
Automatic forwarding sends all received Gmail messages to the target
account. To forward specific messages, set up a
filter to create rules that
forward messages in response to message attributes or content.
To forward messages to multiple accounts, create a filter for every forwarding
email address.
