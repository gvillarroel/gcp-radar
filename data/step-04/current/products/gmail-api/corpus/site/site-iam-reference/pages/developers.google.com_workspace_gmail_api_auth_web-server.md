Implement server-side authorization
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Requests to the Gmail API must be authorized using OAuth 2.0
credentials. You should use server-side flow when your application
needs to access Google APIs on behalf of the user, for example when the user is
offline. This approach requires passing a one-time authorization code from
your client to your server; this code is used to acquire an access token and
refresh tokens for your server.
To learn more about server-side Google OAuth 2.0 implementation, see
Using OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications .
Contents
Create a client ID and client secret
To get started using Gmail API, you need to first
use
the setup tool , which guides you through creating a project in the
Google API Console and enabling the API.
From the Credentials page, click Create credentials > OAuth client
ID to create your OAuth 2.0 credentials or Create credentials > Service
account key to create a service account.
If you created an OAuth client ID, then select your application type.
Fill in the form and click Create .
Your application's client IDs and service account keys are now listed on
the Credentials page. For details, click a client ID; parameters vary
depending on the ID type, but might include email address, client secret,
JavaScript origins, or redirect URIs.
Take note of the Client ID as you'll need to add it to your code later.
Handling authorization requests
When a user loads your application for the first time, they are presented with
a dialog to grant permission for your application to access their Gmail
account with the requested permission scopes . After this initial
authorization, the user is only presented with the permission dialog if your
app's client ID changes or the requested scopes have changed.
Authenticate the user
This initial sign-in returns an authorization result object that contains an
authorization code if successful.
Exchange the authorization code for an access token
The authorization code is a one-time code that your server can exchange for
an access token . This access token is passed to the Gmail API to grant
your application access to user data for a limited time.
If your application requires offline access, the first time your app exchanges
the authorization code, it also receives a refresh token that it uses to
receive a new access token after a previous token has expired. Your application
stores this refresh token (generally in a database on your server) for
later use.
Important: Always store user refresh tokens. If your application needs a new
refresh token it must send a request with the approval_prompt query parameter
set to force . This will cause the user to see a dialog to grant permission
to your application again.
The following code samples demonstrate exchanging an authorization code for
an access token with offline access and storing the refresh token.

Authorizing with stored credentials
When users visit your app after a successful first-time authorization
flow, your application can use a stored refresh token to authorize requests
without prompting the user again.
If you have already authenticated the user, your application can retrieve
the refresh token from its database and store the token in a server-side
session. If the refresh token is revoked or is otherwise invalid, you'll
need to catch this and take appropriate action.
Using OAuth 2.0 credentials
Once OAuth 2.0 credentials have been retrieved as shown in the
previous section, they can be used to authorize a Gmail service object
and send requests to the API.
Instantiate a service object
This code sample shows how to instantiate a service object and then authorize
it to make API requests.
Python
from apiclient.discovery import build
# ...
def build_service ( credentials ):
"""Build a Gmail service object.
Args:
credentials: OAuth 2.0 credentials.
Returns:
Gmail service object.
"""
http = httplib2 . Http ()
http = credentials . authorize ( http )
return build ( 'gmail' , 'v1' , http = http )
Send authorized requests and check for revoked credentials
The following code snippet uses an authorized Gmail service instance to
retrieve a list of messages.
If an error occurs, the code checks for an HTTP 401 status code,
which should be handled by redirecting the user to the authorization
URL.
More Gmail API operations are documented in the API Reference .
Python
from googleapiclient import errors
# ...
def ListMessages ( service , user , query = '' ):
"""Gets a list of messages.
Args:
service: Authorized Gmail API service instance.
user: The email address of the account.
query: String used to filter messages returned.
Eg.- 'label:UNREAD' for unread Messages only.
Returns:
List of messages that match the criteria of the query. Note that the
returned list contains Message IDs, you must use get with the
appropriate id to get the details of a Message.
"""
try :
response = service . users () . messages () . list ( userId = user , q = query ) . execute ()
messages = []
if 'messages' in response :
messages . extend ( response [ 'messages' ])
while 'nextPageToken' in response :
page_token = response [ 'nextPageToken' ]
response = service . users () . messages () . list ( userId = user , q = query ,
pageToken = page_token ) . execute ()
if 'messages' in response :
messages . extend ( response [ 'messages' ])
return messages
except errors . HttpError as error :
print ( 'An error occurred: %s ' % error )
if error . resp . status == 401 :
# Credentials have been revoked.
# TODO: Redirect the user to the authorization URL.
raise NotImplementedError ()
Next steps
Once you are comfortable authorizing Gmail API requests, you're ready to
start handling messages, threads, and labels, as described in the
Developers Guides sections.
You can learn more about the available API methods in the
API Reference .
Warning: When testing your app
during development, be sure to use a test Gmail account that you
don't care about. This will prevent you from accidentally causing havoc
with your actual emails, threads, and labels.
