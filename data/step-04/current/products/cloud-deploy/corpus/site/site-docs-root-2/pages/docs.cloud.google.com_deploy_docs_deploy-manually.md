Deploy manually
Stay organized with collections

This page describes how to manually deploy your application to a specific target.
During normal use, Cloud Deploy deploys your application into each
target in the progression , in sequence.
But you can also manually deploy your application to any defined target.
You can manually deploy a new or an existing release.
Manually deploy an existing release
If a release is already created, you can simply promote it to the intended
target:
gcloud deploy releases promote -- release = RELEASE_NAME \
-- delivery - pipeline = PIPELINE_NAME \
-- to - target = TARGET_NAME \
-- region = REGION
Where:
RELEASE_NAME is the name of the release which you're
manually promoting to the intended target.
PIPELINE_NAME is the name of the delivery pipeline that
describes the automated deployment progression you're overriding.
TARGET_NAME is the name of the target you're manually
deploying to.
REGION is the name of the region in which the release
was created, for example us-central1 . This is required.
Manually deploy a new release
By default, when you create a release Cloud Deploy automatically
deploys it to the first target in the promotion sequence. But you can specify a
target other than the first one.
As with the default first target in the progression, Cloud Deploy
automatically creates the rollout for the specified target and deploys the
release there.
To manually deploy a new release, run the following command:
gcloud deploy releases create \
-- release = RELEASE_NAME \
-- delivery - pipeline = PIPELINE_NAME \
-- to - target = TARGET_NAME \
-- region = REGION
Where:
RELEASE_NAME is the name of the release which you're
manually promoting to the intended target.
PIPELINE_NAME is the name of the delivery pipeline that
describes the automated deployment progression you're overriding.
TARGET_NAME is the name of the target you're manually
deploying to.
REGION is the name of the region in which to create the
release, for example us-central1 . This is required.
Effect of manual deployment on the progression
When you manually deploy to a specific target and then promote the release
without specifying a target, Cloud Deploy promotes it to the correct
next target in the progression. This is because the service tracks the furthest
target to which a release has been deployed. If the release is already in the
last target in the progression, Cloud Deploy returns a message
indicating there is no further target to promote to.
