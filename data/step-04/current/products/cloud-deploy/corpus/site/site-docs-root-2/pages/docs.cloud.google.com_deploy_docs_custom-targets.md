About custom targets
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes how custom targets work in Cloud Deploy.
Cloud Deploy includes built-in support for various runtime
environments as targets . But the list of
supported target types is finite. With custom targets, you can deploy to other
systems besides the supported runtimes.
A custom target is a target that represents an arbitrary output environment
other than a runtime that Cloud Deploy supports.
The page Create a custom target describes
the process of defining a custom target type and implementing it as a target in
a delivery pipeline.
What goes into a custom target?
Each custom target consists of the following components:
Tasks , that define how to render and deploy for your
custom target type
Your implementations of the custom render and custom deploy consume values
provided by Cloud Deploy and must fulfill a
set of required outputs .
The custom render is optional, but you must create one unless your custom
target will work correctly if rendered with the
Cloud Deploy built-in renderers .
A custom target type definition
The CustomTargetType is a Cloud Deploy resource that identifies
the tasks that targets of this type use for release render and rollout deploy
activities.
A target definition
The target definition for a custom target is the same as for any target type,
except that it includes the customTarget property, whose value is the name
of the CustomTargetType .
With those components in place, you can use the target as you would any target,
referencing it from your delivery pipeline progression, and making full use of
Cloud Deploy features, such as
promotion and approvals , and
rollbacks .
An example
The quickstart
Define and use a custom target type
creates a custom target type that includes commands to run on a
container image—one command for render and one for deploy. The commands,
in this case, just add text to the required output files for render and
deploy.
For more examples, see Custom target examples .
Required inputs and outputs
Any custom target type defined for Cloud Deploy must satisfy
requirements for input and output, for both render and deploy. This section
lists what inputs and outputs are required, and how they're provided.
Cloud Deploy provides the required inputs, for both render and
deploy, as environment variables. The following sections list these inputs, as
well as the outputs that your custom render and deploy must return.
Deploy parameters as environment variables
In addition to the environment variables listed in this section,
Cloud Deploy can pass to your custom containers any
deploy parameters you've set.

Inputs to custom renders
For custom renders, Cloud Deploy provides the following inputs, as
environment variables. For multi-phase rollouts ( canary deployments ),
Cloud Deploy provides these variables for each phase.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_PROJECT
The Google Cloud project number for the project in which the custom
target is created.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_PROJECT_ID
The Google Cloud project ID for the project.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_LOCATION
The Google Cloud region for the custom target type.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_DELIVERY_PIPELINE
The name of the Cloud Deploy delivery pipeline referencing the
custom target type.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_RELEASE
The name of the release for which the render operation is invoked.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_TARGET
The name of the Cloud Deploy target that uses the custom target
type.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_PHASE
The rollout phase
to which the render corresponds.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_REQUEST_TYPE
For the custom render, this is always RENDER .
CLOUD_DEPLOY_FEATURES
A comma-separated list of Cloud Deploy features which the custom
container must support. This variable is populated based on features
configured in your delivery pipeline.
If your implementation doesn't support the features in this list, we recommend
that it fail during rendering.
For standard deployments ,
this is empty. For canary deployments, the value is CANARY . If the value
provided by Cloud Deploy is CANARY , your render is invoked for
each phase in the canary. The canary percentage for each phase is provided in
the CLOUD_DEPLOY_PERCENTAGE_DEPLOY environment variable.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_PERCENTAGE_DEPLOY
The percentage of deployment associated with this render operation. If the
CLOUD_DEPLOY_FEATURES environment variable is set to CANARY , your custom
render is called for each phase, and this variable is set to the canary
percentage for each phase. For standard deployments
and for canary deployments that have reached the stable phase, this is
100 .
CLOUD_DEPLOY_STORAGE_TYPE
The storage provider. Always GCS .
CLOUD_DEPLOY_INPUT_GCS_PATH
The Cloud Storage path for the render-file archive written when the release
was created.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_OUTPUT_GCS_PATH
The Cloud Storage path where the custom render container is
expected to upload artifacts to be used for deployment. Note that the render
must upload a file named results.json containing the results of this render
operation. For more information, see Outputs from custom render .
Outputs from custom render
Your custom render must provide the information described in this section. The
information must be included in the results file, named results.json , located
in the Cloud Storage bucket provided by Cloud Deploy
( CLOUD_DEPLOY_OUTPUT_GCS_PATH ).
Rendered configuration file or files
A results.json file, containing the following information:
An indication of the success or failure state of the custom render.
Valid values are SUCCEEDED and FAILED .
(Optional) any error messages that are generated by the custom render.
The Cloud Storage path for the rendered configuration file or
files.
The path for all the rendered configuration files is the full URI. You
populate it partly using the value of the CLOUD_DEPLOY_OUTPUT_GCS_PATH
provided by Cloud Deploy.
You must provide the rendered configuration file, even if it's empty. The
contents of the file can be anything, in any format, as long as it's
consumable by your custom deploy. We recommend this file be human
readable, so that you and other users in your organization can view this
file in the release inspector .
(Optional) a map of any metadata you want to include
Your custom target creates this metadata. This metadata is stored on the
release, in the custom_metadata field.
If you need to examine the results.json file, for example for debugging, you
can find the Cloud Storage URI to it in the Cloud Build logs.
Example render results file
The following is a sample results.json file output from a custom render:
{
"resultStatus" : "SUCCEEDED" ,
"manifestFile" : "gs://bucket/my-pipeline/release-001/rollout-a/01234/custom-output/manifest.yaml" ,
"failureMessage" : "" ,
"metadata" : {
"key1" : "val" ,
"key2" : "val"
}
}
Inputs to custom deploys
For custom deploys, Cloud Deploy provides the following
inputs, as environment variables:
CLOUD_DEPLOY_PROJECT
The Google Cloud project number for the project in which the custom
target is created.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_PROJECT_ID
The Google Cloud project ID for the project.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_LOCATION
The Google Cloud region for the custom target type.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_DELIVERY_PIPELINE
The name of the Cloud Deploy delivery pipeline referencing the
target that uses the custom target type.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_RELEASE
The name of the release for which the deploy operation is invoked.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_ROLLOUT
The name of the Cloud Deploy rollout that this deploy is for.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_TARGET
The name of the Cloud Deploy target that uses the custom target
type.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_PHASE
The rollout phase
to which the deploy corresponds.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_REQUEST_TYPE
For the custom deploy, this is always DEPLOY .
CLOUD_DEPLOY_FEATURES
A comma-separated list of Cloud Deploy features which the custom
container must support. This variable is populated based on features
configured in your delivery pipeline.
If your implementation doesn't support the features in this list, we recommend
that it fail during rendering.
For standard deployments ,
this is empty. For canary deployments, the value is CANARY . If the value
provided by Cloud Deploy is CANARY , your deploy is invoked for
each phase in the canary. The canary percentage for each phase is provided in
the CLOUD_DEPLOY_PERCENTAGE_DEPLOY environment variable.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_PERCENTAGE_DEPLOY
The percentage of deployment associated with this deploy operation. If the
CLOUD_DEPLOY_FEATURES environment variable is set to CANARY , your custom
deploy is called for each phase, and this variable is set to the canary
percentage for each phase. Your deploy must run for each phase.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_STORAGE_TYPE
The storage provider. Always GCS .
CLOUD_DEPLOY_INPUT_GCS_PATH
The Cloud Storage path where the custom renderer wrote the rendered
configuration files.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_SKAFFOLD_GCS_PATH
The Cloud Storage path to the rendered Skaffold configuration. If you
provided a Skaffold config with your release.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_MANIFEST_GCS_PATH
The Cloud Storage path to the rendered manifest file.
CLOUD_DEPLOY_OUTPUT_GCS_PATH
The path to the Cloud Storage directory where the custom deploy
container is expected to upload deploy artifacts. For more information, see
Outputs from custom deploy .
Outputs from custom deploy
Your custom deploy must write a results.json output file. This file must be
located in the Cloud Storage bucket provided by
Cloud Deploy ( CLOUD_DEPLOY_OUTPUT_GCS_PATH ).
The file must include the following:
An indication of the success or failure state of the custom deploy.
The following are the valid statuses:
SUCCEEDED
FAILED
SKIPPED
This is for canary deployments where canary phases are skipped , to go
straight to stable .
(Optional) a list of deploy artifact files, in the form of
Cloud Storage paths
The path is the full URI. You populate it partly using the value of the
CLOUD_DEPLOY_OUTPUT_GCS_PATH provided by
Cloud Deploy.
Files listed here are populated in
job run resources
as deploy artifacts.
(Optional) a failure message, if the custom deploy is unsuccessful (returning
a FAILED state)
This message is used to populate the failure_message on the
job run
for this deploy.
(Optional) a skip message, to provide additional information if the deploy
returns a SKIPPED status.
(Optional) a map of any metadata you want to include
Your custom target creates this metadata. This metadata is stored on the
job run
and on the rollout, in the custom_metadata field.
If you need to examine the results.json file, for example for debugging, you
can find the Cloud Storage URI for it in the Cloud Build logs.
Example deploy results file
The following is a sample results.json file output from a custom deploy:
{
"resultStatus" : "SUCCEEDED" ,
"artifactFiles" : [
"gs://bucket/my-pipeline/release-001/rollout-a/01234/custom-output/file1.yaml" ,
"gs://bucket/my-pipeline/release-001/rollout-a/01234/custom-output/file2.yaml"
],
"failureMessage" : "" ,
"skipMessage" : "" ,
"metadata" : {
"key1" : "val" ,
"key2" : "val"
}
}
Further information about custom targets
Here are some things to keep in mind when setting up and using custom target
types.
Executing the tasks
Your custom render and deploy tasks run in the Cloud Deploy
execution environment . You can't configure
your tasks to run on a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster.
Custom targets and deployment strategies
Custom targets are fully supported for
standard deployments.
Cloud Deploy supports
canary deployments as long as the
custom renderer and deployer support the canary feature.
You must use custom canary configuration .
Automated and custom-automated
canaries are not supported with custom targets.
Custom targets and deploy parameters
You can use deploy parameters with custom targets.
You can set them on the delivery pipeline
stage , on the target that uses
a custom target type, or on the
release .
Deploy parameters are passed to your custom render and deploy containers, as
environment variables, in addition to
those already provided .
Custom target examples
The cloud-deploy-samples repository contains a set of sample custom target implementations. The following samples
are available:
GitOps
Vertex AI
Terraform
Infrastructure Manager
Helm
Each sample includes a quickstart.
These samples are not a supported Google Cloud product, and are not
covered by a Google Cloud support contract. To report bugs or request
features in a Google Cloud product, contact Google Cloud
support.
