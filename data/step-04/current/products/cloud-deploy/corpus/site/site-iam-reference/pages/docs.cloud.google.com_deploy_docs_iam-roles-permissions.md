IAM roles and permissions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes Cloud Deploy service accounts, roles, and
permissions.
Access in Cloud Deploy is controlled using Identity and Access Management (IAM) .
IAM lets you create and manage
permissions for Google Cloud resources. Cloud Deploy provides a specific
set of predefined IAM roles
where each role contains a set of permissions. You can use these roles to give
more fine-grained access to specific Google Cloud resources and prevent unwanted
access to other resources. IAM lets you adopt the
security principle of least privilege ,
so you grant only the necessary access to your resources.
See Using IAM to restrict Cloud Deploy access
to learn about advanced access-control security features.
Service accounts in Cloud Deploy
By default, Cloud Deploy runs using the default Compute Engine
service account. For more information on configuring this service account for
use with Cloud Deploy, or choosing a different account, see the Cloud Deploy
execution service account
documentation.
Find out more about how
Cloud Deploy uses service accounts.
Predefined Cloud Deploy roles
With IAM, every API method in Cloud Deploy API requires
that the identity making the API request has the appropriate permissions to use
the resource. Permissions are granted by setting policies that grant roles to a
principal (user, group, or service account) of your project. You can grant
multiple roles to a principal on the same resource.
The IAM documentation includes a
searchable reference
of all predefined roles.
The following table lists the Cloud Deploy IAM roles and
the permissions that they include:

Note: If an alternate service account

permission for the service accounts specified in a rollout target.
In addition to the Cloud Deploy predefined roles, the
basic Viewer,
Editor, and Owner roles also include permissions related to Cloud Deploy.
However, we recommend that you grant predefined roles where possible to comply with the
security principle of least privilege .

Using IAM to restrict actions on Cloud Deploy resources
You can secure your Cloud Deploy resources using IAM
in the following ways:
IAM meta APIs
Use setIamPolicy on
Cloud Deploy resources to restrict actions on those resources.
Conditional IAM
Programmatically apply access policies ,
including the conditions under which to grant
or deny access.
You can use these policies and conditions to restrict the following actions on
your Cloud Deploy resources:
Create a delivery pipeline or target
You can grant this access to specific users or groups.
Update or delete a specific delivery pipeline
You can grant this access to specific users or groups.
Create a release for a specific delivery pipeline
You can grant this access to specific users or groups.
Update or delete a specific target
You can grant this access to specific users or groups.
Create or approve a rollout or promote a release
You can grant this access to specific users or groups for a specific target or
delivery pipeline.
You can also set a condition that limits this access to within a specified
time window.
