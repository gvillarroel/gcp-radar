Configuration schema reference
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Cloud Deploy configuration file or files define the
delivery pipeline , the
targets to deploy to, and the
progression of those targets.
The delivery pipeline configuration file can include
target definitions , or those can be in a separate file or
files. By convention, a file containing both the delivery pipeline config and
the target configs is called clouddeploy.yaml , and a pipeline config without
targets is called delivery-pipeline.yaml . But you can give these files any
name you want. Other resource definitions, such as
automations and
deploy policies , can also be in the same file as a
delivery pipeline or target definition.
Note: your organization might prefer to separate target definitions from the
pipeline definition, so that different roles can manage those configurations
separately. Cloud Deploy supports that practice.
What goes where
Cloud Deploy uses two main configuration files:
Delivery pipeline definition
Target definition
These can be separate files, or the delivery pipeline and targets can be
configured in the same file.
Note: After you define the configuration file or files, you create the delivery
pipeline and target resources using the command line, as described in
Registering the delivery pipeline and targets .
Structure of a delivery pipeline configuration file
The following is the structure of a delivery pipeline configuration, including
properties for target definitions. Some target properties are not included here.
See Target definitions for all target configuration
properties.

This YAML has three main components:
The main delivery pipeline and progression
The configuration file can include any number of pipeline definitions.
The target definitions
For simplicity, only one target is shown in this example, but there can be any
number of them. Also, targets can be defined in a separate file or files.
Custom target type definitions
Custom targets , require a custom target type
definition. As with targets and automations, custom target types can be
defined in the same file as the delivery pipeline, or in separate file.
Automation definitions
You can create any deploy automations in the same
file as your delivery pipeline and targets, or in a separate file or files.
For simplicity, only one Automation is shown here, but you can create as
many as you want.
These components are defined in the rest of this document.
Pipeline definition and progression
In addition to pipeline metadata, such as name , the main pipeline definition
includes a list of references to targets in
deployment sequence order. That is, the first target listed is the first
deployment target. After you've deployed to that target, promoting the release
deploys to the next target in the list.
The following are the configuration properties for a delivery pipeline, not
including target definitions.
metadata.name
The name field takes a string that must be unique per project and location.
metadata.annotations and metadata.labels
Delivery pipeline configuration can include annotations and labels. Annotations
and labels are stored with the delivery pipeline resource after the pipeline
has been registered .
For more information, see Using labels and annotations with Cloud Deploy .
description
An arbitrary string describing this delivery pipeline. This description is shown
in the delivery pipeline details in Google Cloud console.
suspended
A Boolean, which if true suspends the delivery pipeline
such that it can't be used to create, promote, roll back, or redeploy releases.
Also, if the delivery pipeline is suspended, you can't approve or reject a
rollout created from that pipeline.
The default is false .
serialPipeline
The beginning of the definition of a serial-progression delivery pipeline. This
stanza is required.
stages
A list of all targets to which this delivery pipeline is configured to deploy.
The list must be in the order of the delivery sequence you want. For example,
if you have targets called dev , staging , and production , list them in that
same order, so that your first deployment is to dev , and your final deployment
is into production .
Populate each stages.targetId field with the value of the metadata.name
field in the corresponding target definition. And under targetId , include
profiles :
serialPipeline :
stages :
- targetId :
profiles : []
strategy :
standard :
verify :
targetId
Identifies the specific target to use for this stage of the delivery pipeline.
The value is the metadata.name property from the target definition .
strategy.standard.verify set to true enables
deployment verification on the target. If no
deployment strategy is specified, the standard deployment strategy is used,
with verification set to false .
profiles
Takes a list of zero or more Skaffold profile names, from skaffold.yaml .
Cloud Deploy uses the profile with skaffold render
when creating the release. Skaffold profiles let you vary configuration between
targets while using a single configuration file.
strategy
Includes properties for specifying a deployment strategy. The following
strategies are supported:
standard:
The application is deployed fully to the specified target.
This is the default deployment strategy. If you omit strategy ,
Cloud Deploy uses the standard deployment strategy.
canary:
In a canary deployment , you
deploy a new version of your application progressively, replacing the already
running version by percentage-based increments (for example, 25%, then 50%,
then 75%, then fully.)
The deployment strategy is defined per target. For example, you might have a
canary strategy for your prod target, but a standard strategy (no strategy
specified) for your other targets.
For more information, see Use a deployment strategy .
strategy configuration
This section shows the configuration elements for strategy , for each supported
runtime.
Standard deployment strategy
The standard strategy includes only the following elements:
strategy :
standard :
verify :
tasks : []
analysis :
The verify property lets you reference one or
more tasks to execute to verify your deployment. If
configured, the verify tasks will run sequentially, immediately after the
'deploy' job.
The verify property is optional. If not specified, there will be no
verify job in the resulting rollouts.
The analysis stanza is optional, for use with
Cloud Deploy analysis .
You can omit the strategy element for a standard
deployment strategy.
Canary deployment strategy
The following sections describe configuration for a
canary deployment strategy, for
each runtime that Cloud Deploy supports.
For Cloud Run targets
strategy :
canary :
runtimeConfig :
cloudRun :
automaticTrafficControl : true | false
canaryDeployment :
percentages : [ PERCENTAGES ]
verify :
tasks : []
analysis :
For Cloud Run targets, AutomaticTrafficControl must be true
unless you're configuring a
custom canary .
For GKE and GKE attached clusters targets
The following YAML shows how to configure a deployment strategy for a target
that deploys to GKE or GKE attached clusters, using
service-based networking :
canary :
runtimeConfig :
kubernetes :
serviceNetworking :
service : " SERVICE_NAME "
deployment : " DEPLOYMENT_NAME "
disablePodOverprovisioning : true | false
canaryDeployment :
percentages : [ PERCENTAGES ]
verify :
tasks : []
The following YAML shows how to configure a deployment strategy for a target
that deploys to GKE or GKE attached clusters, using
Gateway API :
canary :
runtimeConfig :
kubernetes :
gatewayServiceMesh :
httpRoute : " HTTP_ROUTE_NAME "
service : " SERVICE_NAME "
deployment : " DEPLOYMENT_NAME "
routeUpdateWaitTime : " WAIT_TIME "
routeDestinations :
destinationIds : [ "KEY" ]
propagateService : [ true|false ]
canaryDeployment :
percentages : [ " PERCENTAGES " ]
verify :
tasks : []
Notice in this example
routeUpdateWaitTime . This
is included because Gateway API splits traffic using an HTTPRoute resource,
and sometimes there is a delay propagating changes made to the HTTPRoute . In
such cases requests may be dropped, because traffic is being sent to resources
that are unavailable. You can use routeUpdateWaitTime to cause
Cloud Deploy to wait after applying HTTPRoute changes, if you
observe this delay.
The following YAML shows how to configure a custom canary deployment strategy (for service networking , gateway api or Cloud Run )
or custom-automated canary deployment strategy (for service networking , gateway api or Cloud Run ). Runtime-specific configuration, in the runtimeConfig section, is omitted for custom canary, but included in
automated and custom automated canary configuration.
Custom Canary configuration
strategy :
canary :
# Runtime configs are configured as shown in the
# Canary Deployment Strategy section of this document.
runtimeConfig :
# Manual configuration for each canary phase
customCanaryDeployment :
- name : " PHASE1_NAME "
percent : PERCENTAGE1
profiles : [ " PROFILE1_NAME " ]
verify :
tasks : []
- …
- name : "stable"
percent : 100
profiles : [ " LAST_PROFILE_NAME " ]
analysis : [ ANALYSIS_CONFIGS ]
verify :
tasks : []
verify
The verify stanza can be included under strategy.standard ,
strategy.canary.canaryDeployment , or under each phase in
strategy.canary.customCanaryDeployment . It's used to enable
deployment verification for a target. This
stanza is optional; if omitted, no verification is performed for the rollout or
canary phase.
You can configure verify in either of two ways:
Set verify: true .
If you do this, you must also configure a verify stanza in your
skaffold.yaml , as described in
Configure Skaffold for verification .
Configure verify using one or more tasks to run for
verification:
verify :
tasks : [ VERIFY_TASKS ]
analysis
Deploy analysis, which you can use to run one or more checks against
Google Cloud Observability alerts, is configured inside a strategy stanza. See
Analysis definitions for configuration details.
deployParameters
Lets you specify key value pairs to pass values to manifests for
label-matched targets, when using deploy parameters .
You can also include this on targets .
Deploy parameters set on a delivery pipeline use labels to match targets:
deployParameters :
- values :
someKey : "value1"
matchTargetLabels :
label1 : firstLabel
- values :
someKey : "value2"
matchTargetLabels :
label2 : secondLabel
In this example, there are two values provided for the key, and for each value,
there is a label. The value is applied to the manifest for any target that has a
matching label.
predeploy and postdeploy jobs
Predeploy and postdeploy hooks are jobs to run before or after the deploy job
in a rollout. You can define predeploy and postdeploy hooks in either of two
ways:
Configure tasks
Reference reference custom actions .
Predeploy jobs run immediately before the deploy job in a rollout. Postdeploy
jobs run after all other jobs in the rollout, including verify and analysis, if
applicable.
Deploy hooks are configured under strategy.standard or
strategy.canary as follows:
Using tasks
serialPipeline :
stages :
- targetId :
strategy :
standard :
predeploy :
tasks : [ PREDEPLOY_TASKS ]
postdeploy :
tasks : [ POSTDEPLOY_TASKS ]
Where:
PREDEPLOY_TASKS are one or more Tasks
you want to run in your predeploy hook.
POSTDEPLOY_TASKS are one or more Tasks
you want to run in your postdeploy hook.
Using actions (and Skaffold)
serialPipeline :
stages :
- targetId :
strategy :
standard :
predeploy :
actions : [ ACTION_NAME ]
postdeploy :
actions : [ ACTION_NAME ]
Where ACTION_NAME is the name configured in skaffold.yaml for
customActions.name .
You can configure predeploy and postdeploy jobs under any strategy
( standard , canary , for example).
For more information about configuring and using pre- and post-deploy hooks,
see Run hooks before and after deploying .
Target definitions
The delivery pipeline definition file can contain target definitions, or you can
specify targets in a separate file.
You can reuse targets among multiple delivery pipelines. However, you can only
reference a target once from within a single delivery pipeline's progression.
See also: Custom target type definitions
For GKE targets
The following YAML shows how to configure a target that
deploys to a GKE cluster :
apiVersion : deploy . cloud . google . com / v1
kind : Target
metadata :
name :
annotations :
labels :
description :
deployParameters :

executionConfigs :
- usages :
- [ RENDER | PREDEPLOY | DEPLOY | VERIFY | POSTDEPLOY | ANALYSIS ]
workerPool :
serviceAccount :

metadata.name
The name of this target. This name must be unique per region.
metadata.annotations and metadata.labels
Target configuration supports Kubernetes annotations and labels ,
but Cloud Deploy does not require them.
Annotations and labels are stored with the target resource. For more information,
see Using labels and annotations with Cloud Deploy .
description
This field takes an arbitrary string that describes the use of this target.
deployParameters
You can include deploy parameters on any target,
along with values. Those values are assigned to the corresponding keys in your
manifest, after rendering.
The deployParameters stanza takes key-value pairs, as shown:
deployParameters :
someKey : "someValue"
someOtherKey : "someOtherValue"
If you set deploy parameters on a
multi-target , the value is assigned to
the manifest for all of that multi-target's
child targets .
multiTarget.targetIds: []
This property is optional, and is used to configure a
multi-target to be used for
parallel deployment .
The value is a comma-separated list of child targets .
Child targets are configured as normal targets, and don't include this
multiTarget property.
requireApproval
Whether promotion to this target requires manual approval. Can be true or
false .
This property is optional. The default is false .
When you configure parallel deployment , you can require
approval on the multi-target only—not on child targets.
gke
For GKE clusters only, the resource path identifying the
cluster where your application will be deployed:
gke :
cluster : projects/[project_name]/locations/[location]/clusters/[cluster_name]
project_name
The Google Cloud project in which the cluster lives.
location
The location where the cluster lives. For example, us-central1 . The cluster
can also be zonal ( us-central1-c ).
cluster_name
The name of the cluster, as it appears in your list of clusters in
Google Cloud console.
Here's an example:
gke :
cluster : projects/cd-demo-01/locations/us-central1/clusters/prod
Omit the gke property when configuring a multi-target .
The GKE cluster is configured instead inside the corresponding
child target.
See executionConfigs , in this document, for descriptions
of the execution environment properties. See
Deploy an HTTPRoute to a different cluster for information about deploying the HTTPRoute to an
alternate, non-target cluster.
associatedEntities.[KEY]
In a canary configuration, you use this name to reference the entities from
routeDestinations .
Learn more .
dnsEndpoint
When set to true , Cloud Deploy will connect to the
GKE cluster using the DNS endpoint instead of the default
endpoint, which may be a public IP, private IP, or the DNS endpoint, depending
on the cluster configuration.
This option cannot be used at the same time as the internalIp option.
internalIp
When set to true , Cloud Deploy will connect to the
GKE cluster using the private IP address instead of the
default endpoint, which may be a public IP, private IP, or the DNS endpoint,
depending on the cluster configuration.
This option cannot be used at the same time as the dnsEndpoint option. Because
network configuration for dnsEndpoint is much simpler, we recommend using
that instead .
proxyUrl
If you access clusters through an HTTP proxy, provide the proxyUrl
property here. The value is the URL of the proxy, which is
passed to kubectl
when connecting to your cluster.
For Cloud Run targets
The following YAML shows how to configure a target that
deploys to a Cloud Run service :
apiVersion : deploy . cloud . google . com / v1
kind : Target
metadata :
name :
annotations :
labels :
description :
multiTarget :
targetIds : []
requireApproval :
run :
location : projects /[ project_name ]/ locations /[ location ]
executionConfigs :
- usages :
- [ RENDER | PREDEPLOY| DEPLOY | VERIFY | POSTDEPLOY | ANALYSIS ]
workerPool :
serviceAccount :
artifactStorage :
executionTimeout :
verbose :
metadata.name
The name of this target. This name must be unique per region.
metadata.annotations and metadata.labels
Target configuration supports annotations and labels ,
but Cloud Deploy does not require them.
Annotations and labels are stored with the target resource. For more information,
see Using labels and annotations with Cloud Deploy .
description
This field takes an arbitrary string that describes the use of this target.
multiTarget.targetIds: []
This property is optional, and is used to configure a
multi-target to be used for
parallel deployment .
The value is a comma-separated list of child targets .
Child targets are configured as normal targets, and don't include this
multiTarget property.
requireApproval
Whether promotion to this target requires manual approval. Can be true or
false .
This property is optional. The default is false .
When you configure parallel deployment , you can require
approval on the multi-target only—not on child targets.
run
For Cloud Run services only, the location where the service
will be created:
run :
location : projects/[project_name]/locations/[location]
project_name
The Google Cloud project in which the service will live.
location
The location where the service will lives. For example, us-central1 .
Omit the run property when configuring a [multi-target]. The location of the
Cloud Run service is configured instead inside the
corresponding child target.
See executionConfigs , in this article, for descriptions
of the execution environment properties.
For GKE attached clusters targets
Target configuration for
deploying to GKE attached clusters is
similar to configuring a target for a
GKE target , except that the property
is anthosCluster.membership , instead of gke.cluster , the resource path is
different, and specific connection methods ( dnsEndpoint or
internalIp ) are not applicable.
anthosCluster :
membership : projects/[project_name]/locations/global/memberships/[membership_name]
project_name
The Google Cloud project in which the cluster lives.
/location/global/
The location where the cluster is registered. global , in all cases.
membership_name
The name of the cluster membership.
Here's an example:
anthosCluster :
membership : projects/cd-demo-01/locations/global/memberships/prod
Omit the anthosCluster property when configuring a [multi-target]. The cluster
is configured instead inside the corresponding child target.
For more information about deploying to GKE attached clusters, see
Deploy to GKE attached clusters .
For custom targets
Configuration for custom targets is similar to
all other target types, except that it does not include a gke stanza, nor a
run stanza, nor an anthosCluster stanza.
Instead, custom targets include a customTarget stanza:
customTarget :
customTargetType : [ CUSTOM_TARGET_TYPE_NAME ]
Where CUSTOM_TARGET_TYPE_NAME is the name you used in the
custom target type definition .
Here's an example:
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1
kind : Target
metadata :
name : sample-env
customTarget :
customTargetType : basic-custom-target
executionConfigs
A set of fields to specify a non-default execution environment
for this target.
Note: all configuration properties under executionConfigs are optional.
You don't need to specify an execution environment
if you can use the default worker pool, service account, and storage bucket.
usages
Either RENDER or DEPLOY or both, plus PREDEPLOY , VERIFY , or
POSTDEPLOY if verification or
deploy hooks are enabled on the target.
These indicate which of those operations to
perform for this target using this
execution environment. To indicate that a custom execution environment is to
be used for predeploy hook, render, deploy, postdeploy hook, and verification,
you would configure it as follows:
usages :
- RENDER
- PREDEPLOY
- DEPLOY
- VERIFY
- POSTDEPLOY
- ANALYSIS
If verification is enabled on the pipeline stage ,
and you don't specify VERIFY in a usages stanza, Cloud Deploy
uses the default execution environment for verification. Predeploy and
postdeploy hooks work the same way.
However, if there is a custom execution environment for RENDER and DEPLOY ,
you must specify one for VERIFY , PREDEPLOY , POSTDEPLOY , or ANALYSIS
if they're configured on the delivery pipeline. VERIFY , PREDEPLOY ,
POSTDEPLOY , and ANALYSIS can be in the same usages as RENDER or
DEPLOY , or in separate usages .
You can't specify usages.VERIFY , usages.PREDEPLOY , usages.POSTDEPLOY , or
usages.ANALYSIS unless RENDER and DEPLOY are specified in the same or
separate custom execution environments.
workerPool
Configuration for the worker pool to use. This takes a
resource path identifying the Cloud Build worker pool to use for
this target. For example:
projects/p123/locations/us-central1/workerPools/wp123 .
To use the default Cloud Build pool ,
omit this property.
A given target can have two workerPool s (one for RENDER and one for
DEPLOY ). When configuring the default pool, you can specify an alternate
service account or storage location or both.
serviceAccount
The name of the service account to use for this operation ( RENDER or
DEPLOY ) for this target.
artifactStorage
The Cloud Storage bucket to use for this operation ( RENDER or
DEPLOY ) for this target, instead of the default bucket.
executionTimeout
Optional. Sets the timeout, in seconds, for operations that Cloud Build
performs for Cloud Deploy. By default this is 3600 seconds (1
hour). Example: executionTimeout: "5000s"
verbose
Optional. If true , the verbosity levels are set to debug for the following
tools:
Skaffold --verbosity
is set to debug . Skaffold default is warn .
kubectl --v
is set to 4 , which is debug. The kubectl default is 2 .
Google Cloud CLI --verbosity is set
to debug . The default is warning .
Note: If you specify a configuration for either RENDER or DEPLOY, you must
do so for the other, even if one uses default values (only the usages:
property).
Alternative supported syntax
The executionConfigs configuration described in this document is new. The
previous syntax is still supported:
executionConfigs :
- privatePool :
workerPool :
serviceAccount :
artifactStorage :
usages :
- [ RENDER | DEPLOY ]
- defaultPool :
serviceAccount :
artifactStorage :
usages :
- [ RENDER | DEPLOY ]
When you're configuring an executionConfigs stanza for a
multi-target , each child target
can inherit that execution environment
from that multi-target.
Custom target type definitions
This section describes the fields used to define
custom target types
As with standard targets and automations, CustomTargetType definitions can be
included with your delivery pipeline definition, or in a separate file or files.
The following YAML shows how to configure a custom target type:
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1
kind : CustomTargetType
metadata :
name : [ CUSTOM_TARGET_TYPE_NAME ]
annotations :
labels :
description :
customActions :
renderAction : [ RENDER_ACTION_NAME ]
deployAction : [ DEPLOY_ACTION_NAME ]
includeSkaffoldModules :
- configs :
# either:
googleCloudStorage :
source :
path :
# or:
git :
repo :
path :
ref :
Where:
[CUSTOM_TARGET_TYPE_NAME]
Is an arbitrary name you give to this custom target type definition. This name
is referenced in the target definition for any target
that uses the custom target type you're defining.
[RENDER_ACTION_NAME]
Is the name of the custom render action. This value is the customAction.name
defined in skaffold.yaml .
[DEPLOY_ACTION_NAME]
Is the name of the custom deploy action. This value is the customAction.name
defined in skaffold.yaml .
For includeSkaffoldModules , see
Use remote Skaffold configs .
Automation definitions
This section describes the fields used to define the Cloud Deploy
automation resources.
As with targets, Automation definitions can be included with your delivery
pipeline definition, or in a separate file or files.
For more information about automation in Cloud Deploy, see the
automation documentation .
The following YAML shows how to configure an automation. Note that the specifics
of an automation rule are different per rule. (Configuration for the available
automation rule types is in the document
Using automation rules .)
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1
kind : Automation
metadata :
name : [ PIPELINE_NAME ] /[PURPOSE]
labels :
annotations :
description : [ DESCRIPTION ]
suspended : true | false
serviceAccount : [ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID ]
selector :
targets :
- id : [ TARGET_ID ]
labels :
[ LABEL_KEY ] :[LABEL_VALUE]
rules :
- [ RULE_TYPE ]:
id:[RULE_NAME]
[ RULE-SPECIFIC_CONFIG ]
Where:
[PIPELINE_NAME]
Is the same as the metadata.name value in the delivery pipeline that uses
this automation. All automations are exclusive to the delivery pipelines for
which they're created. That is, you can't share an automation across more
than one delivery pipeline.
[PURPOSE]
Is any further descriptive name for this automation. Typically, this would be
the action that's automated. For example, my-app-pipeline/promote .
labels and annotations are any labels or annotations you want to
associate with this automation.
[DESCRIPTION]
Is an optional description for this automation.
suspended
true or false , indicating whether this automation is active or suspended.
If set to true , the automation is not used. This can be useful for
testing an automation without affecting the delivery pipeline .
[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID]
Is the ID of the service account used to perform the
automation .
For example, if the automation uses the promoteReleaseRule , then this
service account performs the release promotion, and thus requires the
permissions that are needed
to promote a release.
A value is required for this property. Cloud Deploy doesn't use
the default service account
for automations.
This service account must have the following permissions:
actAs permission to impersonate the execution service account.
permission to perform the
operation being automated, for example, clouddeploy.releases.promote to
promote a release, or clouddeploy.rollouts.advance to advance a rollout
phase.
[TARGET_ID]
Is the ID of the target for which this automation is used. Although an
automation is tied to a delivery pipeline, it's only executed on the specified
target or targets.
You can set this to * to select all targets in the delivery pipeline.
[LABEL_KEY]:[LABEL_VALUE]
Is a key-value pair to match against a key-value pair defined on the target.
This select all targets associated with the delivery pipeline that have the
same label and value.
[RULE_TYPE]
Is the name of the automation rule used for this automation. This is either
promoteReleaseRule , timedPromoteReleaseRule , advanceRolloutRule , or
repairRolloutRule . You can include more than one rule in an automation,
including more than one of the same RULE_TYPE . For example, you can have
more than one promoteReleaseRule rule in the same automation.

[RULE_NAME]
A name for the rule. This name must be unique within the automation resource.
A value is required for this property.
[RULE-SPECIFIC_CONFIG]
Configuration is different for each supported automation type. Those
configurations are shown in
Using automation rules .
Deploy policy definitions
This section describes the fields used to define
deploy policies .
As with other Cloud Deploy resources, you can include DeployPolicy
definitions with your delivery pipeline definition or in a separate file.
The following YAML shows how to configure a deploy policy:
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1
kind : DeployPolicy
metadata :
name : [ POLICY_NAME ]
annotations : [ ANNOTATIONS ]
labels : [ LABELS ]
description : [ DESCRIPTION ]
suspended : [ true | false ]
selectors :
- deliveryPipeline :
id : [ PIPELINE_ID ]
labels :
[ LABEL_KEY ] :[LABEL_VALUE]
target :
id : [ TARGET_ID ]
labels :
[ LABEL_KEY ] :[LABEL_VALUE]
rules :
- [ RULE_TYPE ]
[ CONFIGS ]
Where:
[DESCRIPTION]
Is optional text describing this policy.
[POLICY_NAME]
A name for the policy. This field takes a string that must be unique per
project and location. This must be lower-case letters, numbers, and hyphens,
with the first character a letter, the last character a letter or a number,
and a 63-character maximum. This name is used as a display name in the
Google Cloud console.
[ANNOTATIONS] and [LABELS]
Policies can include annotations and labels, which are part of the policy
resource after it's created. For more information, see
Using annotations and labels with Cloud Deploy .
suspended: [true | false]
Setting suspended to true deactivates this policy.
[PIPELINE_ID]
Is the ID for the delivery pipeline you want this policy to affect. You can
use * to denote all pipelines. This ID is the same as the metadata.name
property on the delivery pipeline.
[TARGET_ID]
Is the ID for the target you want this policy to affect. You can use * to
denote all targets. This ID is the same as the metadata.name
property on the target.
[LABEL_KEY]:[LABEL_VALUE]
Is a key-value pair to match against a key-value pair defined on the delivery
pipeline or target. This selects all pipelines or targets that have the same
label and value. You can specify labels instead of or in addition to id .
[RULE_TYPE]
Is the specific policy rule type you're configuring. The only valid value is
rolloutRestriction .
[CONFIGS]
Is the set of configuration properties for the specific policy rule you're
creating. Configuration for rules is described
later in this section of this reference, for each of
the available rules.
Deploy policy rules
This section describes how to configure each deploy policy rule.
rolloutRestriction
The rolloutRestriction rule prevents Cloud Deploy from performing
certain operations on rollouts during the
time window or windows specified, for the delivery pipelines and targets
indicated by the selectors for the deploy policy.
The following YAML shows how to configure a rolloutRestriction rule:
rules :
- rolloutRestriction :
id : [ RULE_ID ]
actions :
- [ ACTIONS ]
invokers :
- [ INVOKERS ]
timeWindows :
timeZone : [ TIMEZONE ]
oneTimeWindows :
- start : [ START_DATE_TIME ]
end : [ END_DATE_TIME ]
weeklyWindows :
- daysOfWeek :
- [ DAY_OF_WEEK ]
- [ DAY_OF_WEEK ]
startTime : [ START_TIME ]
endTime : [ END_TIME ]
Where:
RULE_ID
An identifier for this rule. This is required. It must consist of lower-case
letters, numbers, and hyphens, with the first character a letter, the last
character a letter or a number, and a 63-character maximum. It must be unique
within the deploy policy.
ACTIONS
Optional: rollout actions to be restricted as part of the policy. If empty,
all actions are restricted. Valid values are:
ADVANCE
Rollout phases can't be
advanced .
APPROVE
Rollout promotion can't be approved.
CANCEL
Rollouts can't be canceled.
CREATE
Rollouts can't be created.
IGNORE_JOB
Jobs can't be ignored .
RETRY_JOB
Jobs can't be retried .
ROLLBACK
Rollouts can't be rolled back .
TERMINATE_JOBRUN
Job runs can't be terminated
INVOKERS
Specifying invokers will filter policy enforcement depending on whether the
action being restricted was invoked by a user or by a deploy automation. Valid
values are:
USER
The action is user-driven. For example, creating a rollout manually using a
gcloud CLI command.
DEPLOY_AUTOMATION
An automated action by Cloud Deploy.
You can specify either value or both values. The default, if you specify
nothing, is both.
TIMEZONE
The time zone, in
IANA format ,
in which you're expressing the time window. For example, America/New_York .
This is required.
START_DATE_TIME
For oneTimeWindows , the date and time that marks the beginning of the
restriction window, in the format "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm" . For the beginning of
the day, use 00:00 . This field is required.
END_DATE_TIME
For oneTimeWindows , the date and time that marks the end of the restriction
window, in the format "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm" . For the end of the day, use
24:00 . This field is required.
DAY_OF_WEEK
For weeklyWindows , the day of the week, SUNDAY , MONDAY , TUESDAY ,
WEDNESDAY , THURSDAY , FRIDAY , or SATURDAY . If you leave this blank, it
matches all days of the week
START_TIME
For weeklyWindows , the start time on the specified day of the week. If you
include a start time, you must include an end time. For the beginning of the
day, use 00:00 .
END_TIME
For weeklyWindows , the end time on the specified day of the week. If you
include a start time, you must include an end time. For the end of the day,
use 24:00 .
Analysis definitions
An analysis stanza lets you configure an analysis job
to run one or more checks against Google Cloud Observability alerts, or similar data from
other monitoring providers, in order to take actions based on those alerts.
The analysis stanza differs based on whether you're configuring it for
Google Cloud Observability or for a different provider using
custom analysis .
analysis for Google Cloud Observability
The analysis stanza can be used directly inside a deployment strategy
config ( strategy.standard.analysis , for a standard strategy). If you want to
configure analysis per phase, you use a custom canary
( strategy.canary.customCanaryDepolyment.phaseConfigs.phaseId.analysis ).
analysis :
duration : DURATION
googleCloud :
alertPolicyChecks :
- id : CHECK_ID
alertPolicies :
- ALERT_POLICY_NAME
labels :
LABEL_KEY : LABEL_VALUE
The following are the configuration properties for analysis , when using
Google Cloud Observability:
You can have any number of alertPolicyChecks .
DURATION is the amount of time, in seconds, minutes, or hours, to run the
analysis. After this time expires, the analysis is no longer affected by alerts
from Google Cloud Observability. For example: 200s .
CHECK_ID is a unique ID for the alert policy check. This is displayed in
the results of the analysis, for each check.
ALERT_POLICY_NAME is the name of the alert policy you created in
Google Cloud Observability.
LABEL_KEY is a label name for any labels your check will use to match
against the Google Cloud Observability alerting policy.
LABEL_VALUE is the value to match for each label.
Custom analysis
An analysis job that uses custom checks (against data from a monitoring provider
other than Google Cloud Observability). A custom check uses a
task to specify the container that includes the custom
behavior, and the command or commands to run on that container.
Configuration for a custom analysis is as follows:
analysis :
duration : DURATION
customChecks :
- id : CHECK_ID
frequency : FREQUENCY
task :
type : container
image : IMAGE_NAME
command : [ COMMAND ]
args : [ ARGS ]
env :
[ VAR : VALUE ]
DURATION is the amount of time, in seconds, minutes, or hours, to run the
analysis. After this time expires, the analysis is no longer affected by
incoming telemetry from your monitoring system. For example: 200s .
CHECK_ID is a unique ID you provide for the alert policy check. This is
displayed in the results of the analysis, for each check.
FREQUENCY specifies how often, in seconds, minutes, or hours, to run the
check. For example, 300s .
IMAGE_NAME is the path to the container image in an image repository.
COMMAND is the entrypoint to run on that container. " /bin/sh " is a
typical command to specify here, to invoke a shell, and you would include the
command or commands to run in that shell in the args.
ARGS is a list of arguments to provide to the command. If your COMMAND
is " /bin/sh ", then one of the arguments here would be " -c ", and another
argument would be the entire command you want to run in the shell you're
invoking.
