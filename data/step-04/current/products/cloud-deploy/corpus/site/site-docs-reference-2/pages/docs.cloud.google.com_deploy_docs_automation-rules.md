Using automation rules
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes automation rules, which are actions that can be taken
on your delivery pipeline automatically. For example, you can configure your
delivery pipeline so that promotion into a specific target happens
automatically, under the right circumstances.
You can only use automation rules that are built into Cloud Deploy.
The available automation rules are listed in this document.
Note: You can have a maximum of 250 automation rules per delivery pipeline.
Available automation rules
The following automation rules are available in Cloud Deploy:
Rule
Description
timedPromoteReleaseRule
Automatically promote from one target to the next
based on a cron schedule.
promoteReleaseRule
Automatically promotes a release into the indicated target after successful
rollout in the previous target in the progression.
advanceRolloutRule
Automatically advances a rollout from the indicated
phase to the next phase.
repairRolloutRule
Automatically retry the failed job or jobs in the rollout a
specified number of times, and roll back if all retries fail.
Configure automation rules
Configuration for each automation rule depends on the specific rule. This
section describes configuration that all rules have in common, as well as how
to configure each of the available rules.
Each automation rule is configured as part of the configuration for the
automation resource . This can be inside the
same file as configuration for the relevant delivery pipeline (usually called
clouddeploy.yaml ) or in any file you want. Learn more about
configuring automations .
The following sections describe configuration specific to individual automation
rules. See Automate your deployment
for configuration of the automation itself.
Configure a timedPromoteReleaseRule automation rule
The timedPromoteReleaseRule rule lets you schedule when to promote a release
from the selected target or targets to the next target in the progression, or to
a specified target. When you configure a timedPromoteReleaseRule automation,
you specify when to promote the release, based on a cron schedule.
rules :
- timedPromoteReleaseRule :
id : "[RULE_ID]"
schedule : "[CRON]"
timeZone : "[TIME_ZONE]"
destinationTargetId : "[TO_TARGET]"
destinationPhase : "[TO_PHASE]"
Where:
[RULE_ID]
Is any name you want to give to this rule. This name must be unique within the
automation resource.
[CRON]
Is the cron schedule that specifies when to promote the release. Use this
schedule to specify the date and time when you want to promote the release.
This schedule uses the standard cron syntax:
* * * * *
In this schedule...
The first position is the minute ( 0 - 59 ).
The second position is the hour ( 0 - 23 ).
The third position is the day of the month ( 1 - 31 ).
The fourth position is the month ( 1 - 12 ).
The fifth position is the day of the week ( 0 - 6 , Sunday to Saturday)
For example, if your timed-promote rule includes the following schedule:
0 9 * * 1 , your release is promoted every Monday at 9am.
You can also use standard cron schedule features, such as:
A range ( 0 - 5 )
A list ( 1 , 3 , 5 )
A step function (for example, */3 in the hours field activates every third
hour)
[TIME_ZONE]
Is the time zone you want to use for scheduling the promotion, in IANA format.
[TO_TARGET]
Is the targetId of the target to promote to, or @next to promote the
release automatically to the next target after the target specified in the
selector.targets property in this automation config. This is optional; the
default is @next .
[TO_PHASE]
Is the phase name of the phase
you want to promote to, for example canary-25 or stable . This property is
optional; if you omit it, the release is promoted to the first phase in the
target.
Configure a promoteReleaseRule automation rule
The promoteReleaseRule rule promotes your release after a successful rollout into
a target. For example, if you have three targets, you can set up this rule so
that when the release is successfully deployed into the first target, it's
automatically promoted to the second target.
Note: The service account configured in the automation (the "automation service
account") must have the clouddeploy.rollouts.create permission. The
automation service account must have iam.serviceAccount.actAs permission to
impersonate the Cloud Deploy
execution service account .
See IAM roles and permissions for more
information.
When you configure a promoteReleaseRule automation, you can specify either a
target to promote to ( destinationTargetId ) or @next . When the rollout
finishes successfully in target specified in the Automation definition, the
release is then promoted to the target specified in destinationTargetId ,
subject to a wait time interval.
You can also promote a release to a specific phase in the intended target, using
the destinationPhase property. The rules stanza shown here goes inside your
automation definition .
rules :
- promoteReleaseRule :
id : "[RULE_ID]"
wait : [ WAIT_TIME ]
destinationTargetId : "[TO_TARGET]"
destinationPhase : "[TO_PHASE]"
Where:
[RULE_ID]
Is any name you want to give to this rule. This name must be unique within the
automation resource.
[WAIT_TIME]
Is the amount of time, in minutes, to wait after the release is ready for
promotion before it's promoted. For example, 1m . The m is required.
The default value is 0 , or no wait time. The maximum is 20160m (or 14
days).
[TO_TARGET]
Is the targetId
of the target to promote to.
This can also be @next , which promotes the release automatically to the next
target after the target specified in the selector.targets property in this
automation config . This is the default if you
omit the value from destinationTargetId .
[TO_PHASE]
Is the phase name of the phase you want to promote to, for example canary-25
or stable . This property is optional; if you omit it, the release is
promoted to the first phase in the target.
Configure an advanceRolloutRule automation rule
The advanceRolloutRule advances your rollout, automatically, after successful
completion of one phase, into the next phase. This automation rule is useful for
canary deployments. For example, if you have a canary deployment strategy
configured on a target, with phases of 25% , 50% , and stable , you could
configure an automation rule that advances the phase automatically to stable
after the 50% phase finishes.
Note: The service account configured in the automation (the "automation service
account") must have the clouddeploy.rollouts.advance permission. The
automation service account must have iam.serviceAccount.actAs permission to
impersonate the Cloud Deploy
execution service account .
See IAM roles and permissions for more
information.
When you configure a advanceRolloutRule automation, you identify the phase to
advance from (the sourcePhase ). The rules stanza shown here goes inside
your automation definition .
rules :
- advanceRolloutRule :
id : "[RULE_ID]"
sourcePhases : [ "[START_PHASE]" , "[START_PHASE]" ... ]
wait : [ WAIT_TIME ]
Where:
[RULE_ID]
Is any name you want to give to this rule. This name must be unique within the
automation resource.
[WAIT_TIME]
Is the amount of time, in minutes, to wait to advance the rollout after the
rollout is ready. For example, 1m . The m is required.
The default value is 0 , or no wait time. The maximum is 20160m (or 14
days).
["[START_PHASE]", "[START_PHASE]"...]
Is the phase or phases from which the rollout is automatically advanced.
That is, when any of the phases listed finish successfully, the rollout is
automatically advanced from that phase to the next phase.
Phase names are case sensitive. Also, these phase names are optional; if you
omit sourcePhases , all phases in the rollout are automatically advanced.
Configure a repairRolloutRule automation rule
The repairRolloutRule rule retries a failed rollout a specified number of
times. If that number of retries is exhausted, this rule can then automatically
roll back the target to the last successful release.
When you configure a repairRolloutRule automation, you can specify how many
times to retry the rollout, and the wait time between retries. You can also
configure specific phases or jobs, or both, to retry. If each retry attempt
fails, the rollout fails. If any retry succeeds, the automation stops and the
rollout succeeds.
Optionally, you can configure the automation to roll back to the last successful
release on the target. Retries are also optional, but you need to have either
some number of retries or a rollback, or both.
The rules stanza shown here goes inside your
automation definition .
rules :
- repairRolloutRule :
id : "[RULE_ID]"
phases : [ PHASES_TO_REPAIR ]
jobs : [ JOBS_TO_REPAIR ]
repairPhases :
- retry :
attempts : [ NUMBER_OF_ATTEMPTS ]
wait : [ WAIT_TIME ]
backoffMode : [ LINEAR | EXPONENTIAL ]
- rollback :
destinationPhase : [ PHASE_NAME ]
disableRollbackIfRolloutPending : [ true | false ]
Where:
[RULE_ID]
Is any name you want to give to this rule. This name must be unique within the
automation resource.
[PHASES_TO_REPAIR]
Is the rollout phase or phases to retry. This is optional, and the default is
all phases in the rollout.
[JOBS_TO_REPAIR]
Is the job or jobs to retry. This is optional, and the default is all jobs.
[NUMBER_OF_ATTEMPTS]
Optional, the number of times to retry the rollout before considering it
failed.
[WAIT_TIME]
Is the amount of time to wait between retry attempts. For example, 1m for
a one-minutes interval. The time unit ( m in this case) is required.
If mode is linear , this interval is the same for each retry. If mode is
exponential , the interval increases each time. (See mode for further
description.)
backoffMode
LINEAR or EXPONENTIAL , indicating whether or not to increase the time
between retires. If LINEAR , the time between retries is constant, at
WAIT_TIME . If EXPONENTIAL , the time between retries doubles with each
successive retry. Default is LINEAR .
For example, if WAIT_TIME is 1m, and backoffMode is set to EXPONENTIAL ,
then the time between the failure and the first retry is 1 minute, the time
between the first and second retries is 2 minutes, and the time between the
second and third retries is 4 minutes.
rollback
Optional, whether or not to roll back the failed rollout after all retry
attempts are exhausted.
[PHASE_NAME]
Is the name of a specific phase you want to roll back to. If you omit
toPhase , the rollback defaults to the stable phase.
disableRollbackIfRolloutPending :
If set to true , the rollback operation is aborted if there's a pending
rollout on the target.
Abort a repairRolloutRule automation run
If you run any of the following commands on your rollout, the
repairRolloutRule automation is aborted:
Retry job
Cancel rollout
Ignore job
Terminate job run
Example
The following is an example of an automation configuration with a
repairRolloutRule :
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1
kind : Automation
metadata :
name : regular-repair/regular
description : repair regular rollouts
suspended : false
serviceAccount : (REDACTED)
selector :
targets :
- id : t1
rules :
- repairRolloutRule :
id : "repair-rollout"
repairPhases :
- retry :
attempts : 3
wait : 1m
backoffMode : LINEAR
- rollback :
destinationPhase : "stable"
In this automation, if a rollout fails on the identified target, that rollout is
retried up to 3 times, with a one-minute wait between retry attempt. If all
retry attempts fail, a rollback is started by creating a new rollout to deploy
the target's most recent successful release to that target.
