Deploy to multiple targets at the same time
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Using Cloud Deploy, you can deploy to a target that's configured to
represent multiple targets, and your application is deployed to those targets in
parallel (concurrently). The target you identify as a stage in your pipeline is
called a multi-target , and the targets
that multi-target comprises are called child targets .
You can use parallel deployment with any target type that
Cloud Deploy supports.
Why parallel deployment
You can use parallel deployment, for example, to deploy your application to
multiple production targets. In this case, you don't need to deploy to each
target in succession, because there's no progression (for example, from dev to
staging to production).
And this parallel deployment can be a part of a normal delivery pipeline
progression:
dev -> staging -> prod [prod1, prod2, prod3, prod4, ...] .
Note: you can use parallel deployment for any stage in your delivery pipeline.
Cloud Deploy resources used for parallel deployment
Parallel deployment uses the following Cloud Deploy specialized
resources:
multi-targets
A multi-target is a target that is configured with the property multiTarget ,
at the top level of the target config YAML, and instead of referencing the
runtime cluster or service, it references one or more other targets, using
multiTarget.targetIds .
Child targets
A child target is any target referenced by a multi-target as
multiTarget.targetIds .
Controller rollouts
A controller rollout is a rollout that corresponds to the multi-target.
See Limitations for more information about what you can and can't do with a controller rollout.
Child rollouts
See Limitations for more information about what you can and can't do with a child rollout.
Set up parallel deployment
Setting up parallel deployment consists of defining one multi-target and the
number of child targets you need (up to the limit ). Target
definitions are the same as for all targets, except for the following:
Multi-targets include the multiTarget property.
Child targets do not include the multiTarget property, but are referenced
from the multi-target using the multiTarget.targetIds property.
You can configure the multi-target for approval, but not the child targets,
which cannot include requireApproval:true .
Multi-targets and child targets can include custom
execution environment
configs. If a child target doesn't specify an execution environment, it inherits
the one defined in the multi-target definition, or the default. See
Execution environments and parallel deployment
for more details.
Configure the multi-target
A multi-target is a single target identified as a stage in your delivery
pipeline, but pointing to one or more child targets.
The multi-target configuration includes the multiTarget property. A
multi-target cannot have the gke or run or anthosCluster properties.
Configuration for a multi-target is the same regardless of which runtime you're
deploying to.
In your delivery pipeline YAML or in a separate YAML file, create the basic target definition, including multiTarget :
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1
kind : Target
metadata :
name : TARGET_NAME
description : TARGET_DESCRIPTION
multiTarget :
targetIds : [ CHILD_TARGET1 , CHILD_TARGET2 , CHILD_TARGETn ]
In this YAML...
TARGET_NAME is the name of this multi-target, which is
used in the delivery pipeline definition ,
stages.targetId property.
CHILD_TARGET1, CHILD_TARGET2,...CHILD_TARGETn are the
names of the child targets this multi-target deploys to. Each name corresponds
to the name property in the child target definition.
The presence of the multiTarget.targetIds property makes this target a
multi-target.
Configure the child targets
For each target identified as a child in your
multi-target configuration, configure another target, as a child target:
In your delivery pipeline YAML or in a separate
YAML file, create the basic target definition:
GKE
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1
kind : Target
metadata :
name : CHILD_TARGET1
description : TARGET_DESCRIPTION
gke :
cluster : projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /clusters/ CLUSTER_NAME
In this YAML...
CHILD_TARGET1 is the name of this child target. The
name corresponds to one member in the list of targets in the
multiTarget.targetIds property in the multi-target definition .
The value of the gke.cluster property is the resource name of the cluster
this target refers to, including the project ID, the region, and the cluster
name.
This target is configured the same as a standard GKE target.
The only thing that makes this a child target is that its referenced by the
multiTarget.targetIds property in the multi-target.
Cloud Run
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1
kind : Target
metadata :
name : CHILD_TARGET1
description : TARGET_DESCRIPTION
run :
location : projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION
In this YAML...
CHILD_TARGET1 is the name of this child target. The
name corresponds to one member in the list of targets in the
multiTarget.targetIds property in the multi-target definition .
The value of the run.location property is the resource name of the
Cloud Run service this target refers to, including the
project ID and the region.
This target is configured the same as a standard Cloud Run
target. The only thing that makes this a child target is that its referenced
by the multiTarget.targetIds property in the multi-target.
GKE attached clusters
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1
kind : Target
metadata :
name : CHILD_TARGET1
description : TARGET_DESCRIPTION
anthosCluster :
membership : projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/memberships/ MEMBERSHIP_NAME
In this YAML...
CHILD_TARGET1 is the name of this child target. The
name corresponds to one member in the list of targets in the
multiTarget.targetIds property in the multi-target definition .
MEMBERSHIP_NAME is the name that you chose when you
registered the cluster
to a fleet.
Custom Target
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1
kind : Target
metadata :
name : CHILD_TARGET1
description : TARGET_DESCRIPTION
customTarget :
customTargetType : CUSTOM_TARGET_TYPE_NAME
In this YAML...
CHILD_TARGET1 is the name of this child target. The
name corresponds to one member in the list of targets in the
multiTarget.targetIds property in the multi-target definition .
CUSTOM_TARGET_TYPE_NAME is the name of the
custom target type
used by this target.
Pass deploy parameters to targets
You can differentiate among child targets by including parameters in your
manifest and values in your delivery pipeline definition. Those values can be
applied separately to the
separate manifests, based on label matching on the corresponding targets.
For example, you might want a different number of replicas for each child
target. To do so, you would include the parameters and values in the delivery
pipeline's progression , along with
labels on the child targets to match for each parameter-value pair.
Learn more about deploy parameters .
Create the release
With a multi-target and child targets configured,
create the delivery pipeline and target resources ,
and then create a release, as normal.
The lifecycle of the delivery pipeline is the same as with any
Cloud Deploy pipeline and targets, except that when it gets to the
stage with the multi-target, Cloud Deploy creates a controller
rollout for the multi-target and a child rollout to deploy the application to
each child target.
Pub/Sub messages in response to Cloud Deploy operations
distinguish between controller rollouts and child rollouts.
Limitations
A multi-target can have no more than 100 child targets.
All child targets of a single multi-target must have the same target runtime
(all GKE or all Cloud Run, for example).
Within a delivery pipeline, a child target can have only one parent
multi-target.
A multi-target can't be childless, and it can't reference itself or another
multi-target as child targets.
You can't use a child target more than once within a single delivery pipeline,
but you can re-use them in different pipeline.
If the child targets are Custom Targets ,
they must all reference the same CustomTargetType .
Default pools have
concurrency limits, but private pools don't.
When you deploy to a multi-target, all child rollouts are deployed at the same
time, up to the Cloud Build concurrency limit. If you have more child targets than that
limit, the deploy jobs for some targets won't run until others finish, which
means that Cloud Deploy doesn't deploy to all child targets at the
same time, in this case.
Additionally, if the targets include verify jobs ,
it's possible for one or more of those verify jobs to start before the
application has been deployed to all child targets.
If you need to be able to deploy concurrently to more targets than the limit
specified in the Cloud Build documentation , you
have two options:
Request an increase of the number of
concurrent builds you can run.
Set up a private pool and
configure your targets to use that pool .
Execution environments and parallel deployment
Each target can be configured to use a non-default execution environment.
If the multi-target has a non-default execution environment, all child targets
using the default execution environment, inherit the non-default one from the
multi-target
If the multi-target uses the default execution environment, any child target
that is configured with a non-default execution environment uses that
non-default one.
These rules make it easier to propagate execution environments to child targets
from a multi-target, so you don't have to define or change the execution
environment for each child target, while still allowing you to customize the
execution environment for one or more child targets if you need to do so.
See Using Cloud Deploy execution environments
for more information about execution environments in Cloud Deploy.
Roll back a parallel deployment
If you need to roll back a deployment from multiple, parallel targets,
Roll back the multi-target, as described in
Roll back a target .
Approvals for parallel deployment
As with any targets, you can configure your parallel deployment to require
approvals .
With parallel deployment, however, you can only configure approval on the
multi-target. The approval or rejection affects all child targets together.
View parallel deployment in Google Cloud console
You can view details for your multi-target, child targets, the controller
rollout, and child rollouts in Google Cloud console.
When you view the list of targets for a given delivery pipeline, in the Delivery
Pipeline Details, the multi-target is listed, but child targets aren't.
When you view release details, however, you can see the controller rollout and
the child rollouts. You can also see controller and child rollouts listed on the
Rollouts tab on the Delivery Pipeline details page.
In the release inspector , you can view, and diff,
rendered manifests for child rollouts.
Use parallel deployment with a deployment strategy
You can deploy in parallel when you're using a
canary deployment strategy . See
Use parallel deployment with a canary deployment strategy
for more information.
