Pass parameters to your deployment
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Using Cloud Deploy, you can pass parameters for your release, and those
values are provided to the manifest or manifests before those manifests are
applied to their respective targets. This substitution is done after manifests
are rendered , as the final step in the
Cloud Deploy render operation. Values are provided to all manifests
identified in your skaffold.yaml file that contain the corresponding
placeholders.
All you need to do is include placeholders in your manifest, and set the values
for those placeholder in either your Cloud Deploy delivery pipeline
or target configuration, or when you create a release.
This article describes how to make that happen.
Why use deploy parameters?
A typical use for this would be to apply different values to manifests for
different targets in a parallel deployment . But you can
use deploy parameters for anything that requires post-render key-value pair
substitution in your manifest.
How it works
The following steps describe the general process for configuring deploy
parameters and providing values:
You configure deploy parameterization, as described
here .
This includes the following:
Add the placeholders to your manifest, including a default value for each.
Add values for those placeholders.
There are three ways to do this, described here .
When you create a release, your manifest is
rendered .
If you start with a templated manifest, values are applied now for template
variables. If you start with a raw manifest, it remains unchanged. This
rendering is done by Skaffold .
However, you can have additional variables in your manifest for which values
aren't applied at render time. These are the deploy parameters described
in this document.
At release creation, all deploy parameters are compiled into a
dictionary , which is used to substitute values before the
manifests are applied.
Note: If a given deploy parameter (key) is assigned more than one value, the
release fails.
After rendering, Cloud Deploy substitutes values for deploy
parameters.
These are the values you configured in the first step.
The rendering process already applied values to manifest templates,
replacing some values, and adding labels specific to
Cloud Deploy. But the values for these deploy parameters are
substituted after rendering. The differences between manifest templates and
deploy parameters are described
here .
The manifest is applied to the target runtime, to deploy your application.
This includes the values substituted at render time, and the values for any
deploy parameters
Different ways to pass values
You can provide parameters, and values for those parameters in three ways:
In the delivery pipeline definition
You provide the parameter and its value in the definition for a stage in the
delivery pipeline progression. The parameter is passed to the target
represented by that stage. If that stage references a multi-target, the
values set here are used for all child targets.
This method lets you replace a value for all releases within a given pipeline,
for all affected targets. The parameters defined for a stage identify a label,
and the corresponding target for that stage must have a matching label.
In the target definition
You configure the parameter and its value in the definition for the target
itself. This method lets you replace a value for that target for all releases.
On the command line , when you create a release
You include the parameter and its value using the --deploy-parameters flag
on the gcloud deploy releases create command.
This method lets you replace a value at release creation time, applying that
value to that manifests of all affected targets.
Configuration for these is explained in more detail
here .
Can I use more than one of these methods?
Yes, you can include deploy parameters in the pipeline stage, in the target
config, and on the command line. The result is that all the parameters are
accepted and added to the dictionary. However, if a specific parameter is passed
in more than one place, but with different values, the gcloud deploy releases
create command fails with an error.
How is this different from manifest templates
Deploy parameters, as described in this article, are distinguished from
placeholders in a templated manifest by the syntax . But
if you're wondering why you would need deploy parameters instead of just using
the standard techniques for templated manifests, the following table shows the
different purposes:
Technique
Substitution time

Specific release; specific target
On command line
Post-rendering
Specific release; all targets
On delivery pipeline
Post-rendering
All releases; specific targets (by label)
On target
Post-rendering
All releases; specific target
This document is about deploy parameters only (on command line, pipeline, and
target), not
templated manifests .
Limitations
For each type of parameter , you can create a maximum of 50
parameters.
A child target can additionally inherit up to 50 parameters from its parent
multi-target, up to a maximum of 200 parameters on the targets, including those
set on the pipeline stage.
The key name is limited to a maximum of 63 characters, and the following
regular expression:
^ [ a - zA - Z0 - 9 ]([ - A - Za - z0 - 9 _ . ]{ 0 , 61 }[ a - zA - Z0 - 9 ]) ? $
One exception to this is when you're using a deploy parameter as an
environment variable in a custom target, you must use a slash between the
keyword customTarget and the variable name ( customTarget/VAR_NAME ). See
Required inputs and outputs
for the supported syntax.
The prefix CLOUD_DEPLOY_ is reserved, and cannot be used for a key name.
You can't have two keys of the same name applied to the same target.
The value can be empty, but has a maximum of 512 characters.
Deploy Parameters placeholders can't be used for
Helm configuration values ,
but must be passed by convention .
Configure deploy parameters
This section describes how to configure deploy parameter values that will be
applied to your Kubernetes manifest, your Cloud Run service,
or your Helm template.
Besides configuring those key-value pairs, you need to add the placeholder or
placeholders to your manifest, as described in this section.
Add placeholders to your manifest
In your Kubernetes manifest (for GKE) or service YAML
(for Cloud Run), you add placeholders for any values you want
to substitute after rendering.
Syntax
For releases that aren't using the Helm renderer with
Skaffold, use the following syntax for your placeholders:
[ PROPERTY ] : [ DEFAULT_VALUE ] # from-param: ${VAR_NAME}
In this line...
PROPERTY:
Is the configuration property in your Kubernetes manifest or
Cloud Run service YAML.
DEFAULT_VALUE
Is a value to use if there are no values provided for this property on the
command line or in the pipeline or target config. The default value is
required, but it can be an empty string ( "" ).
# from-param:
Uses a comment character to set off the Cloud Deploy
deploy-parameters directive, and from-param: tells
Cloud Deploy that a deploy-parameters placeholder follows.
${VAR_NAME}
Is the placeholder to substitute. This must match the key of a key-value pair
provided in the delivery pipeline or target config, or upon release creation.
You can also use multiple parameters in a single line, and use the parameters as
part of a longer string, for example:
image : my-image # from-param: ${artifactRegion}-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/my-image@sha256:${imageSha}
These parameters can come from multiple sources. In the previous example,
${artifactRegion} would probably be defined on the target or delivery pipeline
stage, whereas ${imageSha} would come from the command line at release
creation time.
Parameters for Helm chart values
If you are rendering a Helm chart that accepts
configuration values ,
and you want to set those values using deploy parameters, the deploy parameters
must have names that match the Helm configurations values that you want to set.
All deploy parameters are passed to Helm as --set arguments at render time,
with no modification of your skaffold.yaml required.
For example, if your skaffold.yaml is installing a Helm chart that takes a
configuration parameter of webserver.port to specify which port the web server
would be starting on, and you want to set this dynamically from a deploy
parameter, you would need to create a deploy parameter with the
name webserver.port with the value you want for the web server port.
Therefore if you are not only referencing Helm templates in your skaffold.yaml ,
but also authoring them, you can utilise the
standard Helm variable syntax
of {{ .Values.VAR_NAME }} in your Helm templates.
For example, if we have a deploy parameter of webserver.port configured,
we could utilise it like so:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : webserver
spec :
replicas : 3
selector :
matchLabels :
app : webserver
template :
metadata :
labels :
app : webserver
spec :
containers :
- name : webserver
image : gcr.io/example/webserver:latest
ports :
- containerPort : {{ .Values.webserver.port }} # replaced by deploy parameter `webserver.port`.
name : web
env :
- name : WEBSERVER_PORT
value : {{ .Values.webserver.port }} # replaced by deploy parameter `webserver.port`.
Add a parameter to the pipeline stage
You can add key-value pairs to a stage in the delivery pipeline progression.
This is useful for parallel deployments , to distinguish
among child targets.
Add the placeholders to your Kubernetes manifest or Cloud Run
service, as described here .
Here's an example:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : nginx-deployment
labels :
app : nginx
spec :
replicas : 1 # from-param: ${deploy_replicas}
selector :
matchLabels :
app : nginx
template :
metadata :
labels :
app : nginx
spec :
containers :
- name : nginx
image : nginx:1.14.2
ports :
- containerPort : 80
Configure your delivery pipeline to include deployParameters for the
applicable pipeline stage.
The following YAML is the configuration for a pipeline stage whose target is
a multi-target, which in this case has two child targets:
serialPipeline :
stages :
- targetId : dev
profiles : []
- targetId : prod # multi-target
profiles : []
deployParameters :
- values :
deploy_replicas : 1
log_level : "NOTICE"
matchTargetLabels : # optional, applies to all resources if unspecified; AND'd
my-app : "post-render-config-1"
- values :
deploy_replicas : 2
log_level : "WARNING"
matchTargetLabels : # optional, applies to all resources if unspecified; AND'd
my-app : "post-render-config-2"
In this delivery pipeline configuration, the deployParameters stanza
includes two values , each of which has the following:
The variable name, which is the same name as the variable you set in the
manifest
A value for that variable
One or more labels (optional) to match against target-specific labels
If you don't specify a label, in a matchTargetLabels stanza, that value
is used for all targets in the stage.
If you included matchTargetLabels , you also must
include labels on the targets , to match them. In this way, you
identify which value to assign to which child target.
The target must match all labels set in the values stanza.
If you omit matchTargetLabels , the values you set on the pipeline are
applied to all child targets. But if you set more than one value for the same
parameter, the release will fail.
After each manifest is rendered, Cloud Deploy adds the value for
each variable into the rendered manifest.
Add a parameter to the target configuration
You can add key-value pairs to a target. If you're using deploy parameters to
distinguish among multiple child targets, configure them on those child targets,
not on the multi-target.
Configure your Kubernetes manifest or
Cloud Run service definition using a parameter in place of the value
you want to set at deploy time.
Here's an example:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : nginx-deployment
labels :
app : nginx
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
app : nginx
template :
metadata :
labels :
app : nginx
spec :
containers :
- name : nginx
image : nginx:1.14.2
env :
- name : envvar1
value : example1 # from-param: ${application_env1}
- name : envvar2
value : example2 # from-param: ${application_env2}
In this manifest, the parameter envvar1 is set to a default of example1 ,
and envvar2 is set to a default of example2 .
Configure your targets to include
deployParameters .
For each parameter you're including, you identify the following:
The key name, which is the same name as the key (variable) you set in the
manifest.
A value for that key. If you don't provide a value, the default value set
in the manifest is used.
The following YAML is the configuration for two targets. Each target includes
a deployParameters stanza setting a value. Each target also includes a
label, to be matched with deploy parameters
configured on a pipeline stage .
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : Target
metadata :
name : prod1
labels :
my-app : "post-render-config-1"
description : development cluster
deployParameters :
application_env1 : "newValue1"
---
apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : target
metadata :
name : prod2
labels :
my-app : "post-render-config-2"
description : development cluster
deployParameters :
application_env1 : "newValue2"
When the release is created, but after the manifests are rendered,
Cloud Deploy adds these values to the rendered manifests if they
include the associated keys.
Pass a parameter at release creation
Follow these steps to pass parameters and values to the release:
Configure your Kubernetes manifest or
Cloud Run service definition using a parameter in place of the
value you want to set at deploy time.
Here's an example:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : nginx-deployment
labels :
app : nginx
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
app : nginx
template :
metadata :
labels :
app : nginx
annotations :
commit : defaultShaValue # from-param: ${git-sha}
spec :
containers :
- name : nginx
image : nginx:1.14.2
In this example, the commit SHA is set as a variable called ${git-sha} .
A value for this is passed at release creation, using the
--deploy-parameters= option, as seen in the next step.
Syntax for this variable is $ plus the variable name in braces. In this
example, it's ${git-sha} .
When you create a release, include the --deploy-parameters option on the
gcloud deploy releases create command.
--deploy-parameters takes a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, where
the key is the placeholder you added to the manifest .
The command will look similar to this:
gcloud deploy releases create test - release - 001 \
--project=my-example-project \
--region=us-central1 \
--delivery-pipeline=my-params-demo-app-1 \
--images=my-app-image=gcr.io/google-containers/nginx@sha256:f49a843c290594dcf4d193535d1f4ba8af7d56cea2cf79d1e9554f077f1e7aaa \
--deploy-parameters="git-sha=f787cac"
When the release is created, but after manifest rendering,
Cloud Deploy provides the values to the rendered manifests if they
include the associated keys.
Deploy parameters with custom targets
You can use any deploy parameter as an environment variable in
custom targets . When doing so, use the
syntax specified for
custom targets.
Deploy parameters intended as inputs for custom targets can start with
customTarget/ , for example customTarget/vertexAIModel . If you use this
prefix, use the following syntax when you reference a deploy parameter as an
environment variable:
CLOUD_DEPLOY_customTarget_ [ VAR_NAME ]
Where VAR_NAME is the name following the slash in the
deploy parameter name. For example, if you define a
deploy parameter named customTarget/vertexAIModel , reference it as
CLOUD_DEPLOY_customTarget_vertexAIModel .
Deploy parameters with deploy hooks
You can use any deploy parameter as an environment variable in
deploy hooks .
Deploy parameters with deployment verification
You can use any deploy parameter as an environment variable in
deployment verification .
View all parameters for a release
You can view the parameters that have been set for a given release. They're
displayed in a table on the Release details page and on the command line
( gcloud deploy releases describe ).
From the main Cloud Deploy page, click the delivery pipeline that
includes the release you want to see.
On the Release details page, select the Artifacts tab.
All deploy parameters that have been set for this release are shown in a table,
with the variable name and value in one column, and the affected target or
targets in the other column.
