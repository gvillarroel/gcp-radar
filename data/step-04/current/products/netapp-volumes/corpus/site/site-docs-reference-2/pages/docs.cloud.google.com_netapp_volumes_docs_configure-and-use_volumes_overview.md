Volumes overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides an overview of the volumes feature of
Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. The volume instructions provided on this page don't
apply to Flex Unified ONTAP-mode. You can't create, view, update, or delete
ONTAP-mode volumes using the Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI. For more
information about ONTAP-mode instructions, see
ONTAP-mode .
About volumes
A volume is a file system container in a storage pool that stores application,
database, and user data.
You create a volume's capacity using the available capacity in the storage pool
and you can define and resize the capacity without disruption to your processes.
Storage pool settings apply to the volumes contained within them automatically.
These settings include the service level, location, network (Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)),
Active Directory policy, LDAP, and the customer-managed encryption key (CMEK)
policy. Also, to use auto-tiering on a volume, you must enable it on the pool.
For ONTAP-mode, you must configure Active Directory policy and LDAP settings
directly in ONTAP, not at the storage pool level.
Volume performance
Flex Unified and Flex File with custom performance storage pools : the
performance of a volume depends on the performance configured on its storage
pool. The pool performance is shared between all volumes in the pool.
Flex File storage pools with default performance : the performance of a
volume depends on the size and capabilities of its storage pool. The pool
performance is shared between all volumes in the pool.
Standard storage pools : the volume's performance is defined by the volume
size and the service level it inherits from the pool. Every GiB of volume
capacity adds 16 KiBps of throughput. The volume size can be increased or
decreased to optimize performance.
Premium and Extreme storage pools : the volume's performance is defined by
the volume size and the service level it inherits from the pool. Every GiB of
volume capacity adds 64 KiBps or 128 KiBps of throughput. The volume size can be
increased or decreased to optimize performance. Additionally, you can move a
volume non-disruptively between Premium and Extreme pools to optimize
performance.
Space provisioning
Volumes must have enough capacity to store your data, including future growth.
Depending on how much data you add each day and how quickly your organizational
processes let you increase a volume's size, plan for enough headroom.
If a volume becomes full, clients receive an out of space error when they try
to modify or add data, which can lead to problems for your applications or
users. You should monitor usage of your volumes and maintain a provisioned space
buffer of 20% above your expected volume utilization. For more information about
monitoring usage, see Monitor NetApp Volumes .
Snapshots consume the volume's capacity. When snapshots exist, you might delete
data, but the volume's space utilization doesn't decrease. This happens because
the data in your active file system counts toward a snapshot, which also
contributes to the volume's used capacity. Space becomes available only after
you delete the last snapshot that contains that data. For more information, see
Snapshot space use .
For Standard, Premium, and Extreme service levels, the size of the volume also
determines the allocated throughput capability. For more information, see
Standard, Premium, and Extreme performance .
Volume user and group quotas
For the Standard, Premium, Extreme, and Flex Unified default-mode service
levels, you can limit volume space used by specific users or groups. Note that
these are different from Google Cloud Quotas and system limits. You set
user and group quotas directly on a NetApp Volumes volume. For
more information about quota rules, see Manage quota rules .
For ONTAP-mode, quotas must be defined at the ONTAP level. Google tools don't
support quota management for ONTAP-mode pools.
Quotas can be set for individual Windows or Unix users, or Unix groups, but not
for Windows groups. Quotas target the specific user IDs (UID),
security identifier (SID), or group IDs (GID) for the user or group, not the
name.
Quotas are intended to limit usage, not to allocate storage for a user's usage.
Quota limits are checked in sequential order, starting with user quotas and then
group quotas. When quota limits are reached, writes are blocked. Group quotas
are shared by all users in the group. For more information about how to manage
quota rules, see
Manage quota rules .
Warning: If you decide to use both user and group quotas together, writes will
be blocked if any limit is reached.
For example, three groups HR, Finance, and Management share a 10 TiB
volume. The default group quota is 500 GiB which limits HR and Management
group users, and Finance has a 10 TiB group quota. The default user quota
is 1 TiB. Users Sasha in Finance and Alex in Management are assigned an
individual user quota of 5 TiB. The following are some examples of the
effective quota for specific users:
Users Kim in HR, Taylor, and Alex in Management are limited to a 500 GiB
group quota. Alex's 5 TiB user quota is effectively overridden by the
group quota.
User Sasha in Finance is limited by the user quota to 5 TiB.
User Lee in Finance is limited by the user quota to 1 TiB.
No one in Finance has a user quota greater than 5 TiB, thus none can
individually store up to the 10 TiB group quota.
When users try to write beyond the quota limit, they will receive an error.
User quota consumption and limits are visible to the user in Windows Explorer
or Linux quota command. The group quota consumption and limits are only visible
when using an rquota v2 compatible client.
There are four types of quota rules:
Individual user quota : applies to explicit user using Linux UID or Windows
SID
Individual group quota : applies to explicit group using Linux GID without
Windows support
Default user quota : applies to every user without an individual quota rule
Default group quota : applies to every group without an individual quota
rule
Volume reversion
NetApp Volumes lets you revert volumes to a previously created
snapshot. When you revert a volume, it restores all volume contents back to
the point in time the snapshot was taken. Any snapshot created after the
snapshot used for the reversion is lost. If you don't want to lose data,
we recommend that you clone a volume or restore data with snapshots instead.
You can use volume reversion to test and upgrade applications or fend off
ransomware attacks. The process is similar to overwriting the volume with a
backup, but only takes a few seconds. You can revert a volume to a snapshot
independent of the capacity of the volume.
Reversions happen when the volume is online and in use by clients. We
recommend stopping all critical applications before you revert to avoid
potential data corruption because the reversion changes open files without
any notification to the application.
Block volume from deletion when clients are connected
NetApp Volumes lets you block the deletion of volumes when they
are mounted by a client. If you use volumes for Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE)
datastores, you must enable the setting to block the deletion of volumes when
clients have mounted volumes. If you enable Block volume from deletion when
clients are connected setting, an error message displays when you try to
delete a mounted volume.
Volumes support blocking the deletion of volumes when you create a volume,
create a new volume from a snapshot, and create a new volume from a backup.
The following protocols support blocking the deletion of volumes:
NFSV3
NFSV4.1
NFSV3 and NFSV4.1
To delete a volume when this option is enabled, all the clients must first
unmount the volume. After that, you must wait for more than 52 hours to delete
the volume.
Large capacity volumes
Note: The large capacity volumes feature is available in allow-listed
General Availability (GA) for Premium and Extreme service levels, and in Preview
for Flex Unified service level. To request access to this feature, contact
sales .
Premium and Extreme service levels allow volume sizes between 100 GiB and
102,400 GiB and maximum throughput of up to 4.5 GiBps. The Flex
Unified service level supports volume sizes between 1 GiB and 300 TiB and
maximum throughput of up to 5 GiBps. Some workloads require larger volumes and
higher throughput, which can be achieved by using the large capacity volume
option for these service levels.
For Flex Unified, large capacity volumes can be sized between 2400 GiB and
2.5 PiB, or up to 20 PiB with auto-tiering, in increments of 1 GiB and deliver
throughput performance of up to 22 GiBps.
For Premium and Extreme service levels, the large capacity volumes can be sized
between 15 TiB and 3 PiB in increments of 1 GiB and deliver
throughput performance of up to 30 GiBps.
Large capacity volumes provide six storage endpoints (IP addresses) to
load-balance client traffic to the volume and deliver higher performance. These
volumes are ideal for workloads which require high performance and highly
concurrent access to the same data. For recommendations on how to connect your
clients, see Connect large capacity volumes with multiple storage endpoints .
Volumes can't be converted into large capacity volumes and the other way around
after creation.
The default quota for storage pools is 25 TiB per location. For most large
volumes, you need more capacity and must request a quota increase for the
Storage pool capacity (GiB) per location quota. For more information, see
NetApp Volumes quotas .
Auto-tiering
Google Cloud NetApp Volumes lets you enable auto-tiering on a per-volume basis if
auto-tiering is enabled on the storage pool. Auto-tiering reduces the overall
cost of volume usage by moving unused data to a cold data tier. For more
information about auto-tiering, see Manage auto-tiering .
