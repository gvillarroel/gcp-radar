Monitor NetApp Volumes
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to monitor Google Cloud NetApp Volumes resources and
performance by collecting and analyzing metrics with Cloud Monitoring.
Cloud Monitoring metrics
Various metrics for monitoring NetApp Volumes are available
within Cloud Monitoring . Categories include
volume, storage pool, and replication metrics.
You can select and chart individual metrics in
Metrics Explorer , create
a dashboard with multiple charts, add alerting, or retrieve the metrics data
with the Cloud Monitoring API.
Monitored resources
netapp.googleapis.com precedes each monitored resource. For example, for
Volume , the complete monitored resource is netapp.googleapis.com/volume .
Monitored resource
Resource metadata fields
Volume
labels service_level storage_pool protocols
StoragePool
labels service_level
Replication
service_level
BackupVault
backup_crypto_key_version
For Flex Unified ONTAP-mode, only the StoragePool resource is available. You
must monitor all other resources within ONTAP.
Resource metrics
netapp.googleapis.com precedes each metric. For example, the complete metric
for volume/bytes_used metric is netapp.googleapis.com/volume/bytes_used .
Metrics are sampled and pushed to Cloud Monitoring every five minutes.
In Cloud Monitoring Metrics Explorer, select a metric and use a minimum
alignment period of five minutes for accurate results.

int
Cloud Monitoring also lets you set up alerting if metrics meet certain
conditions. For example, you can use Cloud Monitoring to trigger
administrative notifications before space in a volume runs out. See
Cloud Monitoring alerting .
Track volume performance statistics with Cloud Monitoring
Cloud Monitoring tracks the following performance metrics per volume:
/volume/operation_count
/volume/throughput
/volume/average_latency
These metrics update every 5 minutes and provide an overview of
performance trends for periods of one day or longer.
The metrics only reflect the service performance. Consider using monitoring
tools available on the clients for more details. For example, the latency
observed on the client may be higher than that reported by the service if the
requests are queued up on the client before they are sent to the service.
