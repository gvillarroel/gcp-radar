This page describes how to connect NFS clients.
Before you begin
If you use a firewall to control network traffic and want to allow NFS traffic,
see Firewall rules for NFS volumes access .
Install NFS client tools based on your Linux distribution type to prepare your
client:
RedHat
Run the following command:
sudo yum i nstall - y nfs - u t ils
SuSe
Run the following command:
sudo yum i nstall - y nfs - u t ils
Debian
Run the following command:
sudo ap t - ge t i nstall nfs - commo n
Ubuntu
Run the following command:
sudo ap t - ge t i nstall nfs - commo n
Volume access control using export policies
Volume access control in NFSv3 and NFSv4.1 is based on the client's IP address.
The volume's export policy contains up to 20 export rules. Each rule is a
comma-separated list of IPs or network CIDRs which define Allowed Clients
enabled to mount the volume. A rule also defines the type of access the clients
have such as Read & Write or Read Only .
Use the following tabs to review policies based on NFS versions:
NFS without Kerberos
All NFS versions without Kerberos use the AUTH_SYS security flavor. In
this mode, you must tightly manage the export rules to allow only clients
you trust and which can ensure user ID and group ID integrity.
As a security measure, NFS servers automatically map NFS calls with UID=0
(root) to UID=65534 (anonymous), which has limited permissions on the file
system. For more information, see User ID squashing .
NFSv4.1 with Kerberos
NFSv4.1 with Kerberos use export policies and additional authentication using
Kerberos to access volumes. You can configure export rules to apply for the
following:
Kerberos only ( krb5 )
Kerberos signing ( krb5i )
Kerberos privacy ( krb5p )
Best practices for export policies
We recommend the following best practices for export policies:
Order the export rules from most specific to least specific.
Export only to the trusted clients, such as specific clients or CIDRs with
the trusted clients.
Limit the root access to a small group of trusted administration clients.
Rule
Allowed clients
Access
Root access
Description
1
10.10.5.3,
10.10.5.9
Read & Write
On
Administration clients. Root user stays root and can manage
all the file permissions.
2
10.10.5.0/24
Read & Write
Off
All other clients from 10.10.5.0/24 network are allowed to mount,
but root access gets mapped to nobody.
3
10.10.6.0/24
Read-Only
Off
Another network is allowed to read data from the volume, but
no writes.
After a client mounts a volume, the file level access determines what a user is
allowed to do. For more information, see NFS file-level access control for UNIX-style volumes .
Manage export policies
Use the following instructions to update a volume's export policy using the
Google Cloud CLI.
gcloud
Update a volume with one export policy
Update a volume with one export policy rule:
gcloud netapp volumes update VOLUME_ID \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = LOCATION \
--export-policy = access-type = ACCESS_TYPE ,allowed-clients = ALLOWED_CLIENTS_IP_ADDRESSES ,has-root-access = TRUE_OR_FALSE ,nfsv3 = NFSV3 ,nfsv4 = NFSV4
Replace the following information:
VOLUME_ID : the ID of the volume.
PROJECT_ID : the name of the project the volume is
in.
LOCATION : the location of the volume.
ACCESS_TYPE : the access type must be either one of
READ_WRITE , READ_ONLY , or READ_NONE .
ALLOWED_CLIENTS_IP_ADDRESSES : a list of allowed
clients IP addresses or ranges separated by comma.
NFSV3 : set to true or false to apply this rule
to NFSv3.
NFSV4 : set to true or false to apply this rule
to NFSv4.
Add multiple export policy rules
To add multiple export rules, repeat the export-policy parameter block.
Each export-policy parameter block consists of multiple key-value pairs in
the following format:
--export-policy=KEY1=VALUE1,KEY2=VALUE2,KEY3=VALUE3...
Example: Using a colon and comma as a separator
If you specify multiple IP addresses or CIDRs for allowed-clients ,
Google Cloud CLI might not parse values correctly because the --export-policy
flag uses commas as the default separator between different keys such as
access-type and nfsv3 . If a value, such as allowed-clients , also
contains commas, the parser can't distinguish between a new key-value pair
and an additional IP address within the allowed-clients list. To
distinguish these commas, configure Google Cloud CLI to use a
different parameter separator with Google Cloud CLI escaping .
The following command shows the example from
Best practices for export policies .
The first rule uses a colon as the parameter separator to correctly parse the
comma-separated allowed-clients list. The second and third rules use the
default comma as separator.
gcloud netapp volumes update my_volume --location=us-east4 \
--export-policy=^:^access-type=READ_WRITE:allowed-clients="10.10.5.3,10.10.5.9":nfsv3=true:nfsv4=true:has-root-access=true \
--export-policy=access-type=READ_WRITE,allowed-clients=10.0.5.0/24,nfsv3=true,has-root-access=false \
--export-policy=access-type=READ_ONLY,allowed-clients=10.0.6.0/24,nfsv3=true,has-root-access=false
Example: Using the squash-mode as a parameter
The following example uses the alternative squash-mode parameter to create
a NO_ROOT_SQUASH rule for administrator hosts and an ALL_SQUASH rule for
a CIDR range.
gcloud netapp volumes update my_volume --location=us-east4 \
--export-policy=^:^allowed-clients="10.10.5.3,10.10.5.9":nfsv3=true:access-type=READ_WRITE:squash-mode=NO_ROOT_SQUASH \
--export-policy=allowed-clients=10.0.2.0/24,nfsv3=true,access-type=READ_WRITE,squash-mode=ALL_SQUASH,anon-uid=2000
For more information about additional optional flags, see
Google Cloud SDK for volumes export policy .
User ID squashing
NFS export policies provide controls for user and group ID squashing , which lets you remap user and
group IDs to an anonymous user ID for security purposes.
Root squashing
NFS servers improve security by remapping the root user ( UID=0 ) to nobody
( UID=65534 ), which makes root an unprivileged user for file access on the
volume. This feature is known as root squashing . The option to disable it
and retain root's privileges is called no_root_squash on NFS servers.
By default, volumes without a defined export policy are inaccessible to client
IP addresses. When you create an export policy rule in the Google Cloud console, the
default settings include Read & Write access and root squash . The
Google Cloud API, Google Cloud CLI, and Terraform previously supported control
over root squashing using the has-root-access parameter. While
has-root-access is still accepted, it has been replaced by the squash-mode
parameter.
As a best practice, create a dedicated export rule that enables root access for
your trusted administrator hosts and disables root access for other clients.
Place this rule first, before more generic rules.
User and group ID squashing
The squash-mode parameter provides control over squashing both user and group
IDs to an anonymous UID, which can be useful for public SFTP dropbox
directories. This parameter also replaces the has-root-access parameter and is
supported across the API, Google Cloud CLI, and Terraform.
The squash-mode parameter accepts the following values:
no-root-squash : in this mode, the root user remains root and doesn't get
remapped to nobody ( UID=65534 ).
root-squash : this setting remaps the root user to nobody.
all-squash : this option provides anonymous access for all users, including
root. All users are remapped to the UID and GID specified by the anon-uid
parameter. When using all-squash , you must also specify anon-uid , and
set access-type to READ_WRITE .
Considerations
Consider the following for export policy rules with squash mode :
An export policy supports only one all-squash rule.
When all-squash is enabled, the root user is squashed to anonymous. This can
be overridden by a higher priority rule that uses no-root-squash .
Volume replication isn't supported for volumes with a squash-mode style
export policy rule.
For the Flex service level, all-squash doesn't change ownership of the
volume's root inode automatically. To achieve this, add a no-root-squash
export rule, allowing the root user to use chown to change ownership of the
root inode to the required UID.
The has-root-access parameter is supported. Use either has-root-access or
squash-mode ; don't use both parameters simultaneously.
Mount instructions for NFS clients
Use the following instructions to get mount instructions for NFS clients using
either the Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI or ONTAP-mode.
Console
Go to the NetApp Volumes page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to NetApp Volumes
Click Volumes .
Click more_vert Show more .
Select Mount instructions .
Follow the mount instructions shown in the Google Cloud console.
Identify the mount command and use the mount options unless your workload
has specific mount option requirements.
NFSv3 only : if your application doesn't use locks or you didn't
configure your clients to enable NSM communication, we recommend that you
add the nolock mount option.
gcloud
Look up the mount instructions for a volume:
gcloud netapp volumes describe VOLUME_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = LOCATION \
--format = "value(mountOptions.instructions)"
Replace the following information:
VOLUME_NAME : the name of the volume.
PROJECT_ID : the name of the project the volume
is in.
LOCATION : the location of the volume.
For more information about additional optional flags, see
Google Cloud SDK documentation on volumes .
ONTAP-mode
Use the following steps to identify your volume's hostname or IP address, and
the export path:
Look up all network interfaces
for the data_cifs service.
Determine the export path, which corresponds to the
junction path
you specified for your volume.
Create the mount path in the format
<var>IP</var>:<var>junction-path</var> . Add any required mount options.
After you identify the required commands, see ONTAP-mode
for instructions about how to submit ONTAP commands to the storage pool.
Additional NFSv4.1 instructions
When you enable NFSv4.1 for volumes of the Flex Unified, Standard, Premium, and
Extreme service levels, NFSv4.2 is automatically enabled for these volumes. The
Linux mount command always mounts the highest available NFS version, unless you
specify the version to mount. If you want to mount with NFSv4.1, use the
-o vers=4.1 parameter in your mount command.
In NFSv3, users and groups are identified by user IDs (UID) and group IDs (GID)
sent over the NFSv3 protocol. Its important to make sure that the same UID and
GID represent the same user and group on all clients accessing the volume. NFSv4
removed the need for explicit UID and GID mapping by using security identifiers.
Security identifiers are strings formatted as <username|groupname>@<full_qualified_domain> .
An example of a security identifier is bob@example.com .
The client needs to translate the UIDs and GIDs used internally into a security
identifier before sending an NFSv4 request to the server. The server needs to
translate the security identifiers into UIDs and GIDs for an incoming request
and the other way around for its response. The advantage of using translations
is that every client and the server can use different internal UIDs and GIDs.
However, the disadvantage is that all clients and the server need to maintain a
mapping list between UIDs and GIDs, and user and group names. The mapping
information on clients can come from local files like /etc/passwd and
/etc/groups or an LDAP directory. The configuration of this mapping is managed
by rpc.idmapd , which must run on your client.
On NetApp Volumes, the LDAP must provide mapping information,
with Active Directory being the only supported RFC2307bis compatible LDAP server.
When using Kerberos for NFSv4, the security identifier stores Kerberos
principals in the format username@DOMAINNAME , where DOMAINNAME (in capital
letters) becomes the realm name.
Numeric IDs
For users that don't want to configure the name mappings and instead use NFSv4
as a replacement for NFSv3, NFSv4 has introduced an option called numeric ID ,
which sends UID and GID encoded text strings as security identifiers. This
simplifies the configuration process for users.
Note: The latest Linux distributions enable numeric ID option by default.
You can check your client setting using the following command:
ca t /sys/module/ nfs /parame ters / nfs 4 _disable_idmappi n g
The default value is Y , which enables numeric IDs. NetApp Volumes
supports the use of numeric IDs.
Configure rpc.idmapd on NFS client
Regardless of the type of IDs or security identifiers you use, it is necessary
to configure rpc.idmapd on your NFS client. If you followed the installation
instructions for client utilities in the Before you begin
section, it should already be installed but might not be running. Some
distributions start it automatically using systemd when you mount the first
NFS volumes. The minimum configuration required for rpc.idmapd is to set up
the domain setting. Otherwise, the user root will be displayed as nobody with
UID=65534 or 4294967295 .
Use the following instructions to configure rpc.idmapd on your NFS client:
On your client, open the file /etc/idmapd.conf and change the domain
parameter to one of the following:
If your volume isn't enabled for LDAP, domain = defaultv4iddomain.com .
If your volume is enabled for LDAP, domain = <FDQN_of_Windows_Domain> .
Activate the changes to rpc.idmapd by running the following command:
nfs idmap - c
NFSv4.2 support
The Flex Unified, Standard, Premium, and Extreme service levels now support the
NFSv4.2 protocol in addition to NFSv4.1 on volumes that already have NFSv4.1
enabled.
When mounting an NFS volume, the Linux mount command automatically selects the
highest available NFS version. Mounting an NFSv4.1 enabled volume automatically
defaults to NFSv4.2 unless the vers=4.1 mount option is explicitly specified.
NetApp Volumes support NFS extended attributes xattrs with
NFSv4.2. The usage and limitations of xattrs , as detailed in
TR-4962 , are
also applicable.
Firewall rules for NFS volumes access
NFS uses multiple ports to communicate between the client and a server. For
communication between Google Compute Engine and NetApp Volumes,
these ports aren't blocked by default. If you use a firewall, you must enable
access to the following ports for the full NetApp Volume PSA CIDR
or the individual volume IP addresses:
111 TCP/UDP portmapper
635 TCP/UDP mountd
2049 TCP/UDP nfsd
4045 TCP/UDP nlockmgr (for NFSv3 only)
4046 TCP/UDP status (for NFSv3 only)
The IP addresses for NetApp Volumes are automatically assigned
from the CIDR range you assigned to the service during network peering. For
more information, see Configure private services access .
Advisory lock use with NFSv3
If you use advisory locks with NFSv3, you must run the rpc.statd daemon on
your client to support Network Lock Manager, which works with NFS to provide
System V style advisory file and record locking over the network. Your NFS
client must open an ingress port for rpc.statd to receive Network Lock Manager
callbacks. In most Linux distributions, rpc.statd starts when you mount the
first NFS share. It uses a random port that you can identify using the
rpcinfo -p command. To make rpc.statd compatible with firewalls, configure
it to use a static port.
To set static ports for rpc.statd , refer to the following resources:
Debian/Ubuntu
SuSE
RedHat
If you don't use NFSv3 advisory locks or Network Lock Manager, you can mount
your NFSv3 shares with the nolock mount option.
NFSv4.1 implements the lock function within the NFSv4.1 protocol, which runs
over the client-initiated TCP connection to the NFSv4.1 server on port 2049 .
The client doesn't need to open firewall ports for ingress traffic.
Connect Linux to LDAP
If you are using NFSv3 extended groups or NFSv4.1 with security identifiers,
you configured NetApp Volumes to use your Active Directory as
LDAP server using an Active Directory attached to a storage pool.
To maintain consistent user information between NFS client and server, you might
need to configure your client to use Active Directory as LDAP name service for
user and group information.
Use the following resources to configure LDAP:
RedHat deployment guide
Ubuntu deployment guide
SuSe deployment guide
When using Kerberized NFS, you might need to use the deployment guides mentioned
in this section to configure LDAP and ensure consistency between the client and
server.
