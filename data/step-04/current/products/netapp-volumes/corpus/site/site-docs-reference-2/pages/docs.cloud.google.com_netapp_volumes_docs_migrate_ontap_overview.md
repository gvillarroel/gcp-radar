This page provides an overview of the volume migration feature.
About volume migration
The volume migration feature lets you migrate volumes from ONTAP-based sources
to Google Cloud NetApp Volumes using a SnapMirror-based migration. SnapMirror works
on a per-volume level and can replicate a source volume to a destination volume
on a different system.
SnapMirror offers many advantages over conventional data copy methods:
It operates over any IP network and is resilient to network issues, supporting
a wide range of network speeds and latencies.
It copies only used data.
After an initial baseline data transfer, the subsequent transfers are
incremental, copying only changed data indefinitely. The calculation of
changes for incremental transfers is exceptionally fast and independent of the
data type stored in the volume.
The transfers retain storage efficiency. If the source volume contains
deduplicated or compressed data, these efficiencies are carried over, reducing
the amount of data to transfer.
All transfers are encrypted in transit.
You can use the source volume without any noticeable performance impact.
You can use the destination volume in a read-only state after the baseline
transfer is completed.
All data, including metadata such as complex access control lists (ACL) and
locked files is transferred.
SnapMirror transfers volumes between ONTAP systems, even across different
geographical locations.
Google Cloud NetApp Volumes uses SnapMirror for volume replication between NetApp Volumes in different
Google regions. Additionally, you can use SnapMirror to replicate between
external ONTAP-based volumes and NetApp Volumes, which is called
hybrid replication .
Hybrid replications include two types:
Volume migration is intended for one-time transfers from ONTAP to
NetApp Volumes.
External replication
is intended for ongoing disaster recovery replications where the replication
direction can be reversed.
Overview of migration process
Hybrid replication ensures fast, consistent, and complete data migrations from
source to destination with minimum impact on your production. This process
consists of the following phases:
Authentication
Baseline transfer
Incremental transfers
Cutover
Cleanup
Authentication
During the authentication phase, the storage administrators of the source ONTAP
system must grant NetApp Volumes permission to fetch a volume
from the source system. This is achieved through administrative steps on the
source ONTAP system, called cluster peering and SVM peering . The volume migration process
generates the ONTAP commands that administrators must run on the source system.
Baseline transfer
After you set up a migration, a snapshot creates a consistency point on the
source system. All data captured from this snapshot, including older snapshots,
is then transferred to NetApp Volumes during an initial phase
called a baseline transfer .
A baseline transfer can take minutes, hours, days, or weeks. This duration
depends on the following:
The amount of data in the snapshot.
The network speed between your ONTAP source system and NetApp Volumes.
The throughput setting of your NetApp Volumes.
During the baseline transfer, your source volume continues to serve your
workload and data is added, changed, or deleted. These changes don't affect the
snapshot used for the baseline's consistency point. While the baseline is in
progress, the destination volume isn't available to clients. After the baseline
completes, the destination volume becomes online and available for client access
in read-only mode. Note that the destination volume will have a different IP
address.
Unlike volume replication, volume migration can't read the source volume
parameters such as size, protocol choices, and export or snapshot policies.
Therefore, you must configure these settings correctly for the destination
volume.
You can now start mounting or mapping the destination volume to VMs to prepare
for the end of the migration.
Incremental transfers
After the baseline transfer completes, the migration triggers hourly incremental
transfers.
Each incremental transfer performs the following actions:
Takes a new snapshot of your source volume.
Calculates the data changes between the current and the previous snapshots.
Starts transferring these changes to the destination.
If a significant volume of changes occur since the baseline snapshot, and an
incremental transfer is still running when the next hourly transfer is
scheduled, this transfer is skipped. The next incremental transfer captures a
new source snapshot, deletes the oldest SnapMirror snapshot, calculates the
changes, and transfers them.
Clients that mount the destination volume see a read-only view with static
content. However, once an incremental transfer is complete, the volume's
contents are instantly updated from the previous replication snapshot to the
latest one through a single, atomic operation.
Unless the amount of new data added to the source volume exceeds what can be
transferred within an hour, the size of the incremental transfer decreases with
each successful transfer. This process continues until it stabilizes at a rate
defined by the source volume's hourly change rate, which might take a few
iterations. Once this steady state is reached, you can schedule a cutover. To
minimize the required downtime during the cutover, the objective is to reduce
the changes between the source and destination volumes.
Cutover
During a cutover, you move your workloads from the source volume to the
destination volume without data loss (RPO = 0) and minimal downtime (RTO). The
cutover process consists of the following substeps:
Stop modifications
Wait for current transfer
Perform a manual incremental transfer
Stop replication
Reconfigure and restart applications
Stop modifications
Since incremental transfers are asynchronous, your source volume might contain
changes that are not yet reflected on the destination volume. To synchronize,
stop all modifications on the source volume by:
Stopping all applications that modify data.
Optional: change the volume permissions to read-only to prevent any client
from modifying the data.
Wait for current transfer
Make sure that any running incremental transfers are completed.
Perform a manual incremental transfer
Perform a manual incremental transfer to send the latest data to the destination
system. This should take only a few seconds to minutes, depending on the volume
of data changed since the last transfer, network speed, and the throughput
limits of the destination volumes.
After the manual incremental transfer completes, the latest data is available at
the destination.
Stop replication
Run the stop operation on the replication to make your destination volume
read-writeable. This completes your data migration.
Reconfigure and restart applications
Reconfigure your applications to use the destination volume and then restart
them. Make sure that all data access to the source volume is stopped to
prevent any application from accidentally using the source volume.
Cleanup
If the cutover is successful, you can perform the following cleanup steps:
Delete stopped replication : when you delete the stopped replication, the
replication resource is deleted but the destination volume isn't deleted.
This process also deletes the SnapMirror relationship used in the backend
with your source system.
Remove cluster peering : if this was the last SnapMirror relationship
between NetApp Volumes and your source cluster, you can remove
the cluster peering from the source ONTAP system. Additionally, you can
remove any networking configured only for migration purposes between the
source and destination.
