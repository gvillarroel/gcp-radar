About auto-tiering
Auto-tiering reduces the overall storage costs of volume usage.
NetApp Volumes automatically moves infrequently used data to a
slower, cost-efficient storage tier.
You can enable auto-tiering at the per volume level. When auto-tiering is
enabled for a volume, NetApp Volumes identifies data that is
infrequently used and moves that cold data from the primary hot tier to a
cheaper but slower cold tier . Your active data stays on the hot tier.
As a user, you create a volume with the right size to hold all of your data.
Whether the data is located on the hot tier or cold tier, it is managed
automatically by the volume and is transparent to an application or user
accessing the volume using NFS or SMB. You can always see the full dataset.
NetApp Volumes determines whether to move cold data to the hot
tier based on the access pattern. Reading the cold data with sequential reads,
such as those associated with data copy, file-based backups, indexing, and
antivirus scans, leaves the data on the cold tier. Reading the cold data with
random reads moves the data back to the hot tier. This data stays in the hot
tier until it cools off again.
Note that regularly reading the data from the hot tier in non-sequential ways,
might block data from getting cold, which might affect antivirus full scans or
file-based full backups, depending on their data access pattern.
For Premium and Extreme pools, auto-tiering can be enabled during storage pool
creation or on existing pools. Once auto-tiering is enabled at the pool level,
you must explicitly enable it for each volume. After auto-tiering is enabled on
a pool or volume, it can't be disabled; but it can be paused and resumed on a
per-volume basis.
For Flex Unified and Flex File custom performance pools, auto-tiering can only
be enabled during storage pool creation. Once auto-tiering is enabled on a
storage pool, you have the option to create new volumes with or without
auto-tiering, though it is enabled by default. If you don't want auto-tiering
enabled during volume creation, you must explicitly disable it.
Once auto-tiering is enabled on a volume, it can only be paused, but not
disabled.
You can configure how long data remains hot before being considered cold
by using a volume-specific Cooling threshold parameter. The cooling threshold
can be set between 2 to 183 days. The default cooling threshold is 31 days. Data
that is cooled beyond the cooling threshold moves to the cold tier once a day.
Auto-tiering considerations
The following considerations apply while you use auto-tiering:
When you use volume replication, the auto-tiering capability is controlled
independently for the source and destination volume.
On storage pools with auto-tiering enabled, the cold block tracking will occur
on existing volumes that don't have auto-tiering enabled. If you enable
auto-tiering on these volumes, the old data immediately becomes eligible for
tiering and might get moved to the cold tier on the next day.
For iSCSI volumes, auto-tiering applies only to snapshot data. Used blocks
from the LUN won't be tiered, regardless of how often they are read. This
helps ensure consistent latency.
Performance and hot tier sizing
As a volume administrator, you must manage the auto-tiering parameters to
achieve your capacity, performance, and cost objectives. This sizing workflow
depends on the service level of the storage pool you want to auto-tier.
Premium or Extreme type volumes
The performance of an auto-tiered volume depends on the sizes of the hot and
cold tiers. Each GiB of hot tier size adds throughput capability of 64 KiBps
for the Premium service level or 128 KiBps for the Extreme service level to
the volume. While each GiB of cold tier size adds 2 KiBps of throughput
capability to the volume with increased access latency. If you need more
performance, just add additional capacity to the volume, as empty space in the
volume is counted as hot tier capacity.
The hot tier consistently stores all inode metadata required for file and folder
listing, as well as timestamp information.
Flex type volumes
Auto-tiering is available for Flex Unified and Flex File custom-performance
pools. You can enable it during storage pool creation or on existing pools. When
enabling auto-tiering on an existing pool, you must select a hot-tier size that
matches the current storage pool size. All volumes in the pool share the
performance capability set at the pool level.
When creating a storage pool as an administrator, you must specify the size of
the hot tier threshold as an additional parameter. The minimum size of the hot
tier is 1 TiB. You must ensure that the hot tier has sufficient capacity to
store your active data. If the hot tier is too small and data is written faster
than the rate at which it cools and moves to the cold tier, the hot tier might
become full. This can cause your applications to receive out-of-space write
errors. Therefore, proper sizing and continuous monitoring are essential.
You can monitor hot tier size manually or enable a hot tier auto-increase on
the pool. When enabled, the hot tier automatically increases size by 10% when
full, up to the storage pool's total size. Note that the size of a pool's hot
tier can't be decreased. Therefore, avoid applying workloads that migrate large
datasets of cold data into the pool. Otherwise, your hot tier will continue to
grow, reducing your auto-tiering cost savings.
Note: Modifying the pool capacity, IOPS, or throughput might fail for up to four
hours after an automatic increase in the hot tier threshold. If this occurs,
wait four hours and retry the operation.
To prevent the hot tier from filling up from large cold data writes into a
volume, especially during data migration, a hot tier bypass flag can be enabled
to direct writes straight to the cold tier, bypassing the hot tier. Once the
migration is finished, you can disable the flag and resume normal operation,
where writes go to the hot tier first. Active data that bypassed the hot tier
during migration is moved back to the hot tier upon the first random access.
The hot tier consistently stores all inode metadata required for file and folder
listing, as well as timestamp information.
Choose the right cooling threshold
The data block access frequency is monitored in 4 KiB intervals. Each day
without access to a block makes it colder, and its temperature is measured in
days. When a block's temperature reaches the cooling threshold value configured
on the volume, the block is eligible to be moved to the cold tier. Only eligible
blocks are moved to the cold tier daily. If the block is randomly accessed, the
temperature is set to 0 days and the cooling cycle starts again.
The cooling threshold is defined at the volume level and can be set between 2 to
183 days for the Flex, Premium, and Extreme volumes.
Data on the cold tier is priced lower than data on the hot tier. Using a shorter
cooling threshold moves data to the cold tier sooner, which can reduce the
overall costs. Although setting the lowest cooling threshold appears beneficial,
setting it too short might yield limited cost savings.
Data on the cold tier is slower to access than data on the hot tier. Using a
cooling threshold which is too short can make access to your data slower. The
overall volume performance depends on the hot tier capabilities.
Moving the data to and from the cold tier has data transfer costs. If you choose
a short cooling threshold, data can move more frequently between the hot and
cold tiers, which reduces the volume performance and increases the overall cost.
Using a cooling threshold that is too short can cause problems. The default
cooling threshold value is 31 days.
Auto-tiering pricing
Your billing is based on the allocated hot tier and utilized cold tier, each
charged at their respective rate. For more information about pricing, see
Storage pool pricing .
The storage pool billing is based on the total cold tier size of all volumes
within that pool. This total cold tier storage is then charged at the cold tier
pricing, which is significantly less than the hot tier pricing.
The hot tier pricing depends on the type of service level:
For the Premium and Extreme service levels: the hot tier size is calculated as
the total pool capacity minus the cold tier size and is charged at the
pool's hot tier pricing. If the pool's hot tier size is smaller than 2 TiB,
then a minimum of 2 TiB is charged at the hot tier rate, and the
remaining capacity is charged at the cold tier rate.
For the Flex service level: the allocated hot tier capacity is charged at the
pool's hot tier pricing.
Auto-tiering doesn't affect the throughput and IOPS capability of the Flex
Unified and Flex File custom-performance pools, but accessing cold data results
in higher latency and reduced throughput.
Additionally, there is a charge for network traffic associated with moving data
to or from the cold tier. For more information about pricing, see
Storage pool pricing .
Enable auto-tiering
For volumes in storage pools with auto-tiering enabled, an Auto-tiering tab
is displayed in the volume level details page. This indicates if tiering is
enabled or disabled for the volume. If you click this tab, you can look up
statistics, manage auto-tiering settings, and pause or unpause the tiering.
Look up tiering statistics
NetApp Volumes provides auto-tiering statistics at both the
volume and storage pool levels.
Volume level statistics
You can view the tiering statistics of a volume using Google Cloud console,
Google Cloud CLI, or Cloud Monitoring.
Use the following instructions to look up tiering statistics of a volume using
the Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI.
Console
Go to the NetApp Volumes page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to NetApp Volumes
Click the name of the volume.
If tiering is enabled on the volume, an Auto-tiering tab is displayed.
Select the tab.

gcloud
Look up tiering statistics of a volume:
gcloud netapp volumes describe VOLUME_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = LOCATION \
--format = "table(capacityGib,hotTierSizeUsedGib,coldTierSizeGib)"
Replace the following information:
VOLUME_NAME : the name of the volume.
PROJECT_ID : the name of the project the volume is
in.
LOCATION : the location of the volume.
For Flex service levels, the command shows the size of the hot tier and the
cold tier. For Premium and Extreme service levels, the hot tier size isn't
displayed. The size of the hot tier can be calculated by
capacityGib minus coldTierSizeGib .
For more information about additional optional flags, see
Google Cloud SDK documentation on volumes .
Cloud Monitoring
Cloud Monitoring receives auto-tiering statistics for Premium and Extreme
volumes, which can be visualized using metrics explorer or dashboards. The
available metrics include the following:
/volume/auto_tiering/tiered_bytes : specifies the number of bytes stored
in the hot tier and the cold tier. You can filter this metric using the
tier label to view data for the hot tier or the cold tier.
/volume/auto_tiering/cold_tier_read_byte_count : the number of bytes
read from the cold tier.
/volume/auto_tiering/cold_tier_write_byte_count : the number of bytes
written to the cold tier.
For more information, see
