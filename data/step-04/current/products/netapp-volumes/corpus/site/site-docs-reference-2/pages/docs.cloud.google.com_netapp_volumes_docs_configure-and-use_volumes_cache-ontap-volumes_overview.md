FlexCache overview

This page provides an overview of the FlexCache feature. The volume instructions
provided on this page don't apply to Flex Unified ONTAP-mode. You can't create,
view, update, or delete ONTAP-mode volumes using the Google Cloud console or
Google Cloud CLI. For more information about ONTAP-mode instructions, see
ONTAP-mode .
About FlexCache
NetApp FlexCache accelerates data access, reduces WAN latency, and lowers WAN
bandwidth costs for read-intensive workloads, especially when clients repeatedly
access the same data. When you create a FlexCache volume, it acts as a remote
cache of an existing (origin) volume. This cache stores only frequently accessed
hot data of the origin volume.
When a FlexCache volume receives a read request for hot data it contains, it
responds faster than the origin volume because the data has a shorter distance
to travel to the client. If a FlexCache volume receives a read request for
infrequently accessed cold data, it retrieves the required data from the origin
volume, stores it, and then serves the client request. Subsequent read requests
for that data are then served directly from the FlexCache volume. After the
first request, the data no longer needs to travel across the network, or be
served from a heavily loaded system.
While applications can write to a FlexCache volume, these writes are sent to the
origin volume to maintain cache coherence.
The integration of FlexCache with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes lets you provision
cache volumes within your Google network to improve performance for hybrid cloud
environments. This feature supports the transition of workloads to the hybrid
cloud by caching data from an on-premises data center to the cloud.
Volumes in NetApp Volumes can only serve as cache volumes, except
for Flex Unified ONTAP-mode volumes, which can also act as origin volumes. For
more information about setting up FlexCache in Flex Unified ONTAP-mode, see
ONTAP-mode .
FlexCache has the following characteristics:
Write behavior
Cache invalidation due to access time updates
Global file locking
CIFS change notifications
Cache prepopulation
Write behavior
FlexCache ensures that data you read from the origin or any of its caches is
always up to date. To manage writes in environments where data can be written to
the origin or any cache, FlexCache provides the following strategies to handle
these write operations.
Write-around
Write-back
Write-around
Write-around is the default cache setting. It is recommended for environments
with read-intensive workloads or where only small files are written.
When data is written to a FlexCache volume, the write operation is passed to the
origin volume. The cache acknowledges the write once the origin confirms it.
Writing to a file invalidates its cached copy, and the cache retrieves it again
upon the next access.
This strategy provides LAN-like read latency for cached data. However, write
throughput depends on the network connection to the origin. If the network
between the origin and a cache fails, users can still access data in the cache.
Write-back
Write-back is suitable only for specific workloads. It provides fast write speed
for heavy writes to large files. Write-back isn't recommended for workloads with
many small writes to multiple files, because the overhead of managing data
consistency between the origin and all caches reduces performance significantly.
Before enabling write-back for FlexCache, first review the ONTAP FlexCache
write-back guidelines , understand the architecture implications, and check if your
environment matches the documented workload profile . Write-around is the recommended option
unless you can verify that your workload is appropriate for write-back.
Users can optionally enable write-back support. When write-back is enabled,
clients can write large amounts of data to a cache with LAN-like performance.
The cache then sends these changes to the origin. Because a client's write speed
to the cache might exceed the rate at which data is sent to the origin, the
cache temporarily stores the changes until they are completely flushed to the
origin. During the period a client is writing to a file, the origin and all
other caches block read calls for that file until the write operation is
completed.
The write-back strategy provides LAN-like read and write performance to cached
data. However, if either the caches or the origin lose connectivity, all read
and write operations are blocked.
Cache invalidation due to access time updates
ONTAP provides a volume-level field called -atime-update to manage access time
updates on files and directories that are read using READ , READLINK , and
READDIR .
Access time updates on either origin or cache volumes can trigger file
invalidations that reduce cache effectiveness and cause slow performance and
high latency for file access. To prevent this, disable access time updates on
the origin volume using the ONTAP volume modify -atime-update command. In the scenarios where you need access
time to reflect recent reads, use the volume modify -atime-update-period command to define a period during
which access time updates are stopped. For example, setting it to 86400
seconds results in access time updates only once a day.
FlexCache volumes in NetApp Volumes inherit the -atime-update
setting from the origin, which can increase cache invalidations. Therefore, we
recommend that you disable access time updates on the origin volume.
Global file locking
Global file locking enforces deny-read and exclusive byte-range locks on files
across all caches and the origin volume. If these locks must be strictly
enforced in your workflow to maintain data consistency or prevent access
conflicts, enable global file locking.
Note: This feature is disabled by default.
Considerations
Enable global file locking only if you have reliable connectivity between the
cache and the origin. Unstable connections can delay or suspend modifications,
or result in timeouts if FlexCache volumes are offline.
Performance impact : enabling global file locking increases latency because
every cache read triggers a request to the origin for lock validation,
increasing the round-trip time (RTT).
Availability impact : if a cache volume goes offline, reads of its files
are blocked across all other cache volumes, and modifications to the origin
volume are suspended until all FlexCache volumes are back online.
As global file locking can affect system performance and reliability, keep it
disabled unless your workflow explicitly requires it.
CIFS change notifications
The SMB protocol provides a mechanism to notify SMB clients of changes made to a
volume by other clients. This allows applications, such as Windows File
Explorer, to update their views without polling the volume. This optional
feature is useful for caches where interactive users access files on SMB volumes
through Windows Explorer. Otherwise, it should be disabled to reduce
notification load.
Note: The feature is disabled by default.
Cache prepopulation
FlexCache accelerates read access by caching data upon first read from an origin
and helps ensure cache coherency, keeping the origin and all caches
synchronized. As a result, the initial file access has WAN-like read
performance, but subsequent reads are as fast as local reads.
If you know what specific data is required in your cache, you can use cache
prepopulation. Prepopulation lets you instruct the cache to fetch specific files
and folders before their first use, to accelerate reads on first access.
To start a prepopulation job, you must provide the cache with a list of
file or directory paths. You also have the option to enable recursion, which can
fetch all content within sub-directories.
A prepopulation job's execution time can vary depending on the amount of data to
prepopulate and the network speed between the cache and origin. FlexCache lets
you monitor the status of a prepopulation job whether it is still running or
completed.
