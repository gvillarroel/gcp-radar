This page provides an overview of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes and how it works.
About NetApp Volumes
NetApp Volumes is a fully managed, cloud-based data storage
service that provides advanced data management capabilities and highly scalable
performance.
NetApp Volumes helps to accelerate deployment times, manage your
workloads and applications, and migrate workloads to the cloud while keeping the
performance and features of on-premises storage.
NetApp Volumes lets you move file and block based applications to
Google Cloud. It has support for Network File System (NFSv3, NFSv4.1, and
NFSv4.2), Server Message Block (SMB), and Internet Small Computer Systems
Interface (iSCSI) protocols built-in, so you don't need to re-architect your
applications and can continue to get persistent storage for your applications.
NetApp Volumes offers multiple service levels which vary in
price, performance, features, and capabilities.
Key features
NetApp Volumes offers the following features .
For a comparison of features across service levels, see
service levels .
Fully-managed service : provides a fully-managed service with no
operations, integrated with the Google Cloud console .
Volume provisioning : provisions volumes from 1 GiB to 3 PiB in seconds.
Multiprotocol support : supports NFSv3, NFSv4.1, NFSv4.2, SMB 2.1, 3.0, and
3.1.1, and iSCSI protocols.
Automated snapshots : protects data with automated, efficient snapshots.
Auto-tiering : moves infrequently used data transparently to affordable
cold storage.
Backup : provides manual and automated backups for long-term retention.
Volume replication : enables business continuity with asynchronous volume
replication across Google Cloud.
FlexCache : allows fan-out caching of remote ONTAP volumes to accelerate
access.
High availability : provides high availability with options for
multi-region redundancy, backed by the NetApp Volumes service level agreement .
Rapid cloning : accelerates application development with rapid cloning.
Multiple service level offerings : offers multiple service levels based on
location, allowing you to pick a service level that best fits your needs. For
a comparison of features across service levels, see service levels .
Flex Unified (General Availability (GA) for iSCSI, Preview for NFS and SMB):
highly available, general purpose storage with advanced data management
capabilities.
Performance : independent provisioning of capacity and performance
with zonal pools in selected regions. You can provision throughput from
64 MiBps to a maximum of 5 GiBps in increments of 1 MiBps.
Each MiBps provisioned throughput includes 16 IOPS. Additional IOPS
beyond the included throughput of 16 IOPS can be provisioned as required
up to a maximum of 160,000 IOPS. Large capacity pools offer up to
22 GiBps of throughput and 750,000 IOPS.
Sample use cases : suitable for all workloads, with flexible
capacity and performance scaling, and zonal and regional availability.
The Flex Unified offers two operational modes :
Default-mode : designed for users who want a fully managed volume
experience. The Flex Unified Default-mode service level operates
completely within Google data centers, using only Google Cloud compute
and storage resources.
ONTAP-mode : designed for users who understand the management of
ONTAP-based storage systems and want to use ONTAP's extensive
capabilities. The Flex Unified ONTAP-mode service level operates
completely within Google data centers, using only Google Cloud compute
and storage resources.
Standard : highly available, general purpose storage with advanced data
management capabilities.
Performance : up to 16 KiBps per GiB of volume capacity.
Maximum of 1.6 GiBps per volume.
Sample use cases : common enterprise workloads such as Network File
System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) file shares, SAP shared
files, and Google Cloud VMware Engine.
Premium : highly available, high-performance storage with advanced data
management capabilities.
Performance : up to 64 KiBps per GiB exclusive to volume.
Maximum of 4.5 GiBps per volume. 30 GiBps with large capacity
volumes.
Sample use cases : performance-critical workloads requiring low
latency, for example, Windows and enterprise NFS, self-managed
databases and file shares, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and
VMware Engine.
Extreme : highly available, high-throughput storage with advanced
data management capabilities.
Performance : up to 128 KiBps per GiB exclusive to volume.
Maximum of 4.5 GiBps per volume. 30 GiBps with large capacity
volumes.
Sample use cases : performance-critical workloads requiring high
throughput and low latency, for example, Windows and enterprise NFS,
self-managed databases and file shares, VDI, and
VMware Engine.
Flex File : highly available, general purpose storage with advanced data
management capabilities. The Flex File service level operates completely
within Google data centers, using only Google Cloud compute and storage
resources.
Performance :
Regular pools : up to 16 KiBps per GiB of storage pool
capacity shared by all volumes in the pool in selected regions . Maximum of 1.6 GiBps per
pool.
Custom performance pools : independent provisioning of capacity
and performance with zonal pools in selected regions. You can
provision throughput from 64 MiBps to a maximum of 5 GiBps
in increments of 1 MiBps. Each MiBps provisioned throughput
includes 16 IOPS. Additional IOPS beyond the included throughput of
16 IOPS can be provisioned as required up to a maximum of 160,000
IOPS.
Sample use cases : common enterprise workloads such as Network
File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) file shares.
How it works
NetApp Volumes provides fully managed NFS and SMB remote file
systems, and iSCSI volumes as a service. Service administrators create and
manage these remote file systems as volumes and share them with NFS and SMB
clients over a network, or create iSCSI volumes and attach them to Linux and
Windows iSCSI clients. Clients such as Compute Engine VMs mount file system
volumes, their users, and the applications within the client store files in the
file system volumes. You can control access using Windows or UNIX-based
permission models.
The iSCSI Linux and Windows Compute Engine VMs can consume iSCSI volumes as
raw block devices, or they can choose to create the supported Linux or Windows
file systems and configure applications that support block storage.
Tools to use NetApp Volumes
You can use Google Cloud NetApp Volumes using the following tools:
Google Cloud SDK : the Google Cloud command line interface
lets you interact with NetApp Volumes through a terminal
Google Cloud console : the Google Cloud console provides a
visual interface that gives you a holistic view of your applications and
projects
Terraform Google Cloud Platform Provider : NetApp Volumes
resources are part of the Google Terraform provider .
For more information about how to provision NetApp Volumes
resources using Terraform, see introduction to Terraform integration .
NetApp Volumes architecture
NetApp Volumes uses the
Google Cloud Private Service Access framework ,
which creates a private connection linking your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
to the NetApp Volumes VPC. The Google Cloud private
service access framework assigns private addresses (RFC 1918) or non-private
addresses (non-RFC 1918) to it using the Service Networking API and
VPC peering constructs.
Network peering
To create volumes in storage pools, you must set up private service access. You
can set up private service access manually using Google Cloud console,
Google Cloud CLI, or Terraform. The storage pool creation workflow also
integrates private service access setup. All volumes in a pool are accessible
from Network-attached storage (NAS) clients on the same VPC, but
are subject to NAS access control. For Shared VPC, this enables data
access across different projects. You can't attach a single volume or pool to
multiple VPCs.
Independent of data access at the VPC level, all resources
belong only to the project they're created in and can only be managed within
that project Identity and Access Management (IAM) protects
management access.
Region availability
NetApp Volumes is available in several regions. For details about
region availability, see
NetApp Volumes locations .
