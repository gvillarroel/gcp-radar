Annotate assessments with transaction events
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to annotate assessments with transaction events to refine
your site-specific model.
For best performance, Transaction defense needs visibility
into payment lifecycle events for transactions. Therefore, we recommend that you
send annotations for the assessments that you created with transaction data. For
example, you can provide the transaction information to
Transaction defense as a transaction event in the
following scenarios:
The payment provider accepts or declines the transaction.
The merchant issues a refund.
The payment issuer files a refund.
To learn more about how to send annotations, see Annotate assessments .
We recommend that you make these requests automatically as part of the
corresponding logic in your system when the data is available, such as when the
status of a transaction changes.
After you create an assessment with included transaction data,
Transaction defense returns a verdict and an
assessment name .
Annotate the assessment with transaction events at the
following important stages in the payment lifecycle when they occur:
Event type
Description
Reason example
Value example
MERCHANT_APPROVE | MERCHANT_DENY
When you decide whether the transaction should be allowed to proceed.
IN_HOUSE
N/A
AUTHORIZATION | AUTHORIZATION_DECLINE
When you submit the transaction to be processed, and the card issuer
decides whether to allow the transaction to proceed.
82 (a reason code meaning that the CVV was incorrect)
N/A
CHARGEBACK
When the transaction is charged back.
Card Reported Stolen
20 (representing a partial chargeback of 20 units of currency)
Along with the CHARGEBACK event type, include the chargeback reason code that
was provided by the card issuer by using the reason field. Also, include the
monetary amount charged back in the value field if the transaction was
partially charged back.
In the transaction event reason field, either include clarifying terms to
provide more context on the reason for the event, or provide reason codes that
are obtained directly from the payment network or card issuer. These terms and
codes differ depending on the event type.
The following table specifies the complete list of transaction event types:
Annotation reason
Description
MERCHANT_APPROVE
Indicates that the transaction is approved by the merchant. The
accompanying reasons can include terms such as IN_HOUSE , ACCERTIFY ,
CYBERSOURCE , or MANUAL_REVIEW .
MERCHANT_DENY
Indicates that the transaction is denied and concluded due to risks
detected by the merchant. The accompanying reasons can include terms such
as IN_HOUSE , ACCERTIFY ,
CYBERSOURCE , or MANUAL_REVIEW .
MANUAL_REVIEW
Indicates that the transaction is being evaluated by a human, due to
suspicion or risk.
AUTHORIZATION
Indicates that the authorization attempt with the card issuer succeeded.
AUTHORIZATION_DECLINE
Indicates that the authorization attempt with the card issuer failed. The
accompanying reasons can include Visa's 54 indicating that the card is
expired or 82 indicating that the CVV is incorrect.
PAYMENT_CAPTURE
Indicates that the transaction is completed because the funds were
settled.
PAYMENT_CAPTURE_DECLINE
Indicates that the transaction couldn't be completed because the funds
were not settled.

Indicates that the transaction is canceled. Specify the reason for
the cancellation. For example, INSUFFICIENT_INVENTORY .

for the transaction, requesting additional information before a fraud
chargeback is officially issued and a formal chargeback notification is
sent.
CHARGEBACK_ALERT
Indicates that the merchant has received a chargeback alert due to fraud
for the transaction. The process of resolving the dispute without
involving the payment network is started.
FRAUD_NOTIFICATION
Indicates that a fraud notification is issued for the transaction, sent by
the payment instrument's issuing bank because the transaction appears to
be fraudulent. We recommend including TC40 or SAFE data in the reason
field for this event type. For partial chargebacks, we recommend that you
include an amount in the value field.
CHARGEBACK
Indicates that the merchant is informed by the payment network that the
transaction has entered the chargeback process due to fraud. Reason code
examples include Discover's 6005 and 6041 . For partial chargebacks, we
recommend that you include an amount in the value field.
CHARGEBACK_REPRESENTMENT
Indicates that the transaction has entered the chargeback process due to
fraud, and that the merchant has chosen to enter representment. Reason
examples include Discover's 6005 and 6041 . For partial chargebacks, we
recommend that you include an amount in the value field.
CHARGEBACK_REVERSE
Indicates that the transaction has had a fraud chargeback which was
illegitimate and was reversed as a result. For partial chargebacks, we
recommend that you include an amount in the value field.
REFUND_REQUEST
Indicates that the merchant has received a refund for a completed
transaction. For partial refunds, we recommend that you include an amount
in the value field. Reason example: FRAUD .
REFUND_DECLINE
Indicates that the merchant has received a refund request for this
transaction, but that they have declined it. For partial refunds, we
recommend that you include an amount in the value field. Reason example:
FRAUD .
REFUND
Indicates that the completed transaction was refunded by the merchant. For
partial refunds, we recommend that you include an amount in the value
field. Reason example: PROACTIVE_FRAUD .
REFUND_REVERSE
Indicates that the completed transaction was refunded by the merchant, and
that this refund was reversed. For partial refunds, we recommend that you
include an amount in the value field.
The following example shows a sample annotation payload containing a transaction
