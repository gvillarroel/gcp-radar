reCAPTCHA keys (also known as keys ) ,
let you protect your endpoints by verifying user interactions on your web pages
and mobile applications.
To choose the appropriate reCAPTCHA key type, you must understand the types of
keys that are supported for each platform and their differences.
Types of reCAPTCHA keys
The following table lists reCAPTCHA keys that are supported for each platform:

To verify user interactions on websites, reCAPTCHA provides
score-based keys , which don't trigger CAPTCHA challenges, checkbox keys, which
trigger non-deterministic CAPTCHA challenges, and policy-based challenge keys,
which trigger deterministic CAPTCHA challenges.
All the key types return a score
for each request, which is based on user interactions with your site. This score
lets you
understand the level of risk that the interaction poses and helps you to take
appropriate actions for your site.
The following table summarizes the differences between score-based keys, checkbox
keys, and policy-based challenge keys:
Comparison category
Score-based key (Recommended)
Checkbox key
Policy-based challenge key
Description
Score-based keys let you verify whether an interaction is
legitimate without any user interaction.
Checkbox keys use a checkbox challenge that requires user
interaction to verify that the user is not a robot. Also, you can use
checkbox keys to protect specific actions with CAPTCHA challenges.
We don't recommend using checkbox keys because they increase
user friction and don't significantly improve accuracy. For
more information, see the FAQs.
Policy-based challenge keys trigger CAPTCHA challenges based on the
configured score threshold. You can use policy-based challenge keys
to protect specific actions using CAPTCHA challenges.
How it works
With score-based keys, the reCAPTCHA Enterprise API
returns a score, which you can use to take action in the context of your
site.
Examples of actions you might take include
requiring additional factors of authentication,
sending a post to moderation, or throttling bots that might be scraping
content.
A checkbox key renders an I'm not a robot checkbox
that a user must click to verify that they're not a robot.
This checkbox key might or might not challenge them with CAPTCHA challenges.
In both cases, the reCAPTCHA Enterprise API returns a score.
CAPTCHA challenges require a user to select certain kinds of objects,
such as street signs, from a collection of images.
The following animated GIF is an example of a checkbox key:
The following image shows a sample CAPTCHA challenge:
Before using CAPTCHA challenges, you must understand the CAPTCHA challenges caveats.
With policy-based challenge keys, CAPTCHA challenges are triggered
if the initial score that is computed by reCAPTCHA is below
the configured score threshold. Policy-based challenge keys
differ from checkbox keys because they can deterministically trigger CAPTCHA
challenges.

Supported platforms
Websites and mobile platforms.
Websites only.
Websites only.
Use cases
Score-based keys are appropriate for the following use cases:
Websites that have accessibility requirements.
For payment-related transactions that prefer less friction for
better conversion rates.
Situations where you want to use additional features such as password
check (Password defense) or Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Sites accessed through mobile applications.
We recommend that you don't use reCAPTCHA for websites in
embedded WebViews, and instead use the built-in reCAPTCHA
iOS and Android SDKs.
Checkbox keys are appropriate for forms, logins, and signups on web
pages. Though it might cause extra friction for users, an extra step
such as CAPTCHA challenge helps to deter unsophisticated attackers.

Caveats with CAPTCHA challenges
If you want to use checkbox keys with CAPTCHA challenges to protect against
automated attacks, be aware of the following caveats:
CAPTCHAs require user interaction, which increases friction and might decrease
conversion rates.
Due to the advances in computer vision and machine intelligence, CAPTCHAs are
becoming less useful to distinguish between humans and bots.
CAPTCHAs are also under threat from paid attackers who can
solve all types of challenges.
CAPTCHAs are not accessible for all users, so they might not be suitable if
your website has accessibility requirements.
Choose reCAPTCHA key types for WAF
reCAPTCHA for Google Cloud Armor integrations support action-tokens, session-tokens and challenge page.
You can use one or more reCAPTCHA for Google Cloud Armor features in a single application.
For example, you can choose to apply a session-token for all pages, and based on the
session-token's score, you can redirect suspicious requests to the reCAPTCHA challenge page.
Also, you can use an action-token for high-profile actions, such
as checkout. For more information, see examples .
The following table shows a brief comparison of the available reCAPTCHA for Google Cloud Armor features:
Note: Only reCAPTCHA action-tokens are supported for the integration of mobile applications with Google Cloud Armor.
Comparison category
reCAPTCHA action-tokens
reCAPTCHA session-tokens
reCAPTCHA challenge page
Use case
Use to protect user actions, such as login or
comment posts .
Use to protect the whole user session on the site's domain.
Use when you suspect spam activity directed to your site and you
need to screen out bots.
This method interrupts a user's activity because the user has to verify
a CAPTCHA challenge.
Supported platforms
Websites and mobile applications
Websites
Websites
Client integration effort
Medium
Manual client-side integration.
Medium
Install reCAPTCHA JavaScript manually or through injection on the WAF.
Low
Interstitial triggered by security policies.
Detection accuracy
Highest
Client, server, and action specific signals are available.
High
Client and server speicific signals are available.
Medium
Client and server speicific signals are available. Client signals are only available in an interstitial page.
Supported reCAPTCHA version
reCAPTCHA score-based and checkbox keys
reCAPTCHA score-based keys
reCAPTCHA challenge-based keys embedded in an interstitial page
Choose reCAPTCHA express keys for APIs
Use reCAPTCHA express when your environment does not support a
reCAPTCHA client integration like the JavaScript API or the mobile
SDKs. reCAPTCHA express is suitable for APIs, websites, mobile applications,
and IoT devices such as TVs and gaming consoles, but can also be used to
protect websites or mobile applications when a client-side integration is infeasible.
Because reCAPTCHA express is a server-side only integration, it lacks client-side signal collection.
This typically results in a lower detection accuracy than integrations that involve a client-side component.
