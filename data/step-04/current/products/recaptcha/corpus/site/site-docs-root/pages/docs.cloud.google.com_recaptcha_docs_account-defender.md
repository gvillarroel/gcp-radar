Detect and prevent account-related fraudulent activities on websites
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document shows you how to use reCAPTCHA Account defense
to detect and prevent account-related fraudulent activities on websites.
reCAPTCHA helps you protect critical actions, such as login
and checkout. However, there are many subtle forms of account abuse that can be
detected by observing a specific user's behavior on a website over a period of
time. reCAPTCHA Account defense helps in identifying these kinds
of subtle abuse by creating a site-specific model for your website to detect a
trend of suspicious behavior or a change in activity. By using the site-specific
model, reCAPTCHA Account defense helps you detect the following:
Suspicious activities
Accounts with similar behaviors
Requests coming from devices that were marked as trusted for specific users
Based on the analysis of reCAPTCHA Account defense and the
site-specific model, you can take the following actions:
Restrict or disable fraudulent accounts.
Prevent account takeover attempts.
Mitigate the successful account takeovers.
Grant access only to the requests coming from legitimate user accounts.
Reduce friction for users logging in from one of their trusted devices.
Before you begin
Prepare your environment for reCAPTCHA .
Create a score-based site key .
Configure your web pages for reCAPTCHA Account defense
reCAPTCHA Account defense requires a comprehensive understanding of
account activities to enable effective detection. To start feeding
account-related activities to reCAPTCHA Account defense, and to
create and improve your site-specific model, do the following:
Enable collection of horizontal telemetry data .
Report on critical user actions .
Assess critical user events .
Annotate user events to tune your site-specific model .
Enable collection of horizontal telemetry data
reCAPTCHA Account defense requires a complete view of user
actions, such as whether the user is logged in or is about to log in. To enable
passive collection of horizontal telemetry data by reCAPTCHA
Account defense, load the reCAPTCHA JavaScript script with the
score-based site key that you created in the background of all the web pages
that are part of your user workflow.
The following example shows how to load the reCAPTCHA JavaScript script in a web page.
<head>
<script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/enterprise.js?render= KEY_ID "></script>
....
</head>
Report on critical user actions
To detect suspicious activity patterns and build a better model of
typical activity patterns on your site, reCAPTCHA account
defense needs the information about critical user actions.
Therefore, report
critical user actions on the web pages by calling grecaptcha.enterprise.execute() on those critical user actions.
We recommend reporting all the critical user actions because it helps in
additional signal collection. For every user action that you want to report,
replace the value of the action parameter of grecaptcha.enterprise.execute()
with an action name that describes the user action.
The following table lists the action names that you can use when reporting the critical user actions.
Note: Action names need not be confined to the following list.
You can add action names that are meaningful and describe the user action.
Action name
User initiated event or user action
LOGIN
Login to the website.
REGISTRATION
Registration on the website.
SECURITY_QUESTION_CHANGE
Request to change the security question.
PASSWORD_RESET
Request to reset the password.
PHONE_NUMBER_UPDATE
Request to update the phone number.
EMAIL_UPDATE
Request to update the email address.
ACCOUNT_UPDATE
Request to update account related information, such as contact details.
TRIGGER_MFA
An action that triggers an MFA challenge.
REDEEM_CODE
Request to redeem code.
LIST_PAYMENT_METHODS
Fetch the list of payment methods.
The following example shows how to call grecaptcha.enterprise.execute() on a
phone number update:
< script >
function onClick ( e ) {
e . preventDefault ();
grecaptcha . enterprise . ready ( async () => {
const token = await grecaptcha . enterprise . execute ( ' KEY_ID ' , { action : 'PHONE_NUMBER_UPDATE' });
});
}
< / script >
Assess critical user events
When you call grecaptcha.enterprise.execute() on a user action, it generates a token. For the critical
user events, such as successful and failed logins, registrations, and actions of the logged-in
users, create an assessment to assess the results of the grecaptcha.enterprise.execute() call. The
assessment provides you a risk verdict, which you can use to make a decision about how to handle
potentially fraudulent activities. Some of the actions you can take are blocking suspicious
requests, challenging risky logins, and investigating accounts of interest.
reCAPTCHA Account defense requires you to provide a stable account identifier to
make the assessment and to attribute user activity–such as login requests, logged-in requests, and
signup requests–to a specific account. This helps reCAPTCHA Account defense
process user activity patterns to build an activity model for each account to better detect
anomalous and abusive traffic.
Choose a stable account identifier accountId that is not often changed by the user
and provide it to the assessment in the
projects.assessments.create method. This stable account identifier should have the
same value for all the events related to the same user. You can provide the following as the account
identifier:
User identifiers
If every account can be uniquely associated with a stable username, email address, or phone
number, you can use it as the accountId . When you provide such cross-site
identifiers (identifiers that can be reused across sites), reCAPTCHA uses this
information to improve protection for your user accounts based on cross-site models by
flagging abusive account identifiers and using knowledge of cross-site abuse patterns related
to these identifiers.
Alternatively, if you have an internal user ID uniquely associated with each account, you can
provide it as the accountId .
Hashed or encrypted
If you do not have an internal user ID uniquely associated with each account, you can turn
any stable identifier into an opaque, site-specific account identifier. This identifier is
still needed for reCAPTCHA account defender to understand user activity
patterns and detect anomalous behaviour, but it is not shared across other sites.
Pick any stable account identifier and make it opaque before sending to reCAPTCHA by
using encryption or hashing:
encryption (recommended): encrypt the account identifier using a deterministic
encryption method that produces a stable ciphertext. For detailed instructions, see
encrypt data
deterministically . When you choose symmetric encryption over hashing, you don't need to
keep a mapping between your user identifiers and the corresponding opaque user identifiers.
Decrypt the opaque identifiers that are returned by reCAPTCHA to turn them into the
user identifier.
hashing: we recommend hashing the account identifier using the SHA256-HMAC method with
a custom salt of your choice. Because hashes are one-way only, you need to keep a mapping
between the generated hashes and your user identifiers so that you can map the hashed
account identifier that are returned back to the original accounts.
In addition to providing a stable account identifier for all the account-related requests, you
can provide additional account identifiers, potentially non-stable, for some specific requests.
Context-specific account identifiers provided in addition to the accountId help
reCAPTCHA Account defense better analyze user activity and detect account
takeover attempts to keep your user accounts safe. When you provide additional identifiers,
reCAPTCHA uses this information to improve protection for your user accounts based on
cross-site models by flagging abusive account identifiers and using knowledge of cross-site abuse
patterns related to these identifiers. For example, you can provide the following:
The username, email address, or phone number that was used as a login handle for login
requests
The email address or phone number that was verified for a multi-factor
authentication request
An email address or phone number (primary or secondary) that was provided by the user
during an account update request
The email addresses and phone numbers that are provided by the user during a registration
request
Append the chosen stable account identifier to the accountId parameter in the
projects.assessments.create method for all the account-related requests. Optionally,
provide additional account identifiers for the relevant requests by using the userIds
field in the assessment.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID
TOKEN : token returned from the grecaptcha.enterprise.execute() call
KEY_ID : reCAPTCHA key associated with the site
ACCOUNT_ID : the identifier that is uniquely associated with the user account for a
user account to your website
EMAIL_ADDRESS : Optional. An email address that is associated with this request, if
any
PHONE_NUMBER : Optional. A phone number that is associated with this request, if
any
USERNAME : Optional. A username that is associated with this request, if any
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://recaptchaenterprise.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /assessments
Request JSON body:

To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://recaptchaenterprise.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /assessments"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://recaptchaenterprise.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /assessments" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"tokenProperties": {
"valid": true,
"hostname": "www.google.com",
"action": "login",
"createTime": "2019-03-28T12:24:17.894Z"
},

}
},
"name": "projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/assessments/b6ac310000000000",
"accountDefenderAssessment": {
"labels": ["SUSPICIOUS_LOGIN_ACTIVITY"]
}
}
Note: If you are already using the legacy hashedAccountId parameter to provide
a stable account identifier to the
projects.assessments.create method, you can keep doing so. However, new
integrations should use the accountId parameter instead, because the
hashedAccountId is deprecated.

Interpret the risk verdict of the critical user events
When you create an assessment with Account defense enabled, Account defense
returns accountDefenderAssessment as part of the assessment response.
The value of accountDefenderAssessment helps
you assess whether the user activity is legitimate or fraudulent. It also returns
an assessment ID that you need to use when annotating user events.
The following example is a sample JSON response:
{
"tokenProperties" : {
"valid" : true,
"hostname" : "www.google.com" ,
"action" : "login" ,
"createTime" : "2019-03-28T12:24:17.894Z"
} ,
"riskAnalysis" : {
"score" : 0 .6,
} ,
"event" : {
"token" : "TOKEN" ,
"siteKey" : "KEY_ID" ,
"expectedAction" : "USER_ACTION"
} ,
" name" : "projects/PROJECT_ID/assessments/b6ac310000000000X" ,
"accountDefenderAssessment" : {
labels: [ "SUSPICIOUS_LOGIN_ACTIVITY" ]
}
}
The accountDefenderAssessment field can have any of the following values:
Value
Description
SUSPICIOUS_LOGIN_ACTIVITY
Indicates that the request represents a high risk
of credential stuffing or account takeover.
SUSPICIOUS_ACCOUNT_CREATION
Indicates that the request represents a high
risk of abusive account creation.
PROFILE_MATCH
Indicates that the attributes of the user match the
attributes that have been seen earlier for this particular user. This value
is an indicator that this user is on a trusted device that was used before to
access your website.
PROFILE_MATCH is returned only in the following scenarios:
You use Multi-factor (MFA) or Two-factor authentication (2FA)
and reCAPTCHA Account defense marks user profiles as trusted after
users pass the MFA or 2FA challenge.
You annotate assessments as LEGITIMATE or PASSED_TWO_FACTOR and
reCAPTCHA Account defense marks the corresponding user
profile as trusted.
RELATED_ACCOUNTS_NUMBER_HIGH
Indicates that the request has a high number of related accounts.
It does not necessarily imply that the account is bad but might require
further investigation.
Note: If the accountDefenderAssessment field is empty, it indicates that
reCAPTCHA Account defense did not have anything to add to the
score.
Annotate events to tune your site-specific model
To provide more information to reCAPTCHA Account defense and
improve your site-specific detection model, you must annotate the events that
you assessed by creating assessments.
You annotate an assessment by sending a request to the projects.assessments.annotate
method with the assessment ID. In the body of that request, you include labels
providing additional information about an event described in the assessment.
To annotate an assessment, do the following:
Determine the information and labels to add in the request JSON body
depending on your use case.
The following table lists the labels and values that you can use to annotate
events:
Label
Description
Request example
reasons
Required. A label to support your
assessments.
Provide real-time event details in the
reasons label in a few seconds or minutes after the event
because they influence real-time detection.
For the list of
possible values,
see reasons values .
Example: To detect account takeovers, annotate if the entered
password was correct with CORRECT_PASSWORD or
INCORRECT_PASSWORD values. If you deployed your own MFA,
you can add the following values: INITIATED_TWO_FACTOR , and
PASSED_TWO_FACTOR or FAILED_TWO_FACTOR .
{
"reasons": ["INCORRECT_PASSWORD"]
}
annotation
Optional. A label to indicate the
legitimacy of assessments.
Provide facts about login and
registration events to validate or correct your risk assessments in the
annotation label.
Possible values: LEGITIMATE
or FRAUDULENT .
You can send this information at any time or as part of a batch job.
However, we recommend sending this information in a few seconds or minutes
after the event because they influence real-time detection.
{
"annotation": "LEGITIMATE"
}
accountId
Optional. A label to associate an account ID with an event.
If you created an assessment without an account ID, use this label to provide the account
ID of an event whenever it is available.
{
"accountId": " ACCOUNT_ID "
}
Create an annotate request with the appropriate labels.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
ASSESSMENT_ID : Value of the name field returned from the projects.assessments.create call.
ANNOTATION : Optional. A label to indicate whether the assessment is legitimate or fraudulent.
REASONS : Optional. Reasons that support your annotation. For the list of possible values,
see reasons values .
ACCOUNT_ID : Optional. the identifier that is uniquely associated with the user account on your website.
For more information, see
labels for annotations.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://recaptchaenterprise.googleapis.com/v1/ ASSESSMENT_ID :annotate
Request JSON body:
{
"annotation": ANNOTATION ,
"reasons": REASONS ,
"accountId": ACCOUNT_ID
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running

Use and interpret the account takeover risk score
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
The Account Takeover (ATO) risk score feature adds a numerical
risk score and human-readable explanations to the Account defense
assessment. These insights help you understand the assessment and inform your subsequent actions
or decisions.
Note: You must have an Enterprise subscription to use the ATO risk score feature.
For more information, see Compare features between reCAPTCHA tiers .
Get the risk score
To receive the risk score and explainability reasons, send a CreateAssessment
request and include event.userInfo.accountId in your request.
Read the risk score and details
The risk score and explainability reasons are in the
accountDefenderAssessment.accountTakeoverVerdict object in the
assessment response.
Risk score :
accountDefenderAssessment.accountTakeoverVerdict.risk
Risk reasons :
accountDefenderAssessment.accountTakeoverVerdict.riskReasons
Trust reasons :
accountDefenderAssessment.accountTakeoverVerdict.trustReasons
The following snippet shows an example of the fields in an
assessment response:
"accountDefenderAssessment" : {
"labels" : [ "PROFILE_MATCH" ],
"accountTakeoverVerdict" : {
"risk" : 0.249 ,
"riskReasons" : [{ "reason" : "CLIENT_ACCESSED_MANY_ACCOUNTS" }],
"trustReasons" : [{ "reason" : "PROFILE_MATCH" }, { "reason" : "ACCOUNT_HISTORY_REPUTABLE" }]
}
}
Interpret the ATO risk score
When you use the risk score,
establish a threshold to determine when to take protective actions.
Use the ATO risk score as an alternative to the SUSPICIOUS_LOGIN_ACTIVITY label.
Do not use both the risk score and the label to trigger enforcement on the same assessment. You
can configure your enforcement logic either based on the risk score exceeding your threshold or
based on the label's presence. Generally, the risk score offers a more granular assessment.
We recommend that you evaluate the risk score's performance with an appropriate threshold on your
platform's traffic before you use it for enforcement.
To act on the risk score, implement a check in your backend as shown in the following snippet:
if (assessment.accountDefenderAssessment.accountTakeoverVerdict.risk > YOUR_CHOSEN_THRESHOLD) {
// Treat as suspicious
// Implement protective actions
}
Standard risk score thresholds
The following table provides standard risk score thresholds and their
expected False Positive Rates (FPR). Choose a threshold based on your
acceptable FPR. Performance can vary, so you might need to adjust your
threshold based on observed performance.
Expected FPR
Risk Score Threshold
0.1%
1.0
0.25%
0.9
0.5%
0.8
1%
0.7
2%
0.6
4%
0.5
8%
0.4
15%
0.3
30%
0.2
60%
0.1
100%
0.0
Adjust your threshold
If the observed FPR is too high, increase the threshold. If the observed
recall is too low and you can tolerate a higher FPR, decrease the
threshold.
Calculate intermediate values
To estimate the FPR for a threshold between the standard values, use linear
interpolation. The following example shows how to calculate the FPR for a
threshold of 0.85:
FPR ( T : 0.85) = ( FPR ( T : 0.8) + FPR ( T : 0.9)) / 2 = (0.5% + 0.25%) / 2 = 0.375%
To find a threshold for a specific FPR , interpolate between the
standard values. The following example shows how to find the threshold for an FPR of 5%:
Threshold = 0.4 + (0.5 − 0.4) × (8% − 5%) / (8% − 4%)
Threshold = 0.4 + 0.1 × (3 / 4)
Threshold = 0.4 + 0.075 = 0.475
A threshold of 0.475 is estimated to yield a 5% FPR .
Interpret explainability reasons
Explainability reasons provide insights into factors that influence the
risk score. Use these reasons to refine your decision-making.
Risk reasons : indicate factors associated with a higher risk of
account takeover.
Trust reasons : indicate factors that suggest legitimacy.
Both risk and trust reasons can appear for any given risk score.
Reason
Type
Interpretation
PROFILE_MATCH
Trust
The request matches a trusted profile associated with this
account. This is equivalent to the AccountDefenderLabel.PROFILE_MATCH label.
ACCOUNT_HISTORY_REPUTABLE
Trust
The account's historical activity is reputable. It is unlikely that
the account has been compromised in the past.
CLIENT_HISTORICAL_BOT_ACTIVITY
Risk
The client has been observed sending bot-like traffic to this site
in the past. This reason incorporates historical reputation and indicates
that the client is known to use bots, even if the current request is being
made by a human.
ACCOUNT_IN_LARGE_RELATED_GROUP
Risk
The account is part of a large group of related accounts,
indicating that it may be part of a fraudulent network. Related accounts
are identified based on having similar traffic patterns and request
characteristics.
CLIENT_ACCESSED_MANY_ACCOUNTS
Risk
The client has been observed accessing many accounts on this site.
