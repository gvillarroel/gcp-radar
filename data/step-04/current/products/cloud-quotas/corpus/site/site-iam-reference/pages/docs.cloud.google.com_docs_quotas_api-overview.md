Cloud Quotas API overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Cloud Quotas API lets you programmatically adjust project-level
quotas
and automate project-level quota adjustment requests . For
example, you can use the Cloud Quotas API to:
Automate quota adjustments : You can use the Cloud Quotas API to request quota
adjustments based on your own criteria. For example, to avoid quota
exceeded errors, you can use the API to programmatically request a quota
adjustment when Compute Engine resources reach 80% of the available quota.
Reuse quota configurations across projects : The Cloud Quotas API can clone
your quota configurations from project to project. If there is a known set of
quotas that need to be increased for every new Google Cloud project, you can
use the Cloud Quotas API to automate this in the creation logic of your project.
Quota adjustment requests are subject to Google Cloud approval.
Serve customer quota requests : If you are a SaaS provider integrated with
Google Cloud, you might receive quota increase requests through a
customer-facing portal other than the Google Cloud console. These requests must be
forwarded to Google Cloud for processing. The Cloud Quotas API can automatically
forward customer requests.
Enable client configuration version control : The Cloud Quotas API is
declarative. You can treat quota configurations as code and store
configurations in your own version controlled system for history and rollback.
Limitations
Cloud Quotas has the following limitations:
In most cases, quota increase adjustments must be made at the
project-level .
A limited number of products support
organization-level
quota increase adjustments. To see if a Google Cloud product supports
organization-level quota increase adjustments, refer to the documentation
for that product.
You can request quota decrease adjustments for
project-, organization-, and
folder-level
quotas.
Service endpoint
The service endpoint is a base URL that specifies the network address of an API
service. One service might have multiple endpoints. The Cloud Quotas API
service has the following endpoint and all URIs are relative to it:
https://cloudquotas.googleapis.com
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to access the cloudquotas_quotaPreferences , cloudquotas_quotaInfos , and cloudquotas_quotaAdjusterSettings resources,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Cloud Quotas Admin ( cloudquotas.admin )
IAM role on the project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
This predefined role contains
the permissions required to access the cloudquotas_quotaPreferences , cloudquotas_quotaInfos , and cloudquotas_quotaAdjusterSettings resources. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to access the cloudquotas_quotaPreferences , cloudquotas_quotaInfos , and cloudquotas_quotaAdjusterSettings resources:
cloudquotas.quotas.update
cloudquotas.quotas.get
monitoring.timeSeries.list
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
API resource model
The Cloud Quotas API resource model consists of two resources:
QuotaPreference and QuotaInfo .
Quota preference
The QuotaPreference resource represents your quota preference for a particular
dimension combination . Use
this resource to adjust the quotas in your projects, folders, or organizations.
Set a preferred value for a region
The following example shows a QuotaPreference resource in a
CreateQuotaPreference method.
{
"service" : "compute.googleapis.com" ,
"quotaId" : "GPUS-PER-GPU-FAMILY-per-project-region" ,
"quotaConfig" : {
"preferredValue" : 100
},
"dimensions" : {
"region" : "us-central1"
}
}
The preferredValue of 100 indicates that the
requester wants the GPUS-PER-GPU-FAMILY-per-project-region quota to be set to
that value. The dimensions field indicates the preference only applies to region
us-central1 .
Verify the granted value
View your quota preference and look at the grantedValue field to verify the
granted value.
To view your quota preference using the Google Cloud CLI, run the following in
your terminal:
gcloud alpha quotas preferences describe QUOTA_PREFERENCE_ID --project = PROJECT
Replace the following:
QUOTA_PREFERENCE_ID : the ID of your quota preference.
This is the value that was specified when the quota preference was created.
PROJECT : the ID or number of your Google Cloud
project.
If you made a quota adjustment request and the request is partially approved,
a stateDetail field appears after the grantedValue field. The
grantedValue shows the adjustment that was made, and the stateDetail field
describes the partially approved state.
To see if the granted value is the final value approved, look at the
reconciling field. If your request is still undergoing evaluation, the
reconciling field is set to true . If the reconciling field is set to
false or is omitted, the granted value is the final value approved.
The following code snippets show examples of the quota preference object. They
use a demo quota preference with the ID
compute_googleapis_com-gpus-us-central1 .
gcloud
If you view your quota preference using the gcloud CLI, the
output looks similar to the following:
createTime: '2023-01-15T01:30:15.01Z'
dimensions:
region: us-central1
name: projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/quotaPreferences/compute_googleapis_com-gpus-us-central1
quotaConfig:
grantedValue: '100'
preferredValue: '100'
traceId: 123acd-345df23
requestOrigin: ORIGIN_UNSPECIFIED
service: compute.googleapis.com
quotaId: GPUS-PER-GPU-FAMILY-per-project-region
updateTime: '2023-01-16T02:35:16.01Z'
REST
If you view your quota preference using the Cloud Quotas API, the
output looks similar to the following:
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/quotaPreferences/compute_googleapis_com-gpus-us-central1" ,
"service" : "compute.googleapis.com" ,
"quotaId" : "GPUS-PER-GPU-FAMILY-per-project-region" ,
"quotaConfig" : {
"preferredValue" : 100 ,
"grantedValue" : 100 ,
"traceId" : "123acd-345df23" ,
"requestOrigin" : "ORIGIN_UNSPECIFIED"
},
"dimensions" : {
"region" : "us-central1"
},
"createTime" : "2023-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" ,
"updateTime" : "2023-01-16T02:35:16.01Z"
}
This output includes the following values:
PROJECT_NUMBER : an automatically generated
unique identifier for your project.
The response shows a grantedValue of 100, meaning
the preferredValue from the previous example has been approved and fulfilled.
Preferences for different dimensions are different QuotaPreference
resources. For example, QuotaPreference for CPU in regions us-central1 and
us-east1 are two distinct resources.
Quota preference is required
QuotaPreference resources are used to indicate your preferred value for a
particular quota. The current value for a particular quota is based on:
QuotaPreference requests made by you.
Approved quota increase requests by Google Cloud.
Changes to quotas initiated by Google Cloud.
The ability to delete a QuotaPreference is not supported. However, you can set
a preferred quota value lower than the Google Cloud approved value to add further guardrails.
For more information on the QuotaPreference resource, see the Cloud Quotas API Reference .
For more information on the QuotaPreference queries, see
Implement common use cases .
Quota info
QuotaInfo is a read-only resource that provides information about a particular
quota for a given project, folder, or organization. It displays information from
the quotas defined by Google Cloud services and any fulfilled quota
adjustments initiated by customers. The QuotaInfo resource contains
information such as the metadata, container type, and dimensions.
Note: QuotaInfo resources are constructed by incorporating information from different
sources, a default quota configuration exists even in the case where a
QuotaPreference has not been set. Until the customer submits a chosen state through
a quotaPreference.create or quotaPreference.patch command, the QuotaInfo
resource relies on the default quota information available.
Set different quota values by region
The following QuotaInfo resource example shows that the CPU quota for the
project is 200 for region us-central1 and 100 for all other regions.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/services/compute.googleapis.com/quotaInfos/CPUS-per-project-region" ,
"quotaId" : "CPUS-per-project-region" ,
"metric" : "compute.googleapis.com/cpus" ,
"containerType" : "PROJECT" ,
"dimensions" : [
"region"
],
"isPrecise" : true ,
"quotaDisplayName" : "CPUs per project per region" ,
"metricDisplayName" : "CPUs" ,
"dimensionsInfo" : [
{
"dimensions" : {
"region" : "us-central1"
},
"details" : {
"quotaValue" : 200 ,
"resetValue" : 200
},
"applicableLocations" : [
"us-central1" ,
]
},
{
"details" : {
"quotaValue" : 100 ,
"resetValue" : 100
},
"applicableLocations" : [
"us-central2" ,
"us-west1" ,
"us-east1"
]
}
]
}
This output includes the following values:
PROJECT_NUMBER : an automatically generated
unique identifier for your project.
Set a global quota
The following QuotaInfo resource example shows a rate quota with a per minute
refresh interval. The dimensions are blank, which indicates that this is a
global quota. All quotas without a region or zone dimension are global.
{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/services/compute.googleapis.com/quotaInfos/ReadRequestsPerMinutePerProject" ,
"quotaId" : "ReadRequestsPerMinutePerProject" ,
"metric" : "compute.googleapis.com/read_requests" ,
"refreshInterval" : "minute" ,
"containerType" : "PROJECT" ,
"dimensions" : [],
"isPrecise" : false ,
"quotaDisplayName" : "Read Requests per Minute" ,
"metricDisplayName" : "Read Requests" ,
"dimensionsInfo" : [
{
"details" : {
"quotaValue" : 100 ,
"resetValue" : 200
},
"applicableLocations" : [
"global"
]
}
]
}
This output includes the following values:
PROJECT_NUMBER : an automatically generated
unique identifier for your project.
For more details on the QuotaInfo resource, see the Cloud Quotas API Reference .
For more details on the QuotaPreference queries, see
Implement common use cases .
Quota adjuster settings
The QuotaAdjusterSettings resource ( Preview )
represents your quota adjuster settings for a particular project. When enabled,
the quota adjuster monitors your usage of the specified resources and issues
quota adjustment requests when resource use approaches its quota value.
To view the current quota adjuster settings for a project, use a
GET
operation to retrieve the QuotaAdjusterSettings resource.
To enable quota adjuster for a project, use an
PATCH
operation to set the following QuotaAdjusterSettings resource options:
"quota_adjuster_settings" :{
"name" : "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/quotaAdjusterSettings" ,
"enablement" : ENABLED ,
}
Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with the unique identifier for
your project.
For details,
see Enable the quota adjuster
and Disable the quota adjuster .
Resource names
Resources are named entities and are identified by resource names. Resource
names are used in all requests and responses, and each resource must have
its own unique resource name. Each resource name is encoded by a set of fields.
Quota preference resource
The naming convention for a QuotaPreference resource uses the following pattern:
projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/quotaPreferences/ QUOTA_PREFERENCE_ID
You can set the quotaPreferenceId when creating a quota preference, otherwise
an ID is generated. It is recommended that a quotaPreferenceId naming scheme
encodes the service name, quota ID, location and other dimensions. The
quotaPreferenceId must be unique for the project, folder, or organization.
As an example quotaPreference
One pattern to encode your quota preference ID is the following:
SERVICE _ LOCATION _ DIMENSION1-VALUES-IN-ORDER
The following example demonstrates this pattern:
compute_us-central1_nvidia-200
The location field in a resource name is
always global . The Cloud Quotas API is a global service.
With a resource name, you should use the
GET
method to retrieve a QuotaPreference . You can also call the
PATCH
method with the allow_missing option enabled to create or update a
QuotaPreference .
Quota info resource
The naming convention for a QuotaInfo resource uses the following pattern:
projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/services/ SERVICE_NAME /quotaInfos/ QUOTA_ID
Quota adjuster settings resource
The naming convention for a QuotaAdjusterSettings resource uses the following pattern:
projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/quotaAdjusterSettings
