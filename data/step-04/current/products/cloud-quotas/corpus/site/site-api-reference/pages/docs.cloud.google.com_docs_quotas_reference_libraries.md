Cloud Quotas client libraries
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows how to get started with the Cloud Client Libraries for the
Cloud Quotas API. Client libraries make it easier to access
Google Cloud APIs from a supported language. Although you can use
Google Cloud APIs directly by making raw requests to the server, client
libraries provide simplifications that significantly reduce the amount of code
you need to write.
Read more about the Cloud Client Libraries
and the older Google API Client Libraries in
Client libraries explained .
Install the client library
C++
For information about this client library's requirements and install
dependencies, see Setting up a C++ development environment .
C#
Install the Google.Cloud.CloudQuotas.V1 package
from NuGet. Add it to your project in the normal way (for example by right-clicking
on the project in Visual Studio and choosing "Manage NuGet Packages...").
Ensure you enable pre-release packages (for example, in the Visual Studio NuGet
user interface, check the "Include prerelease" box). Some of the following samples
might only work with the latest pre-release version ( 1.0.0-beta01 ) of
Google.Cloud.CloudQuotas.V1 .
For more information, see Setting Up a C# Development Environment .
Go
go get cloud.google.com/go/cloudquotas
For more information, see Setting Up a Go Development Environment .
Java
If you are using Maven , add
the following to your pom.xml file. For more information about
BOMs, see The Google Cloud Platform Libraries BOM .
< dependencyManagement >

If you are using Gradle ,
add the following to your dependencies:
implementation ' com . google . cloud : google - cloud - cloudquotas : 0.56.0 '
If you are using sbt , add
the following to your dependencies:
libraryDependencies += "com.google.cloud" % "google-cloud-cloudquotas" % "0.56.0"
For more information, see Setting Up a Java Development Environment .
Node.js
npm install @google-cloud/cloudquotas
For more information, see Setting Up a Node.js Development Environment .
PHP
composer require google/cloud
For more information, see Using PHP on Google Cloud .
Python
pip install google-cloud-quotas
For more information, see Setting Up a Python Development Environment .
Ruby
gem install google-cloud-cloud_quotas
For more information, see Setting Up a Ruby Development Environment .
Set up authentication
To authenticate calls to Google Cloud APIs, client libraries support
Application Default Credentials (ADC) ;
the libraries look for credentials in a set of defined locations and use those credentials
to authenticate requests to the API. With ADC, you can make
credentials available to your application in a variety of environments, such as local
development or production, without needing to modify your application code.
For production environments, the way you set up ADC depends on the service
and context. For more information, see Set up Application Default Credentials .
For a local development environment, you can set up ADC with the credentials
that are associated with your Google Account:
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
After installation,
initialize the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
A sign-in screen appears. After you sign in, your credentials are stored in the
local credential file used by ADC .
Use the client library
The following example shows how to use the client library.
