Use Google Cloud NetApp Volumes file storage to configure a SQL Server failover cluster instance
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial describes how to configure a highly resilient Google Cloud
environment for SQL Server. You install this environment on Server Message Block
(SMB) fileshare storage by using Google Cloud NetApp Volumes.
Microsoft SQL Server Always On availability groups (AG) allow you to replicate databases across
multiple SQL Server Enterprise instances. Traditional SQL Server Always On
instances typically require each node to maintain a copy of the data, which can
quickly become costly as the databases grow. For example, in a traditional SQL
Server Always On deployment, if the databases are 10TB in size, each replica
must have at least 10TB of storage provisioned. One of the benefits of having a
Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) deployed for SQL Server is that you only
need to have one copy of the data, which is shared between the nodes of the
cluster. Therefore, running SQL Server Always On in a failover cluster instance
(FCI) on a WSFC can immediately realize cost savings by reducing the amount of
storage required.
NetApp Volumes is a cloud storage solution for running
high-performance SQL Server workloads in combination with Compute Engine
instances. SQL Server database over SMB on NetApp Volumes
provides a very high level of resiliency between the Google Cloud instances and
the storage service. SMB transparent failover enables maintenance operations on
the NetApp Volumes without interrupting connectivity to server
applications storing and accessing data on SMB volumes. To support SMB
transparent failover, NetApp Volumes supports the SMB continuous
availability (CA) shares option for use with SQL Server workloads. This option
provides performance improvements, scalability, and cost benefits for single
instances, Always On failover cluster (AOFC) instances, and Always On
availability group deployments.
Note: Filestream (memory optimized tables) is currently not supported on an SMB file share.
This page is intended for NetApp Volumes and SQL Server database
administrators who are responsible for deploying Microsoft SQL Server on
Google Cloud. It assumes the following:
You are familiar with the various components of the solution
You have already deployed Active Directory on Google Cloud
Objectives
This tutorial aims to achieve the following objectives:
Create a NetApp volume for SQL Server
Deploy Always On failover cluster over SMB on NetApp Volumes
Costs
This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud,
including:
Compute Engine
NetApp Volumes
Use the pricing calculator
to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.
Before you begin
For this tutorial, you need a Google Cloud project. You can create a
new one, or select a project you already created:
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
An Active Directory domain with at least one domain controller. You can
create an Active Directory domain by using Managed Microsoft AD .
Alternatively, you can deploy a custom Active Directory environment on Compute Engine and set up a private DNS forwarding zone that forwards DNS
queries to your domain controllers.
An Active Directory user that has permission to join computers to the domain
and can log in by using RDP. If you're using Managed Microsoft AD, you can
use the setupadmin user.
A Google Cloud project and VPC with connectivity to your Active Directory
domain controllers.
Make sure that NetApp Volumes API is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
Prepare your project and network
To prepare your Google Cloud project and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for the deployment of
SQL Server Always On availability groups, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, open
Cloud Shell
by clicking the Activate Cloud Shell
button.
Go to the Google Cloud console
Initialize the following variables:
VPC_NAME= VPC_NAME
SUBNET_NAME= SUBNET_NAME
Replace the following:
VPC_NAME : name of your VPC
SUBNET_NAME : name of your subnet
Set your default project ID :
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of your
Google Cloud project.
Set your default region:
gcloud config set compute/region REGION
Replace REGION with the ID of the region you want to
deploy in.
Set your default zone:
gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
Replace ZONE with the ID of the zone you want to
deploy in.
Create SMB on NetApp Volumes for SQL Server
To create a NetApp Volumes, you must create an Active Directory
policy, private services access, storage pool, and storage volume.
Create a new Private Service Access for NetApp Volumes
using the instructions provided in Configure private services access .
To create a new Active Directory policy , do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the NetApp Volumes page.
Go to NetApp Volumes
In the Navigation pane, click Active Directory policies under the
Policies section.
Click Create button.
Specify a name for the active directory policy.
Under Region , select the available region closest to where the SQL
Server instances will be hosted.
In the Active Directory connection details section, provide the
following information:
Name of the domain
Active Directory DNS server addresses
Active Directory site name
Name of the organizational unit
NetBIOS name prefix
In the Active Directory credentials section, provide the credentials
for a user who is allowed to join computers to the specified domain.
In the SMB settings section, provide the Backup Operators and
Security privilege users , if applicable.
Click Create to complete the process of creating a new Active
Directory policy.
To create a new storage pool, do the following:
In the Navigation pane, click Storage pools under the Storage
section.
Click Create button.
Enter a name for the storage pool.
Under Location , select the available region closest to where the SQL
Server instances will be hosted.
Select a Service Level that would satisfy the expected storage
performance.
Warning: SMB continuously available (CA) shares aren't supported on Flex
File service level. Use Flex Unified (Preview for SMB), Standard,
Premium, or Extreme service levels for Microsoft SQL Server. For more
information about comparison of features across service levels, see
service levels .
Enter the Capacity for the storage pool. Storage pool capacity
defines the total storage capacity that can be allocated for all the
volumes within the pool.
In the Network list, select the VPC that the SQL Server instances
will be hosted in.
In the Active Directory policy section, select
Assign an Active Directory policy to the storage pool and select the
Active Directory policy created in the previous step.
Click Create button to complete the process of creating a new storage
pool.
To test the connection between the storage pool and the active directory, do
the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Active Directory policy page.
Go to Active Directory policies
Click the Active Directory policy you assigned to the storage pool in the
previous step.
Locate Associated storage pools and click
Test Active Directory connection .
Note: If the connection fails, see Firewall rules for volumes access
to create any missing firewall rules.
To create a new storage volume , do the following:
In the Navigation pane, click Volumes under the Storage section.
Click Create button.
Specify a name for the storage volume.
Under Storage pool details , click Select storage pool to select
the storage pool created in the previous step.
In the Volume details section, provide the following information:
Share name
Volume capacity
In the Protocol(s) configuration section, select SMB protocol and
Enable CA share support for SQL Server, FSLogix .
Click Create button to complete the process of creating a new storage
volume.
Create firewall rules
To allow clients to connect to SQL Server, allow communication between the
Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) nodes, and to enable the load balancer to
perform health checks , you need to
create several firewall rules. To simplify the creation of these firewall rules,
you can use network tags :
The WSFC you use are annotated with the wsfc-node tag.
All servers, including the witness, are annotated with the wsfc tag.
To create firewall rules that use these network tags, use the following steps:
Return to your existing Cloud Shell session.
Create firewall rules for the WSFC nodes.
SUBNET_CIDR=$(gcloud compute networks subnets describe $SUBNET_NAME --format=value\('ipCidrRange'\))
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-all-between-wsfc-nodes \
--direction=INGRESS \
--action=allow \
--rules=tcp,udp,icmp \
--enable-logging \
--source-tags=wsfc \
--target-tags=wsfc \
--network=$VPC_NAME \
--priority 10000
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-sql-to-wsfc-nodes \
--direction=INGRESS \
--action=allow \
--rules=tcp:1433 \
--enable-logging \
--source-ranges=$SUBNET_CIDR \
--target-tags=wsfc-node \
--network=$VPC_NAME \
--priority 10000
Create a firewall rule that allows health checks from the
IP ranges of the Google Cloud probers :
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-health-check-to-wsfc-nodes \
--direction=INGRESS \
--action=allow \
--rules=tcp \
--source-ranges=130.211.0.0/22,35.191.0.0/16 \
--target-tags=wsfc-node \
--network=$VPC_NAME \
--priority 10000
Note: Depending on how you've deployed Active Directory, you might need to
create additional firewall rules to allow servers to join the domain. See
Accessing Managed Microsoft AD from within your VPC
for further details.
Create VM instances
You will now deploy three VM instances for the failover cluster.
Node-1 will host the primary replica of the SQL Server database
and node-2 will host the secondary replica. The two VM instances must:
be located in the same region so that they can be accessed by an
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
have WSFC and SQL Server 2022 installed using SQL Server premium image
Note: If you plan to bring your own licenses for SQL Server by using the
license mobility program,
select Windows Server base images for these nodes and install SQL Server
using your own product keys.
have Compute Engine WSFC support enabled
To provide a tie-breaking vote and achieve a quorum for the failover scenario,
you deploy a third VM instance node-3 that serves as a
file share witness .
Return to your existing Cloud Shell session.
Create a script
for the WSFC nodes. The script installs the necessary Windows feature and
creates firewall rules for WSFC and SQL Server:
cat < specialize-node.ps1
$ErrorActionPreference = "stop"
# Install required Windows features
Install-WindowsFeature Failover-Clustering -IncludeManagementTools
Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell
# Open firewall for WSFC
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow SQL Server health check" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=59997
# Open firewall for SQL Server
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow SQL Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=1433
# Open firewall for SQL Server replication
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow SQL Server replication" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5022
EOF
Create the VM instances. On the two VMs that serve as WSFC nodes,
attach an additional data disk and enable the Windows Server Failover
Clustering by setting the metadata key enable-wsfc to true :
REGION=$(gcloud config get-value compute/region)
PD_SIZE=200
MACHINE_TYPE=n2-standard-8
gcloud compute instances create node-1 \
--zone $REGION-a \
--machine-type $MACHINE_TYPE \
--subnet $SUBNET_NAME \
--image-family sql-ent-2022-win-2022 \
--image-project windows-sql-cloud \
--tags wsfc,wsfc-node \
--boot-disk-size 50 \
--boot-disk-type pd-ssd \
--boot-disk-device-name "node-1" \
--metadata enable-wsfc=true \
--metadata-from-file=sysprep-specialize-script-ps1=specialize-node.ps1
gcloud compute instances create node-2 \
--zone $REGION-b \
--machine-type $MACHINE_TYPE \
--subnet $SUBNET_NAME \
--image-family sql-ent-2022-win-2022 \
--image-project windows-sql-cloud \
--tags wsfc,wsfc-node \
--boot-disk-size 50 \
--boot-disk-type pd-ssd \
--boot-disk-device-name "node-2" \
--metadata enable-wsfc=true \
--metadata-from-file=sysprep-specialize-script-ps1=specialize-node.ps1
gcloud compute instances create "witness" \
--zone $REGION-c \
--machine-type n2-standard-2 \
--subnet $SUBNET_NAME \
--image-family=windows-2022 \
--image-project=windows-cloud \
--tags wsfc \
--boot-disk-size 50 \
--boot-disk-type pd-ssd \
--metadata sysprep-specialize-script-ps1="add-windowsfeature FS-FileServer"
Note: Depending on your performance requirements ,
consider using a machine type larger than n2-standard-8 for the WSFC
nodes.
To join the 3 VM instances to Active Directory, do the following for each of
the 3 VM instances:
Monitor the initialization process of the VM by viewing its serial port
output:
gcloud compute instances tail-serial-port-output NAME
Replace NAME with the name of the VM instance.
Wait for a few minutes until you see the output Instance setup finished ,
then press Ctrl+C. At this point, the VM instance is ready to be used.
Create a username and password
for the VM instance
Connect to the VM using Remote Desktop
and sign in using the username and password created in the previous step.
Right-click Start button (or press Win+X ) and click Windows PowerShell (Admin) .
Confirm the elevation prompt by clicking Yes .
Join the VM instance to your Active Directory domain and restart:
Add-Computer -Domain DOMAIN -Restart
Replace DOMAIN with the DNS name of your Active
Directory domain.
Wait for the VM instance to restart.
Assign storage permissions
To assign permissions to the cloud volume storage, complete the following steps:
From the Google Cloud console, select Cloud Volumes and select the volume that
was just created.
Connect to node-1 by using Remote Desktop .
Sign in with your domain user account.
Open Windows Explorer and right-click This PC .
Select Map network drive .
Paste the copied SMB path in the folder.
At sign-in, disable the Reconnect option.
Click Finish .
Right-click the mapped network drive and select Properties .
From the Security tab, click Edit .
Remove Everyone and add the SQL Server installer and SQL Server service
accounts with full control permissions.
Confirm the elevation prompt by clicking Yes .
Reserve cluster IP addresses
Reserve two static IP addresses in your VPC, one for the WSFC cluster IP address
and another for the internal load balancer.
Reserve a static IP for the internal load balancer and capture the address
in a new environment variable named LOADBALANCER_ADDRESS :
gcloud compute addresses create wsfc \
--region $(gcloud config get-value compute/zone | rev | cut -c 3- | rev) \
--subnet $SUBNET_NAME
LOADBALANCER_ADDRESS=$(gcloud compute addresses describe wsfc \
--region $(gcloud config get-value compute/zone | rev | cut -c 3- | rev) \
--format=value\(address\))
echo "Load Balancer IP: $LOADBALANCER_ADDRESS"
Note the IP address, you'll need it later.
Reserve another static IP address that you use as cluster IP:
gcloud compute addresses create wsfc-cluster \
--subnet $SUBNET_NAME \
--region $(gcloud config get-value compute/zone | rev | cut -c 3- | rev)
CLUSTER_ADDRESS=$(gcloud compute addresses describe wsfc-cluster \
--region $(gcloud config get-value compute/zone | rev | cut -c 3- | rev) \
--format=value\(address\))
echo "Cluster IP: $CLUSTER_ADDRESS"
Note the IP address, you'll need it later.
Your project and VPC are now ready for the deployment of the WSFC and SQL Server.
Create a witness file share
To prepare witness to serve as file share witness, create a file share and
grant yourself and the two WSFC nodes access to the file share:
Connect to witness by using Remote Desktop .
Sign in with your domain user account.
Right-click Start button (or press Win+X ) and click
Windows PowerShell (Admin) .
Confirm the elevation prompt by clicking Yes .
Create the witness folder and share the folder:
New-Item "C:\QWitness" –type directory
icacls C:\QWitness\ /grant 'node-1$:(OI)(CI)(M)'
icacls C:\QWitness\ /grant 'node-2$:(OI)(CI)(M)'
New-SmbShare `
-Name QWitness `
-Path "C:\QWitness" `
-Description "SQL File Share Witness" `
-FullAccess $env:username,node-1$,node-2$
Deploying the failover cluster
You will now use the VM instances to deploy a WSFC and SQL Server.
Deploy WSFC
You are now ready to create the failover cluster:
Connect to node-1 by using Remote Desktop .
Sign in with your domain user account.
Right-click Start button (or press Win+X ) and click
Windows PowerShell (Admin) .
Confirm the elevation prompt by clicking Yes .
Create a new cluster:
New-Cluster `
-Name windows-fci `
-Node node-1,node-2 `
-NoStorage `
-StaticAddress CLUSTER_ADDRESS
Replace CLUSTER_ADDRESS with the cluster IP address
that you created earlier.
Return to the PowerShell session on witness and grant the virtual
computer object of the cluster permission to access the file share:
icacls C:\QWitness\ /grant 'windows-fci$:(OI)(CI)(M)'
Grant-SmbShareAccess `
-Name QWitness `
-AccountName 'windows-fci$' `
-AccessRight Full `
-Force
Return to the PowerShell session on node-1 and configure the cluster
to use the file share on witness as a cluster quorum:
Set-ClusterQuorum -FileShareWitness \\witness\QWitness
Verify that the cluster was created successfully:
Test-Cluster
You might see some warnings that can be safely ignored:
WARNING: System Configuration - Validate All Drivers Signed: The test
reported some warnings..
WARNING: Network - Validate Network Communication: The test reported some
warnings..
WARNING:
Test Result:
HadUnselectedTests, ClusterConditionallyApproved
Testing has completed for the tests you selected. You should review the
warnings in the Report. A cluster solution is supported by Microsoft only
if you run all cluster validation tests, and all tests succeed (with or
without warnings).
You can also launch the Failover Cluster Manager MMC snap-in to review the
cluster's health by running cluadmin.msc .
If you're using Managed AD, add the computer account used by WSFC to the
Cloud Service Domain Join Accounts group so that it can join VM
instances to the domain:
Add-ADGroupMember `
-Identity "Cloud Service Domain Join Accounts" `
-Members windows-fci$
Remove the default SQL Server installation
You will now remove the default SQL Server installation from the two nodes and
replace it with a new FCI configuration.
For each of the two WSFC nodes, node-1 and node-2 , perform the following
steps:
Right-click Start button (or press Win+X ) and click
Windows PowerShell (Admin) .
Confirm the elevation prompt by clicking Yes .
Remove the default SQL Server instance:
C:\sql_server_install\Setup.exe /Action=Uninstall /FEATURES=SQL,AS,IS,RS /INSTANCENAME=MSSQLSERVER /Q
Remove Microsoft OLE Driver:
Get-Package -Name "Microsoft OLE*" | Uninstall-Package -Force
Remove Microsoft ODBC Driver:
Get-Package -Name "Microsoft ODBC*" | Uninstall-Package -Force
Restart the computer:
Restart-Computer
Wait for the VM instance to restart.
Install SQL Server FCI
Before you install the new FCI configuration, verify that the node-1 is the
active node in the cluster:
Reconnect to node-1 by using Remote Desktop
and sign in using your domain user.
Right-click Start button (or press Win+X ) and select Run
Enter cluadmin.msc and select OK .
In the left window pane, navigate to Failover Cluster Manager > windows-fci , and do the following:
Verify that the current host server is set to node-1 .
If the current host server is set to node-2 , right-click
windows-fci in the left window pane and select
More actions > Move core cluster resources > Select node… > node-1
and click OK .
You will create a new SQL Server failover cluster installation on node-1 :
Right-click Start button (or press Win+X ) and click
Windows PowerShell (Admin) .
Confirm the elevation prompt by clicking Yes .
Start the SQL Server setup:
& c:\sql_server_install\setup.exe
In the menu on the left, select Installation .

earlier for both SQL Server Agent and SQL Server Database Engine .
Then select Next .
On the Ready to Install page, review the settings, then select
Install .
After the installation completes, select Close .
Configure health checks
As a final step, configure the cluster to expose a health check endpoint that
can be used by an internal load balancer:
Return to the PowerShell session on node-2
Initialize a variable with the IP address of the load balancer.
$LoadBalancerIP = ' IP_ADDRESS '
Replace IP_ADDRESS with the IP address of the wsfc
address that you reserved earlier.
Configure the Failover Cluster to respond to the health check service:
$SqlGroup = Get-ClusterGroup |
Where-Object {$_.Name.StartsWith("SQL Server")}
$SqlIpAddress = Get-ClusterResource |
Where-Object {$_.Name.StartsWith("SQL IP Address")}
$SqlIpAddress | Set-ClusterParameter -Multiple @{
'Address'=$LoadBalancerIP;
'ProbePort'= 59997;
'SubnetMask'='255.255.255.255';
'Network'= (Get-ClusterNetwork).Name;
'EnableDhcp'=0; }
Restart the cluster resource:
$SqlIpAddress | Stop-ClusterResource
$SqlIpAddress | Start-ClusterResource
Restart the cluster group:
$SqlGroup | Stop-ClusterGroup
$SqlGroup | Start-ClusterGroup
Create an internal load balancer
To provide a single endpoint for SQL Server clients, you will now deploy an
internal load balancer .
The load balancer uses a health check which ensures that traffic is directed to
the active node of the WSFC.
Return to your existing Cloud Shell session.
Create an unmanaged instance group ,
and add the two nodes to the group:
REGION=$(gcloud config get-value compute/region)
gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged create wsfc-group-a \
--zone $REGION-a
gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged add-instances wsfc-group-a \
--zone $REGION-a --instances node-1
gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged create wsfc-group-b \
--zone $REGION-b
gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged add-instances wsfc-group-b \
--zone $REGION-b --instances node-2
Create a health check that the load balancer can use to determine which is
the active node.
gcloud compute health-checks create tcp wsfc-healthcheck \
--check-interval="2s" \
--healthy-threshold=1 \
--unhealthy-threshold=2 \
--port=59997 \
--timeout="1s"
The health check probes port 59997 , which is the port you previously
configured as ProbePort for the WSFC cluster IP address.
Create a backend service and add the instance group:
gcloud compute backend-services create wsfc-backend \
--load-balancing-scheme internal \
--region $REGION \
--health-checks wsfc-healthcheck \
--protocol tcp
gcloud compute backend-services add-backend wsfc-backend \
--instance-group wsfc-group-a \
--instance-group-zone $REGION-a \
--region $REGION
gcloud compute backend-services add-backend wsfc-backend \
--instance-group wsfc-group-b \
--instance-group-zone $REGION-b \
--region $REGION
Create the internal load balancer:
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create wsfc-sql \
--load-balancing-scheme internal \
--address $LOADBALANCER_ADDRESS \
--ports 1433 \
--network $VPC_NAME \
--subnet $SUBNET_NAME \
--region $REGION \
--backend-service wsfc-backend
Testing the failover cluster
You've completed the installation of the failover cluster, but you still have to
test whether the cluster works correctly.
Prepare a client
Create a new VM instance which you can use to connect to the failover cluster:
Return to your existing Cloud Shell session.
Create a new VM instance:
gcloud compute instances create sqlclient \
--machine-type n2-standard-2 \
--subnet $SUBNET_NAME \
--image-family sql-ent-2022-win-2022 \
--image-project windows-sql-cloud \
--boot-disk-size 50 \
--boot-disk-type pd-ssd
Monitor the initialization process of the VM by viewing its serial port
output:
gcloud compute instances tail-serial-port-output sqlclient
Wait for a few minutes until you see the output Instance setup finished,
then press Ctrl+C. At this point, the VM instance is ready to be used.
Create a username and password
for the VM instance
Connect to the VM by using Remote Desktop
and sign in using the username and password created in the previous step.
Right-click Start button (or press Win+X ) and click
Windows PowerShell (Admin) .
Confirm the elevation prompt by clicking Yes .
Join the VM instance to your Active Directory domain:
Add-Computer -Domain DOMAIN
Replace DOMAIN with the DNS name of your Active
Directory domain.
Restart the VM instance:
Restart-Computer
Wait for the VM instance to restart.
Run the test
Use the sqlclient VM to test that you can connect to the failover cluster and
to verify that the failover works correctly:
Connect to sqlclient by using Remote Desktop
and sign in using your domain user.
Right-click Start button (or press Win+X ) and click
Windows PowerShell .
Connect to SQL Server cluster by using its network name sql and query the
dm_os_cluster_nodes table:
& "$env:ProgramFiles\Microsoft SQL Server\Client SDK\ODBC\170\Tools\Binn\SQLCMD.EXE" `
-S sql -E -Q "SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_cluster_nodes"
The output should look like this:
NodeName status status_description is_current_owner
------------------------------ ----------- ------------------ ----------------
NODE-1 0 up 1
NODE-2 0 up 0
(2 rows affected)
Notice that node-1 is the current owner of the SQL Server failover cluster
resource.
Return to Cloud Shell and bring down the node-1 VM to test the failover
scenario:
gcloud compute instances stop node-1
Repeat the query:
& "$env:ProgramFiles\Microsoft SQL Server\Client SDK\ODBC\170\Tools\Binn\SQLCMD.EXE" `
-S sql -E -Q "SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_cluster_nodes"
The output should now look like this:
NodeName status status_description is_current_owner
------------------------------ ----------- ------------------ ----------------
NODE-1 1 down 0
NODE-2 0 up 1
(2 rows affected)
Notice that despite the loss of node-1 , the query succeeds, and shows that
node-2 is now the current owner of the failover cluster.
Clean up
After you finish the tutorial, you can clean up the resources that you created so that they
stop using quota and incurring charges. The following sections describe how to delete or turn off
these resources.
Deleting the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
