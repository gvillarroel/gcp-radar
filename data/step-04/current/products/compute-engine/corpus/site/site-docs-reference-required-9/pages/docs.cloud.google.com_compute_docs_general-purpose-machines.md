C4D machine series
C4D VMs are powered by the fifth generation AMD EPYC Turin processor and
Titanium .
C4D delivers a 30% performance boost over C3D on the estimated
SPECrate®2017_int_base benchmark , which lets
you scale performance with fewer resources, thereby optimizing your costs.
C4D is designed to run workloads including web, app and game servers, AI
inference, video streaming, and data centric applications like
analytics, as well as relational and in-memory databases.
For databases, C4D delivers 55% more queries per second for MySQL and 35% higher
operations per second for Memorystore for Redis workloads
compared to C3D due to its higher core frequency (up to 4.1 GHz) and
improved Instructions Per Clock (IPC).
Note: C4D doesn't support All Core Turbo Mode setting. C4D instances always run
without frequency restrictions.
For web-serving workloads, AMD EPYC Turin's advancements in L3-cache efficiency
and branch prediction enable up to 80% higher throughput per vCPU with C4D.
In summary, the C4D machine series has the following features:
Powered by the AMD EPYC Turin CPU and Titanium.
Supports up to 384 vCPUs and 3,024 GB of DDR5 memory.
Supports up to 12 TiB of local Titanium SSD disks.

Network support for C4D instances
The following network interface drivers are required:
C4D instances require
gVNIC network interfaces .
C4D bare metal instances require the
Intel IDPF LAN PF device driver .
C4D supports up to 100 Gbps network bandwidth for standard
networking and up to 200 Gbps with per VM Tier_1 networking performance for VM and
bare metal instances.
Before migrating to C4D or creating C4D VMs or bare metal
instances, make sure that the
operating system image
that you use supports the IDPF network driver for bare metal instances or the
gVNIC driver for VM instances. To get the best possible performance on
C4D VMs, choose an OS image that supports both
"Tier_1 Networking" and "200 Gbps network bandwidth". These images include an
updated gVNIC driver, even if the guest OS shows the gve driver version as
1.0.0. If your C4D VM is
using an operating system with an older version of gVNIC driver, this is still
supported but the VM might experience suboptimal performance such as less
network bandwidth or higher latency.
If you use a custom OS image to create a C4D VM, you can
manually install the most recent gVNIC driver .
The gVNIC driver version v1.4.2 or later is recommended for use with C4D
VMs. Google recommends using the latest gVNIC driver version to benefit from
additional features and bug fixes.
Maintenance experience for C4D instances
During the lifespan of a virtual machine (VM) instance,
the host machine that your instance runs undergoes multiple host events.
A host event can include the regular maintenance of Compute Engine
infrastructure, or in rare cases, a host error. Compute Engine also
applies some non-disruptive lightweight upgrades for the hypervisor and network
in the background.
The C4D machine series offers the following features related to host
maintenance:

Network support for C4A instances
C4A instances require
gVNIC network interfaces .
C4A instances support up to 50 Gbps network bandwidth for standard
networking and up to 100 Gbps network bandwidth per VM Tier_1 networking performance.
Before migrating to C4A or creating C4A VMs or bare metal
instances, make sure that the
operating system image
that you use supports the IDPF network driver for bare metal instances or the
gVNIC driver for VM instances. To get the best possible performance on
C4A VMs, choose an OS image that supports both
"Tier_1 Networking" and "100 Gbps network bandwidth". These images include an
updated gVNIC driver, even if the guest OS shows the gve driver version as
1.0.0. If your C4A VM is
using an operating system with an older version of gVNIC driver, this is still
supported but the VM might experience suboptimal performance such as less
network bandwidth or higher latency.
If you use a custom OS image to create a C4A VM, you can
manually install the most recent gVNIC driver .
The gVNIC driver version v1.4.2 or later is recommended for use with C4A
VMs. Google recommends using the latest gVNIC driver version to benefit from
additional features and bug fixes.
Maintenance experience for C4A instances
During the lifespan of a virtual machine (VM) instance,
the host machine that your instance runs undergoes multiple host events.
A host event can include the regular maintenance of Compute Engine
infrastructure, or in rare cases, a host error. Compute Engine also
applies some non-disruptive lightweight upgrades for the hypervisor and network
in the background.
The C4A machine series offers the following features related to host
maintenance:
Machine type
Typical scheduled maintenance event frequency
Maintenance behavior
Advanced notification
On-demand maintenance

more frequently.
C4 machine series
C4 VMs are powered by 6th generation (code-named Granite Rapids) or 5th
generation (code-named Emerald Rapids) Intel Xeon Scalable processors and
Titanium . C4 Local SSD ( -lssd ) and bare metal
( -metal ) instances, as well as
instances with 144 or 288 vCPUs, use the 6th generation Intel Granite Rapids
processor. All other instances use the 5th generation Intel Emerald Rapids
processor.
The C4 machine series is designed to deliver
price-performance and enterprise-grade reliability along with a maintenance
experience for your most demanding workloads. C4 instances are ideal for web and
app serving, game servers, databases and
caches, video streaming, data analytics, network appliances, and CPU-based
ML inference.
C4 VMs are designed to achieve maximum performance from single-core turbo
boosting. For more consistent vCPU performance, disable vCPU boosting and limit
the vCPUs to the sustainable all-core turbo frequency. You
can do this by setting turboMode=ALL_CORE_MAX in the
AdvancedMachineFeatures
settings.
In summary, the C4 machine series:
Is powered by the 6th generation Intel Granite Rapids or 5th generation Intel
Emerald Rapids processor and Titanium IPU.
Lets you switch between core-boosting performance and steady all-core turbo
performance for your vCPUs.
Supports up to 288 vCPUs and 2.2 TB of DDR5 memory.
Supports up to 18 TiB of local Titanium SSD disks.
Supports compact and spread placement policies.
Offers multiple predefined machine types.
Supports standard network configuration with up to 100 Gbps bandwidth.
Supports per VM Tier_1 networking performance with up to 200 Gbps bandwidth.
Supports Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) ,
a built-in accelerator that significantly improves the performance of
deep-learning training and inference on the CPU.
Supports the following discount and consumption options:
Resource-based and flexible committed use discounts (CUDs)
Spot VMs
Reservations
Supports the performance monitoring unit (PMU) .
C4 Limitations
You can't dynamically add or remove a disk when using Windows Server 25.
You can't dynamically add or remove multiple disks when using Windows Server
25 or Windows 11.
C4 VM shapes powered by Granite Rapids
might experience lower networking performance on Windows 11 and Debian 11
OS images .
C4 machine types
C4 VMs are available as predefined configurations in
sizes ranging from 2 vCPUs to 288
vCPUs and up to 2,232 GB
of memory.
standard : 3.75 GB memory per vCPU
highcpu : 2 GB memory per vCPU
highmem : 7.75 GB memory per vCPU
To use Titanium SSD with C4, create your instance using the -lssd variant of
the C4 machine types. Selecting this machine type creates an instance of the
specified size with Titanium SSD partitions attached. You can't attach
Titanium SSD volumes separately.
To create a bare metal instance with C4,
use one of the following machine types:

Network support for C4 VMs
The following network interface drivers are required:
C4 instances require
gVNIC network interfaces .
C4 bare metal instances require the
Intel IDPF LAN PF device driver .
C4 supports up to 100 Gbps network bandwidth for standard
networking and up to 200 Gbps with per VM Tier_1 networking performance for VM and
bare metal instances.
Before migrating to C4 or creating C4 VMs or bare metal
instances, make sure that the
operating system image
that you use supports the IDPF network driver for bare metal instances or the
gVNIC driver for VM instances. To get the best possible performance on
C4 VMs, choose an OS image that supports both
"Tier_1 Networking" and "200 Gbps network bandwidth". These images include an
updated gVNIC driver, even if the guest OS shows the gve driver version as
1.0.0. If your C4 VM is
using an operating system with an older version of gVNIC driver, this is still
supported but the VM might experience suboptimal performance such as less
network bandwidth or higher latency.
If you use a custom OS image to create a C4 VM, you can
manually install the most recent gVNIC driver .
The gVNIC driver version v1.4.2 or later is recommended for use with C4
VMs. Google recommends using the latest gVNIC driver version to benefit from
additional features and bug fixes.
Maintenance experience for C4 instances
During the lifecycle of a
Compute Engine instance , the host machine that your instance runs on undergoes multiple
host events .
A host event can include the regular maintenance of
Compute Engine infrastructure, or in rare cases, a host error. Compute Engine also
applies some non-disruptive lightweight upgrades for the hypervisor and network
in the background.
The C4 machine series offers the following features related to host
maintenance:

The maintenance frequencies shown in the previous table are approximations, not guarantees.
Compute Engine might occasionally perform maintenance more frequently.

Network support for N4D VMs
N4D instances require
gVNIC network interfaces .
N4D instances support up to 50 Gbps network bandwidth for standard
networking and don't support per VM Tier_1 networking performance.
Before migrating to N4D or creating N4D VM
instances, make sure that the
operating system image
that you use supports the gVNIC driver for VM instances.
These images include an
updated gVNIC driver, even if the guest OS shows the gve driver version as
1.0.0. If your N4D VM is
using an operating system with an older version of gVNIC driver, this is still
supported but the VM might experience suboptimal performance such as less
network bandwidth or higher latency.
If you use a custom OS image to create a N4D VM, you can
manually install the most recent gVNIC driver .
The gVNIC driver version v1.4.2 or later is recommended for use with N4D
VMs. Google recommends using the latest gVNIC driver version to benefit from
additional features and bug fixes.
Maintenance experience for N4D instances
During the lifecycle of a
Compute Engine instance , the host machine that your instance runs on undergoes multiple
host events .
A host event can include the regular maintenance of
Compute Engine infrastructure, or in rare cases, a host error. Compute Engine also
applies some non-disruptive lightweight upgrades for the hypervisor and network
in the background.
The N4D machine series offers the following features related to host
maintenance:
Machine type
Typical scheduled maintenance event frequency
Maintenance behavior
Advanced notification
On-demand maintenance
All N4D machine types
Variable
Live migrate
60 seconds
No
The maintenance frequencies shown in the previous table are approximations, not guarantees.
Compute Engine might occasionally perform maintenance more frequently.
N4A machine series
N4A VMs are the second family of VMs powered by Google's latest custom-designed
Axion processor, built on Arm Neoverse N3 compute core and powered by
Titanium IPU. N4A VMs are placed within a single node with
Uniform Memory Access (UMA) .
They are engineered to be our most efficient and flexible Arm VMs,
delivering exceptional price-performance for a wide range of general-purpose
and scale-out workloads. N4A uses next generation
dynamic resource management ,
which makes better use of resources on host machines.
Ideal use cases include web and application servers,
microservices, containerized applications using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), open-source
databases, and development and testing environments.
In summary, the N4A machine series:
Is powered by the Google Axion Arm processor and Titanium IPU.
Supports up to 64 vCPUs and 512 GB of DDR5 memory.
Offers multiple predefined machine types and
custom machine types with extended custom memory up
to 512 GB.
Supports standard network configuration with up to 50 Gbps of bandwidth.
Supports Hyperdisk only.
Supports the following discount and consumption options:
Resource-based and flexible committed use discounts (CUDs)
Spot VMs
Reservations
Doesn't support Local SSD or per VM Tier_1 networking performance.
Confidential VM is not supported by this CPU.
32-bit mode EL0 (guest userspace) is not supported due to a hardware
limitation.

Network support for N4 VMs
N4 instances require
gVNIC network interfaces .
N4 instances support up to 50 Gbps network bandwidth for standard
networking and don't support per VM Tier_1 networking performance.
Before migrating to N4 or creating N4 VM
instances, make sure that the
operating system image
that you use supports the gVNIC driver for VM instances.
These images include an
updated gVNIC driver, even if the guest OS shows the gve driver version as
1.0.0. If your N4 VM is
using an operating system with an older version of gVNIC driver, this is still
supported but the VM might experience suboptimal performance such as less
network bandwidth or higher latency.
If you use a custom OS image to create a N4 VM, you can
manually install the most recent gVNIC driver .
The gVNIC driver version v1.4.2 or later is recommended for use with N4
VMs. Google recommends using the latest gVNIC driver version to benefit from
additional features and bug fixes.
Maintenance experience for N4 instances
During the lifecycle of a
Compute Engine instance , the host machine that your instance runs on undergoes multiple
host events .
A host event can include the regular maintenance of
Compute Engine infrastructure, or in rare cases, a host error. Compute Engine also
applies some non-disruptive lightweight upgrades for the hypervisor and network
in the background.
The N4 machine series offers the following features related to host
maintenance:
Machine type
Typical scheduled maintenance event frequency
Maintenance behavior
Advanced notification
On-demand maintenance
All N4 machine types
Variable
Live migrate
60 seconds
No
The maintenance frequencies shown in the previous table are approximations, not guarantees.
Compute Engine might occasionally perform maintenance more frequently.
C3D machine series
C3D VMs are powered by the 4th generation AMD EPYC™ (Genoa) processor with
a maximum frequency of 3.7 Ghz. C3D machine types are optimized for the
underlying hardware architecture to deliver optimal, reliable, and consistent
performance.
C3D uses Titanium , which enables higher levels of
networking performance, isolation and security. The C3D machine series supports
Tier_1 networking bandwidth of up to 100 Gbps and up to 200 Gbps.
In summary, the C3D machine series:
Is powered by 4th generation AMD EPYC™ processor and Titanium.
Supports up to 360 vCPUs and 2,880 GB of DDR5 memory.
Supports standard network configuration with up to 100 Gbps bandwidth
and Tier_1 networking with up to 200 Gbps bandwidth.
Supports the following discount and consumption options:
Resource-based and flexible committed use discounts (CUDs)
Spot VMs
Reservations
Supports Confidential VM
with AMD SEV, excluding bare metal instances and configurations with more
than 255 vCPUs.
Caution : When you purchase resource-based commitments for C3 and C3D
resources, the machine family that is specified by the commitment type changes depending on
the interface:
In the gcloud CLI and REST, the commitment type values use
Compute-optimized as the machine family, even though C3 and C3D are part
of the general-purpose machine family.
In the Google Cloud console, the commitment type values use the correct machine
series: General-Purpose .
Make sure to select the correct commitment type value that corresponds to the interface that
you're using. For more information, see the
resource-based CUDs
documentation .
C3D machine types
C3D VMs are available in standard , highcpu , highmem , and lssd
configurations in sizes ranging from 4 to 360 vCPUs and up to 2,880 GB of
memory. The highcpu configuration offers the lowest price per performance for
compute-bound workloads that don't require large amounts of memory.

Supported disk types for C3D
C3D VMs support only the NVMe disk interface and can use the following block
storage types:
Balanced Persistent Disk ( pd-balanced )
SSD (performance) Persistent Disk ( pd-ssd )
Hyperdisk Balanced ( hyperdisk-balanced )
Hyperdisk Balanced High Availability ( hyperdisk-balanced-high-availability )
Hyperdisk ML ( hyperdisk-ml )
Hyperdisk Extreme ( hyperdisk-extreme )
Hyperdisk Throughput ( hyperdisk-throughput )
Local SSD (only available with -lssd machine types)
To use Local SSD with C3D, create your VM using the -lssd variant of the
C3D machine types. Selecting this machine type creates a VM of the specified
size with Local SSD partitions attached. You must use a machine type that ends
in -lssd to use Local SSD with your C3D VM; you can't attach Local SSD volumes
separately.
Disk and capacity limits
For instances running Microsoft Windows and using the NVMe disk interface, the
combined number of both Hyperdisk and Persistent Disk
attached volumes can't exceed a total of 16 disks.
See Known issues .
Local SSD volumes are excluded from this issue.

Network support for C3D VMs
C3D instances require
gVNIC network interfaces .
C3D supports up to 100 Gbps network bandwidth for standard
networking and up to 200 Gbps with per VM Tier_1 networking performance.
Before migrating to C3D or creating C3D instances,
make sure that the operating system image
that you use supports the gVNIC driver. To get the best possible performance on
C3D instances, on the Networking features
tab of the OS details table, choose an OS image that supports both
"Tier_1 Networking" and "200 Gbps network bandwidth". These images include an
updated gVNIC driver, even if the guest OS shows the gve driver version as
1.0.0. If your C3D instance is using an operating system with an older
version of the gVNIC driver, this is still supported but the instance might
experience suboptimal performance such as less network bandwidth or higher
latency.
If you use a custom OS image with the C3D machine series, you can
manually
install the most recent gVNIC driver .
The gVNIC driver version v1.4.2 or later is recommended for use with C3D
instances. Google recommends using the latest gVNIC driver version to benefit
from additional features and bug fixes.
Maintenance experience for C3D instances
During the lifecycle of a
Compute Engine instance , the host machine that your instance runs on undergoes multiple
host events .
A host event can include the regular maintenance of
Compute Engine infrastructure, or in rare cases, a host error. Compute Engine also
applies some non-disruptive lightweight upgrades for the hypervisor and network
in the background.
The C3D machine series offers the following features related to host
maintenance:
Machine type
Typical scheduled maintenance event frequency
Maintenance behavior
Advanced notification
On-demand maintenance

C3 machine series
C3 VMs are powered by the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors
(code-named Sapphire Rapids), DDR5 memory, and Titanium .
C3 machine types are optimized for the underlying NUMA architecture to deliver
optimal, reliable, and consistent performance.
The new C3 machine series is a major leap in our purpose-built infrastructure
offerings:
Leveraging Titanium processors to offload networking from the CPUs
Delivering high performance block-storage with Google Cloud Hyperdisk
Speeding up ML training and inference with Intel AMX
C3 uses Titanium to enable higher levels of networking performance, isolation
and security. The C3 machine series supports a default network bandwidth of up
to 100 Gbps and up to 200 Gbps with
per VM Tier_1 networking performance .
Titanium has been designed from the ground up to enable updates that don't
impact running workloads.
The C3 machine series provides some of the largest general-purpose machine
types, letting you create VM instances with up to 176 vCPUs and 1.4 TB of
memory.
C3 has bare metal machine types,
which allow you to access all the raw compute resources of the server. You can
create bare metal instances with 192 vCPUs and up to 1,536 GB of memory.
Bare metal instances also provide access to several onboard, function-specific
accelerators and offloads :
Intel-QAT
Intel-DLB
Intel DSA
Intel IAA
If your organization uses a Shielded VM policy, then you must create
a custom org policy that excludes bare metal shapes before you can create a
bare metal instance.
In summary, the C3 machine series:
Is powered by Intel 4th Generation Xeon processors and Titanium.
Supports up to 176 vCPUs and 1.4 TB of DDR5 memory for VMs.
Supports up to 192 vCPUs and 1,536 GB of memory for bare metal
instances.
Supports standard network configuration with up to 100 Gbps bandwidth
and Tier_1 networking with up to 200 Gbps bandwidth.
Supports Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX), a built-in accelerator
that significantly improves the performance of deep-learning training and
inference on the CPU.
Supports the following discount and consumption options:
Resource-based and flexible committed use discounts (CUDs)
Spot VMs
Reservations
Supports
Confidential VM
with Intel TDX.
Doesn't offer sustained use discounts (SUDs) .
C3 bare metal instances don't support the following:
Google Kubernetes Engine
Shielded VM
Nested virtualization
Caution : When you purchase resource-based commitments for C3 and C3D
resources, the machine family that is specified by the commitment type changes depending on
the interface:
In the gcloud CLI and REST, the commitment type values use
Compute-optimized as the machine family, even though C3 and C3D are part
of the general-purpose machine family.
In the Google Cloud console, the commitment type values use the correct machine
series: General-Purpose .
Make sure to select the correct commitment type value that corresponds to the interface that
you're using. For more information, see the
resource-based CUDs
documentation .
C3 machine types
C3 VMs are available in predefined machine types with sizes ranging from 4 to
176 vCPUs and up to 1,408 GB of memory.
To use Local SSD with C3, create your VM using the -lssd variant of the
C3 machine types. Selecting this machine type creates a VM of the specified
size with Local SSD partitions attached. You must use a c3-standard-*-lssd
machine type to use Local SSD with your VM; you can't attach Local SSD volumes
separately.
To create a bare metal instance with C3, use one of the following machine types:

C3 doesn't support custom machine types.
C3 regional availability for bare metal instances
For C3 VMs, you can view the available regions and zones in the
Regional availability of bare metal instances
table.
Supported disk types for C3
C3 VMs support only the NVMe disk interface and can use the following block
storage types:
VM instances
Zonal balanced Persistent Disk ( pd-balanced )
Zonal SSD (performance) Persistent Disk ( pd-ssd )
Hyperdisk Extreme ( hyperdisk-extreme )—Requires at least 64 vCPUs
Hyperdisk ML ( hyperdisk-ml )
Hyperdisk Throughput ( hyperdisk-throughput )
Hyperdisk Balanced ( hyperdisk-balanced )
Hyperdisk Balanced High Availability ( hyperdisk-balanced-high-availability )
Local SSD (only available with -lssd machine types)
Bare metal instances
Hyperdisk Balanced ( hyperdisk-balanced )
Hyperdisk Extreme ( hyperdisk-extreme )
Hyperdisk ML ( hyperdisk-ml )
A set amount of Local SSD disks are added to the C3 VM when you use the -lssd
machine type. This is the only way to include Local SSD storage with a C3 VM.
You can't use Local SSD disks with bare metal instances.
Disk and capacity limits
For instances running Microsoft Windows and using the NVMe disk interface, the
combined number of both Hyperdisk and Persistent Disk
attached volumes can't exceed a total of 16 disks.

Network support for C3 VMs
The following network interface drivers are required:
C3 instances require
gVNIC network interfaces .
C3 bare metal instances require the
Intel IDPF LAN PF device driver .
C3 supports up to 100 Gbps network bandwidth for standard
networking and up to 200 Gbps with per VM Tier_1 networking performance for VM and
bare metal instances.
Before migrating to C3 or creating C3 VMs or bare metal
instances, make sure that the
operating system image
that you use supports the IDPF network driver for bare metal instances or the
gVNIC driver for VM instances. To get the best possible performance on
C3 VMs, choose an OS image that supports both
"Tier_1 Networking" and "200 Gbps network bandwidth". These images include an
updated gVNIC driver, even if the guest OS shows the gve driver version as
1.0.0. If your C3 VM is
using an operating system with an older version of gVNIC driver, this is still
supported but the VM might experience suboptimal performance such as less
network bandwidth or higher latency.
If you use a custom OS image to create a C3 VM, you can
manually install the most recent gVNIC driver .
The gVNIC driver version v1.4.2 or later is recommended for use with C3
VMs. Google recommends using the latest gVNIC driver version to benefit from
additional features and bug fixes.
Maintenance experience for C3 instances

N2 machine series
The N2 machine series has flexible sizing between 2 to 128 vCPUs and 0.5 to
8 GB of memory per vCPU. Machine types in this series run on the
following processors:
Ice Lake—offered in specific
regions and zones . It is
the default processor for larger machine types.
Cascade Lake—the default for machine types up to 80 vCPUs. If you want
to create VMs with Ice Lake , you must set it as the
minimum CPU platform .
You can find more details about these two processors on the
CPU platforms page.
Workloads that can take advantage of the higher clock frequency are a good
choice for this series. These workloads can get higher per-thread
performance while benefiting from all the flexibility that the general-purpose
machine family offers.
In summary, the N2 machine series:
Supports up to 128 vCPUs and 864 GB of memory.
Supports 50 Gbps, 75 Gbps, and 100 Gbps
high-bandwidth network configurations .
Is available in predefined and custom VMs .
Has higher memory-to-core ratios for VMs created with the extended memory
feature. Using the extended memory feature helps control per-CPU software
licensing costs while providing access to more than 8 GB of memory per
vCPU.
Supports the following discount and consumption options:
Resource-based and flexible committed use discounts (CUDs)
Sustained use discounts (SUDs)
Spot VMs
Reservations
N2 machine types
The amount of memory configured per vCPU differs depending on the machine type:

E2 machine series
The cost-optimized E2 machine series have between 2 to 32 vCPUs with a
ratio of 0.5 GB to 8 GB of memory per vCPU for standard VMs, and 0.25 to 1 vCPUs
with 0.5 GB to 8 GB of memory for shared-core E2 machine types. The E2 machine
series offers both Intel and AMD EPYC processors. The processor is selected
for you at the time of VM creation. Machine types in this series are available
in all regions and zones and support a virtio memory balloon
device .
In summary, the E2 machine series:
Supports up to 32 vCPUs and 128 GB of memory.
Supports Intel and AMD EPYC Milan processors.
Is available in predefined and custom VMs .
Offers the lowest on demand pricing across the general-purpose machine types.
Supports the following discount and consumption options:
Resource-based and flexible committed use discounts (CUDs)
Spot VMs
Reservations
Doesn't offer sustained use discounts (SUDs) ;
however, it provides consistently low on-demand and committed-use pricing.
Doesn't support GPUs, Local SSDs, sole-tenant nodes, or nested
virtualization.
Shared-core VMs
E2 shared-core machine types are cost-effective, have a virtio memory balloon
device, and are ideal for small workloads. The E2 machine series shared-core
machine types use context-switching for multi-tasking, and time-share a single
physical core for a specific fraction of time. Different shared-core machine
types sustain different amounts of time on a physical core.
e2-micro sustains 2 vCPUs, each for 12.5% of
CPU time
totaling 25% CPU time.
e2-small sustains 2 vCPUs, each at 25% of
CPU time, totaling 50% CPU time.
e2-medium sustains 2 vCPUs, each at 50% of
CPU time, totaling 100% CPU time.
Unlike predefined machine types and custom machine types, shared-core machine
types have a predefined price that includes both vCPUs and memory. For more
information, see
VM instance pricing .
CPU bursting
Shared-core machine types offer bursting capabilities that allow instances
to use additional physical CPU for short periods of time. Bursting happens automatically when your
VM requires more physical CPU than originally allocated. During these
spikes, each vCPU can burst up to 100% of CPU time, for short periods, before returning to their
normal CPU time sharing limitations. Note that bursts are not permanent and are only possible
periodically.
e2-micro , e2-small , and e2-medium
shared-core VMs can burst for dozens of seconds. If the CPU is utilized at 100%, then the burst
lasts as follows:
e2-micro : 30 seconds
e2-small : 60 seconds
e2-medium 120 seconds
The exact burst time is determined by a
Token bucket
meaning utilizing the CPU less than 100% will result in longer bursts.
Bursting doesn't incur any additional charges. You are charged the listed on-demand
price for E2 shared-core and N1 f1-micro , and g1-small shared-core VMs.
E2 Limitations
The E2 machine series doesn't offer sustained use discounts (SUDs); however,
it provides consistently low on-demand and committed-use pricing.
The E2 machine series doesn't support GPUs, Local SSDs, sole-tenant nodes,
or nested virtualization.
E2 machine types
E2 is available in standard , highmem , and highcpu configurations, as well
as shared-core machine type. In general, E2 shared-core machine types can be
more cost-effective for running small, non-resource intensive applications than
standard, high-memory, or high-CPU machine types.
The amount of memory configured per vCPU differs depending on the machine type:
standard : 4 GB of system memory per vCPU
highmem : 8 GB of system memory per vCPU
highcpu : 1 GB of system memory per vCPU
Shared core:
micro : 0.5 GB of system memory per vCPU
small : 1 GB of system memory per vCPU
medium : 2 GB of system memory per vCPU

‡ You can attach a mixture of Hyperdisk
and Persistent Disk volumes to a VM, but the total Persistent Disk capacity can't exceed
257 TiB.
Custom machine types
If none of the predefined machine types in the general-purpose machine family
match your workload needs, you can create a VM with a custom machine type.
Creating a VM with a custom machine type is ideal for workloads that require
more processing power or more memory, but don't need all of the upgrades that
are provided by the next larger predefined machine type.
It costs slightly more to use a custom machine type than an equivalent
predefined machine type, and there are limitations in the amount of memory and
vCPUs that you can select. The on-demand prices for custom machine types include
a 5% premium over the on-demand and commitment prices for predefined machine
types.
You can create a VM with a custom machine type for only the N and E
machine series in the general-purpose machine family. Custom machine types are
not available for the C and Tau machine series. Custom machine types are subject
to the same Persistent Disk limits as E2, N2, and N1 predefined machine types. The
maximum total Persistent Disk size for each VM is 257 TiB and the max number of
Persistent Disk is 128. N4, N4A, and N4D custom machines types are subject to the
limitations of
Hyperdisk capacity
If a custom machine type doesn't meet your requirements, it's possible to
customize the number of visible CPU cores
on many machine types. It's also possible to
set the number of threads per core
for certain machine types. You can make these changes during VM instance
creation, or by editing an existing VM instance. Reducing the number of visible
cores might impact the cost of your VMs. Be sure to review
pricing prior to
making any changes.
Review the following table for the custom machine type limits for each machine
series.
N4A custom machine types
For N4A custom machine types, you can create a machine type with 1 to
64 vCPUs and memory between 2 and 512 GB. vCPU and memory can be adjusted
in increments of 1 vCPU and 1 GB, respectively.
By default, the memory per vCPU that you can select for a custom machine
type is determined by the machine series you use. For the N4A machine series,
select between 2 GB and 8 GB per vCPU. You can access more memory beyond the
default option by enabling
extended memory.
N4A custom machine types are available only in select
regions and zones.
Examples of invalid machine types:
2 vCPUs, 0.5 GB of total memory . Invalid because the total memory
is less than the minimum 2 GB and does not use an increment of 1 GB for an N4A
VM.
100 vCPUs, 200 GB of memory . Invalid because the vCPU count is too
large. N4A custom machine types can use a maximum of 64 vCPUs.
Examples of valid machine types:
36 vCPUs, 72 GB of total memory . Valid because the amount of
memory per vCPU is within the acceptable range of 2 GB to 8 GB per vCPU.
5 vCPUs, 14 GB of total memory . Valid because it has 5 vCPUs, which
is in the acceptable range of 1 to 64 vCPUs, and the amount of memory per vCPU
uses an increment of 1 GB and is within the acceptable range of 2 GB to 8 GB
per vCPU.
N4D custom machine types
The maximum number of vCPUs allowed for a custom machine type is determined
by the machine series you choose. For the N4D machine series, which supports
the AMD EPYC Turin platform, you can deploy custom machine types with 2
to 96 vCPUs and 1 to 768 GB of memory.
You can create N4D custom machine types with 2, 4, 8, or 16 vCPUs. After
16, you can increment the number of vCPUs by 16, up to 96 vCPUs. The minimum
acceptable number of vCPUs is 2.
By default, the memory per vCPU that you can select for a custom machine
type is determined by the machine series you choose. For N4D
machine types, select between 0.5 GB and 8 GB per vCPU in 256 MB
increments. Higher amounts of memory are possible by enabling
extended memory.
N4D custom machine types are available only in select
regions and zones.
N4D custom machine types are available only with standard networking with a
maximum egress limits of 50 Gbps.
Examples of invalid machine types:
2 vCPUs, 0.4 GB of total memory . Invalid because the total
memory is less than the minimum 1 GB for an N4D VM and not in
increments of 256 MB.
34 vCPUs, 34 GB of total memory . Invalid because the total
number of vCPUs is not divisible by 16.
1 vCPU, 1024 MB of memory . Invalid because the vCPU count is too
small. N4D custom machine types require a minimum of 2 vCPUs.
Examples of valid machine types:
32 vCPUs, 16 GB of total memory . Valid because the total number
of vCPUs is a multiple of 16 and the total memory is a multiple of 256 MB.
The amount of memory per vCPU is 0.5 GB, which satisfies the minimum
requirement. Because the number of vCPUs is larger than 8 vCPUs,
the number of vCPUs must be divisible by 16.
2 vCPUs, 7 GB of total memory . Valid because it has 2 vCPUs,
which is the minimum value, and the total memory is a multiple of 256 MB.
The amount of memory per vCPU is also within the acceptable range of
0.5 GB to 8 GB per vCPU.
N4 custom machine types
For N4 custom machine types, you can create a machine type with 2 to 80
vCPUs with the vCPUs in multiples of 2, and memory between 4 and 640 GB.
By default, the memory per vCPU that you can select for a custom machine
type is determined by the machine series you use. For the N4 machine series,
select between 2 GB and 8 GB per vCPU in 256 MB increments. When creating a
standard N4 machine type, the minimum memory you can select is 4 GB.
Higher amounts of memory are possible by enabling
extended memory.
Examples of invalid machine types:
2 vCPUs, 0.5 GB of total memory . Invalid because the total memory
is less than the minimum 4 GB for an N4 VM.
1 vCPU, 8 GB of memory . Invalid because the vCPU count is too
small. N4 custom machine types require a minimum of 2 vCPUs.
Examples of valid machine types:
36 vCPUs, 72 GB of total memory . Valid because the total number of
vCPUs is even and the total memory is a multiple of 256 MB. The amount of
memory per vCPU is also within the acceptable range of 2 GB to 8 GB per vCPU.
2 vCPUs, 14 GB of total memory . Valid because it has 2 vCPUs, which is the
minimum value, and the total memory is a multiple of 256 MB. The amount of
memory per vCPU is also within the acceptable range of 2 GB to 8 GB per vCPU.
N2D custom machine types
The maximum number of vCPUs allowed for a custom machine type is determined
by the machine series you choose. For the N2D machine series, which supports
the AMD EPYC Milan platform, you can deploy custom machine types with 2
to 96 vCPUs.
You can create N2D custom machine types with 2, 4, 8, or 16 vCPUs. After
16, you can increment the number of vCPUs by 16, up to 96 vCPUs. The minimum
acceptable number of vCPUs is 2.
By default, the memory per vCPU that you can select for a custom machine
type is determined by the machine series you choose. For N2D
machine types, select between 0.5 GB and 8.0 GB per vCPU in 256 MB
increments. Higher amounts of memory are possible by enabling
extended memory.
N2D custom machine types are available only in select
regions and zones.
N2D custom machine types support per VM Tier_1 networking performance
maximum egress limits of 50 Gbps to 100 Gbps. When enabled:
VMs with 48 to 94 vCPUs have a total egress limit of 50 Gbps.
VMs with 96 vCPUs have a total egress limit of 100 Gbps.
Examples of invalid machine types:
2 vCPUs, 0.4 GB of total memory . Invalid because the total
memory is less than the minimum 1 GB for an N2D VM.
34 vCPUs, 34 GB of total memory . Invalid because the total
number of vCPUs is not divisible by 16.
1 vCPU, 1024 MB of memory . Invalid because the vCPU count is too
small. N2D custom machine types require a minimum of 2 vCPUs.
Examples of valid machine types:
32 vCPUs, 16 GB of total memory . Valid because the total number
of vCPUs is even and the total memory is a multiple of 256 MB. The
amount of memory per vCPU is 1 GB, which satisfies the minimum
requirement. Because the number of vCPUs is larger than 8 vCPUs,
the number of vCPUs must be divisible by 16.
2 vCPUs, 7 GB of total memory . Valid because it has 2 vCPUs,
which is the minimum value, and the total memory is a multiple of 256 MB.
The amount of memory per vCPU is also within the acceptable range of 1 GB
to 8 GB per vCPU.
N2 custom machine types
For N2 custom machine types, you can create a machine type with 2 to 80
vCPUs and memory between 1 and 864 GB. For machine types with up to
32 vCPUs, you can select a vCPU count that is a multiple of 2. For machine
types with greater than 32 vCPUs, you must select a vCPU count that is a
multiple of 4 (for example, 36, 40, 56, or 80).
You can create N2 custom machine types on different processors:
Cascade Lake , the 2nd generation of the Intel Xeon processor.
This is the default processor for N2 custom machine types
with less than 80 vCPUs.
Ice Lake , the 3rd generation of the Intel Xeon processor. Ice
Lake processors are available in specific
regions and zones .
By default, the memory per vCPU that you can select for a custom machine
type is determined by the machine series you use. For the N2 machine series,
select between 0.5 GB and 8.0 GB per vCPU in 256 MB increments. Higher amounts of
memory are possible by enabling
extended memory.
N2 custom machine types have an option for a per VM Tier_1 networking performance maximum
egress of 50 Gbps to 100 Gbps with a minimum of 30 vCPUs.
32 to 62 vCPUs have a total egress of 50 Gbps
64 to 78 vCPUs have a total egress of 75 Gbps
80 vCPUs have a total egress of 100 Gbps
Examples of invalid machine types:
2 vCPUs, 0.5 GB of total memory . Invalid because the total
memory is less than the minimum 1 GB for an N2 VM.
34 vCPUs, 34 GB of total memory . Invalid because the total
number of vCPUs is not divisible by 4.
1 vCPU, 1024 MB of memory . Invalid because the vCPU count is too
small. N2 custom machine types require a minimum of 2 vCPUs.
Examples of valid machine types:
36 vCPUs, 18 GB of total memory . Valid because the total
number of vCPUs is even and the total memory is a multiple of 256 MB.
The amount of memory per vCPU is also within the acceptable range of
0.5 GB to 8 GB per vCPU. Because the number of vCPUs is larger
than 32 vCPUs, the number of vCPUs must be divisible by 4.
2 vCPUs, 7 GB of total memory . Valid because it has 2 vCPUs,
which is the minimum value, and the total memory is a multiple of
256 MB. The amount of memory per vCPU is also within the acceptable
range of 0.5 GB to 8 GB per vCPU.
E2 custom machine types
E2 custom machine types support predefined platforms with Intel or AMD EPYC
processors.
You can create E2 custom machine types with vCPUs in multiples of 2, up to 32
vCPUs. The minimum acceptable number of vCPUs for a VM is 2.
By default, the general-purpose machine series you choose determines the
memory per vCPU that you can select for a custom machine type. For E2, the
ratio of memory per vCPU is 0.5 GB to 8 GB inclusive. When creating a standard
E2 machine type, the minimum memory you can select is 1 GB.
An exception to the minimum vCPU limitation is to create an e2-standard-2
VM, then customize the visible core to 1 vCPU. The resulting VM is an
e2-custom VM. For example, you create an E2 VM using the
e2-standard-2 machine type, stop the VM, and edit it by
changing the visible core to 1 vCPU with 1.25 GB of memory. As a result, the
machine type changes to e2-custom-2-1280 . Pricing is described
in the
Customize the number of visible CPU cores document.
Examples of invalid machine types:
1 vCPU, 1024 MB of memory . Invalid because the vCPU count is too
small. E2 custom machine types require a minimum of 2 vCPUs.
32 vCPUs, 1 GB of total memory . Invalid because the ratio of vCPUs
to memory is incorrect. The acceptable ratio is 0.5 GB of memory to 1
vCPU.
Examples of valid machine types:
32 vCPUs, 16 GB of total memory . Valid because the total number of
vCPUs is even and the total memory is an acceptable ratio of memory to vCPU.
2 vCPUs, 8 GB of total memory . Valid because it has 2 vCPUs, which
is the minimum value, and the total memory is a multiple of 256 MB. The
amount of memory per vCPU is also within the acceptable range of 0.5 GB to
8 GB per vCPU.
E2 shared-core custom machine types
E2 shared-core machine types support predefined Intel or AMD EPYC
processors, which are preselected for you at the time of VM creation. You can
create shared-core machine types with a vCPU range of 0.25 to 1 vCPU. The
memory range is 1 to 8 GB, with a maximum ratio of 8 GB per vCPU.
You can't customize the number of visible cores on a shared-core E2 VM.
e2-micro : 0.25 vCPU, 1 to 2 GB of memory
e2-small : 0.50 vCPU, 1 to 4 GB of memory
e2-medium : 1 vCPU, 1 to 8 GB of memory
N1 custom machine types
You can create N1 custom machine types with 1 or more vCPUs. For VMs with
more than 1 vCPU, you must increment the number of vCPUs by 2, up to 96 vCPUs
for Intel Skylake platform,or up to 64 vCPUs for Intel Broadwell, Haswell,
or Ivy Bridge CPU platforms.
By default, the memory per vCPU that you can select for a custom machine
type is determined by the machine series you choose. For N1 machine types,
select between 0.9 GB and 6.5 GB per vCPU, inclusive. N1 custom machine
types with 1 or 2 vCPUs require a minimum of 1 GB per vCPU.
Higher amounts of memory are possible by enabling extended memory.
Examples of invalid machine types:
1 vCPU, 0.2 GB of total memory . Invalid because the total memory is
less than the minimum 1 GB for an N1 VM.
3 vCPU, 1 GB of total memory . Invalid because the number of vCPU
cores must be 1 or an even number up to 96.
Examples of valid machine types:
32 vCPUs, 29 GB of total memory . Valid because the total number of
vCPUs is even and the total memory is a multiple of 256 MB. The total
memory is an acceptable ratio of memory to vCPU.
1 vCPU, 1 GB of total memory . Valid because it has one vCPU,
which is the minimum value, and the total memory is a multiple of 256 MB.
The amount of memory per vCPU is also within the acceptable range of 1 GB
to 6.5 GB per vCPU.
