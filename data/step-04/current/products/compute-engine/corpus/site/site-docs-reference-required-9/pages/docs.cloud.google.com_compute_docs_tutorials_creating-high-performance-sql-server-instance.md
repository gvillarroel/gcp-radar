This tutorial shows how to create a Compute Engine VM instance running
SQL Server that is optimized for performance. This tutorial guides you through
creating the instance and then configuring SQL Server for optimal performance on
Google Cloud. You will learn about a number of configuration options that
are available to help you adjust the performance of the system.
This tutorial uses SQL Server Standard Edition 2022, so not every configuration
option presented in this guide works for everyone, and not all of them provide
noticeable performance benefits for every workload.

Creating the Compute Engine VM with disks
To create a high-performance SQL Server instance, you must first create a VM
instance with SQL Server and two Persistent Disk volumes.
Persistent Disk considerations
To select the type of Persistent Disk volumes for your VM, review the
following considerations:
A Local SSD disk
provides a high-performance location for tempdb and the Windows pagefile.
There are some important considerations to note when using a Local SSD disk.
When you shut down your instance from Windows or reset it by using the API,
the Local SSD disk is removed. This action renders the instance unbootable.
To get the machine running again, you would need to detach your persistent
disks, create a new instance with them, and then define a new Local SSD disk.
After startup you would also need to format the new disk and reboot.
Therefore, you shouldn't permanently store critical data on a Local SSD disk,
or power off the instance, unless you are prepared to rebuild it.
An SSD Persistent Disk
provides high-performance storage for the database files.
Persistent Disk performance is based on a calculation that uses the number of
CPUs and the size of the disk. With 32 vCPUs and a 1 TB disk, the
performance peaks at 40,000 read operations per second (ops) and 30,000
write ops. The total sustained throughput for reads and writes is 800 MB per
second and 400 MB per second respectively. These measurements represent a
summation of all the Persistent Disk volumes attached to the virtual machine,
including the C:\ drive. To ensure consistent performance, create a
Local SSD disk and offload all the IOPS needed for the paging file,
tempdb , staging data, and backups.
To read more about disk performance, see Configure disks to meet performance requirements .
Creating Compute Engine VM with disks
To create a VM that has SQL Server 2022 Standard preinstalled on Windows Server
2022, follow these steps:

Configuring Windows
Now that you have a working instance running SQL Server, connect to your
instance and configure the Windows operating system. After that, you learn to
configure SQL Server in an upcoming section.
Connect to your instance
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page.
Go to VM instances
Under the Name column, click the name of your instance, ms-sql-server .
At the top of the instance's details page, click the
Set Windows Password button.
Specify a username.
Click Set to generate a new password for this Windows instance.
Note the username and password so you can log into the instance.
Connect to your instance by using RDP .
Setting up disk volumes
Create and format the volumes:
From the Start menu, search for "Computer Management" and then open it.
Under Storage section, select Disk Management .
When prompted to initialize disks, accept the default selections and click OK .
Create partition for Local SSD disk(s):
To locate a Local SSD disk, right-click on a disk and select Properties .
The Local SSD disk properties name will be Google EphemeralDisk for a SCSI
interface or nvme_card for an NVMe interface. Both Local SSD disks and
persistent SSDs are marked as having Unallocated partitions.
If the VM contains only 1 Local SSD drive, follow these steps:
Under the list of disk drives, right-click the 374.98 GB local SSD
disk and select New Simple Volume .
On the Welcome screen, click Next to start the disk volume
wizard.
In the Specify Volume Size step, leave the volume size at the
default value and click Next to proceed.
In the Assign Drive Letter or Path step, choose P: for the
drive letter and click Next to proceed.
In the Format Volume step, change the Allocation unit size
to 8192 and enter "pagefile" for the Volume label . Click
Next to proceed.
Click Finish to complete the disk volume wizard.
If the VM contains multiple local SSD drives, follow these steps:
Under the list of disk drives, right-click the first 374.98 GB local
SSD disk and select New Striped Volume .
On the Welcome screen, click Next to start the disk volume
wizard.
In the Select Disks step, add all the available disks with the
size 383,982 MB to the Selected section. Click Next to proceed.
In the Assign Drive Letter or Path step, choose P: for the
drive letter and click Next to proceed.
In the Format Volume step, change the Allocation unit size
to 8192 and enter "pagefile" for the Volume label . Click
Next to proceed.
Click Finish to complete the disk volume wizard.
Repeat the previous steps to create a New Simple Volume for the SSD disk,
with the following three changes:
Choose D: for the drive letter.
Set the Allocation unit size to 64k .
For details on selecting an allocation unit size, see
Best practices for SQL Server instances .
Enter sqldata for the Volume label .
Moving the Windows paging file
Now that the new volumes are created and mounted, move the Windows paging file
onto the Local SSD disk, which frees up Persistent Disk IOPS and improves the access
time of your virtual memory.
From the Start menu, search for View advanced system settings and
then open the dialog.
Click the Advanced tab, and in the Performance section, click
Settings .
In the Virtual memory section, click the Change button.
Clear the checkbox Automatically manage paging file size for all drives . The
system should have already set up your paging file on the C:\ drive, and you
need to move it.
Click C: and then click the No paging file radio button.
Click the Set button.
To create the new paging file, click the P: drive, and then click the
System managed size radio button.
Click the Set button.
Click OK three times to exit the advanced system properties.
Microsoft Support has published additional tips for virtual memory
settings .
Setting the power profile
Set the power profile to High-Performance instead of Balanced .
From the Start menu, search for "Choose a Power Plan", and then open the
power options.
Select the High Performance radio button.
Exit the dialog.
Configuring SQL Server
Use SQL Server Management Studio to perform most administrative tasks. The
preconfigured images for SQL Server come with Management Studio already
installed. Launch Management Studio and then click Connect to
connect to the default database.
Moving the data and log files
The preconfigured image for SQL Server comes with everything installed on
the C:\ drive, including the system databases. To optimize your setup,
move those files to the new D:\ drive you created. Also remember to create
all new databases on the D:\ drive. Because you are using an SSD, you don't
need to store the data files and log files on separate disk partitions.
There are two ways to move the installation to the secondary disk: using the
installer or moving the files manually.
Using the installer
To use the installer, run c:\setup.exe and select a new installation path on
your secondary disk.
Moving the files manually
Move the system databases and configure SQL Server to save the data and log
files on the same volume:
Create a new folder named D:\SQLData .
Open a Command Window.
Enter the following command to grant full access to NT Service\MSSQLSERVER :
icacls D : \ SQLData / Grant "NT Service\MSSQLServer:(OI)(CI)F"
Use Management Studio and the following guides to move your system
databases
and change the default file locations
for new databases.
If you plan on using Report Server features, move the ReportServer
and ReportServerTempDB files as well.
Important: Don't modify the tempdb files yet because you must first change
some permission settings and then move the DB to the Local SSD volume.
After you move the primary configuration database files and restart, you need to
configure the system to point to the new location for the model and MSDB
databases. Here is a helper script to run in Management Studio:
ALTER DATABASE model MODIFY FILE ( NAME = modeldev , FILENAME = 'D:\SQLData\model.mdf' )
ALTER DATABASE model MODIFY FILE ( NAME = modellog , FILENAME = 'D:\SQLData\modellog.ldf' )
ALTER DATABASE msdb MODIFY FILE ( NAME = MSDBData , FILENAME = 'D:\SQLData\MSDBData.mdf' )
ALTER DATABASE msdb MODIFY FILE ( NAME = MSDBlog , FILENAME = 'D:\SQLData\MSDBLog.ldf' )
After you execute these commands:
Use the services.msc snap-in to stop the SQL Server database service.
Use the Windows file explorer to move the physical files from the C:\ drive
where the master database was located to the D:\SQLData directory.
Start the SQL Server database service.
Setting system permissions
After moving the system databases, modify some additional settings, starting
with permissions for the Windows user account created to run your SQL
Server process, which is named NT Service\MSSQLSERVER .
Granting the Lock Pages in Memory permission
The group policy Lock Pages in Memory permission prevents Windows from
moving pages in physical memory to virtual memory. To keep physical
memory free and organized, Windows tries to swap old, rarely modified pages to
the virtual-memory paging file on disk.
SQL Server stores important information in memory, such as table structures,
execution plans, and cached queries. Some of this information rarely changes, so
it becomes a target for the paging file. If this information gets moved to the
paging file, SQL Server performance can degrade. Granting the group policy Lock
Pages in Memory permission for SQL Server's service account prevents this
swapping.
Follow these steps:
Click Start and then search for Edit Group Policy to open the console.
Expand
Local Computer Policy >
Computer Configuration >
Windows Settings > Security Settings >
Local Policies >
User Rights Assignment .
Search for and then double-click Lock pages in memory .
Click Add User or Group .
Search for "NT Service\MSSQLSERVER".
If you see multiple names, double-click the MSSQLSERVER name.
Click OK twice.
Keep the Group Policy Editor console open.
Important: After completing these steps and restarting SQL Server, you can
verify the setting is working by viewing the SQL Server log. The log contains an
entry such as, "Using locked pages in the memory manager."
Granting the Perform volume maintenance tasks permission
By default, when an application requests a slice of disk space from Windows, the
operating system locates an appropriately sized chunk of disk space, and then
zeroes out the entire chunk of disk, before handing it back to the application.
Because SQL Server is good at growing files and filling disk space, this
behavior is not optimal.
There is a separate API for allocating disk space to an application, often
referred to as instant file initialization . Unfortunately, this setting only
works for data files, but you will learn in an upcoming section about log-file
growth. Instant file initialization requires the service account running the SQL
Server process to have another group policy permission, called Perform volume
maintenance tasks .
In the Group Policy Editor , search for "Perform volume maintenance tasks".
Add the "NT Service\MSSQLSERVER" account as you did in the previous section.
Restart the SQL Server process to activate both settings.
Setting up tempdb
It used to be a best practice to optimize the SQL Server
CPU usage by creating one tempdb file per CPU. However, because CPU counts
have grown over time, following this guideline can cause performance to
decrease. As a good starting point, use 4 tempdb files. As you measure your
system's performance, in rare cases you might need to incrementally increase the
number of tempdb files to a maximum of 8.
You can run a Transact-SQL (T-SQL) script inside SQL Server Management Studio to
move the tempdb files to a folder in the `p:` drive.
Create the directory p:\tempdb .
Grant full security access to the "NT Service\MSSQLSERVER" user account:
icacls p : \ tempdb / Grant "NT Service\MSSQLServer:(OI)(CI)F"
Run the following script inside SQL Server Management Studio, to move the tempdb data file and log file:
USE master
GO
ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] MODIFY FILE (NAME = tempdev, FILENAME = 'p:\tempdb\tempdb.mdf')
GO
ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] MODIFY FILE (NAME = templog, FILENAME = 'p:\tempdb\templog.ldf')
GO
Restart SQL Server.
Run the following script to modify the file sizes and create three additional data files for the new tempdb .
ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] MODIFY FILE (NAME = tempdev, FILENAME = 'p:\tempdb\tempdb.mdf', SIZE=8GB)
ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] MODIFY FILE (NAME = templog, FILENAME = 'p:\tempdb\templog.ldf' , SIZE = 2GB)
ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] ADD FILE (NAME = 'tempdev1', FILENAME = 'p:\tempdb\tempdev1.ndf' , SIZE = 8GB, FILEGROWTH = 0);
ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] ADD FILE (NAME = 'tempdev2', FILENAME = 'p:\tempdb\tempdev2.ndf' , SIZE = 8GB, FILEGROWTH = 0);
ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] ADD FILE (NAME = 'tempdev3', FILENAME = 'p:\tempdb\tempdev3.ndf' , SIZE = 8GB, FILEGROWTH = 0);
GO
If you use SQL Server 2016, there are 3 additional tempdb files to remove
after you do the previous steps:
ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] REMOVE FILE temp2;
ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] REMOVE FILE temp3;
ALTER DATABASE [tempdb] REMOVE FILE temp4;
Restart SQL Server again.
Delete the model , MSDB , master , and tempdb files from the original
location on the C:\ drive.
You successfully moved your tempdb files onto the Local SSD disk partition.
This move carries some risks, mentioned earlier, but if they are lost for any
reason,SQL Server rebuilds the tempdb files. Moving tempdb gives you the
added performance of the Local SSD, and decreases the IOPS used on your
Persistent Disk volumes.
Caution: Local SSD is not intended for storage of permanent or critical data,
because the disk is pinned to the local host. Therefore, use Local SSD only
for temporary storage. In some cases, if you shut down Windows from within the
instance, the Local SSD disk is also removed, and you have to delete and
recreate your instance.
Setting max degree of parallelism
The recommended default setting for max degree of parallelism is to match it
to the number of CPUs on the server. However, there is a point where executing a
query in 16 or 32 parallel chunks and merging the results is much slower than
running it in a single process. If you are using a 16- or 32-core instance, you
can set the max degree of parallelism value to 8 using the following T-SQL:
USE master
GO
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
GO
RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE
GO
EXEC sp_configure 'max degree of parallelism', 8
GO
RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE
GO
Setting max server memory
This setting defaults to a very high number, but you should set it to the number
of megabytes of available physical RAM, minus a couple gigabytes for operating
system and overhead. The following T-SQL example adjusts max server memory to
100 GB. Modify it to adjust the value to match your instance. Review the
Server memory server configuration options document
for more information.
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
GO
RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE
GO
exec sp_configure 'max server memory', 100000
GO
RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE
GO
Finishing up
Restart the instance one more time to make sure all of the new settings take
effect. Your SQL Server system is configured and you are ready to create your
own databases and start testing your specific workloads. Review the SQL Server
Best Practices guide
for more information on operational activities, other performance
considerations, and Enterprise Edition capabilities.
Clean up
After you finish the tutorial, you can clean up the resources that you created so that they
stop using quota and incurring charges. The following sections describe how to delete or turn off
these resources.
Deleting the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Deleting instances
To delete a Compute Engine instance:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
VM instances page.
Go to VM instances
Select the checkbox for
the instance that you want to delete.
To delete the instance, click more_vert More actions , click Delete ,
and then follow the instructions.
Deleting Persistent Disk volumes
To delete the Persistent Disk:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Disks page.
Go to Disks
Select the checkbox next to the name of the disk you want to
delete.
Click the Delete button at the top of the page.
