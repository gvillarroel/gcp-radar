Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial shows how to use HammerDB to perform load testing on a
Compute Engine SQL Server instance. You can learn how to install
a SQL Server instance by using the following tutorials:
Creating SQL Server instances
Creating a high-performance SQL Server instance
There are a number of load-testing tools available. Some are free and open
source, while others require licenses.
HammerDB
is an open source tool that generally works well to
demonstrate the performance of your SQL Server database. This tutorial covers
the basic steps to use HammerDB, but there are other tools available, and you
should select the tools that align best to your specific workloads.
Objectives
This tutorial covers the following objectives:
Configuring SQL Server for load testing
Installing and running HammerDB
Collecting runtime statistics
Running the Transaction Processing Benchmark derived from the TPC "C" specification (TPROC-C) load test
Costs
In addition to any existing SQL Server instances running on
Compute Engine, this
tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud, including:
Compute Engine
Windows Server
The Pricing Calculator can generate a cost
estimate based on your projected usage. The provided link shows the cost
estimate for the products used in this tutorial, which can average 16 dollars
(US) per day.

Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

If you aren't using Windows on your local machine, install a third-party
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client. For more information, see Microsoft Remote Desktop clients .
Configuring the SQL Server instance for load testing
Before you start, you should double check that your Windows firewall
rules
are set up to allow traffic from the IP address of the new Windows instance you
created. Then, create a new database for TPCC load testing and configure a user
account using the following steps:
Right-click the Databases folder in SQL Server Management Studio, and
then choose New Database .
Name the new database "TPCC".
Set the initial size of the data file to 190,000 MB and the log file to
65,000 MB.
Set the Autogrowth limits to higher values by clicking the ellipsis
buttons, as shown in the following screenshot:
Set the data file to grow by 64 MB to unlimited size.
Set the log file to disable auto-growth.
Click OK .
In the New Database dialog, in the left pane, choose the Options
page.
Set Compatibility level to SQL Server 2022 (160) .
Set the Recovery model to Simple , so that the loading doesn't fill up
the transaction logs.
Click OK to create the TPCC database, which can take a few minutes to
complete.
The preconfigured SQL Server image comes with only Windows Authentication
enabled, so you will need to enable mixed mode authentication within SSMS, by
following
this guide .
Follow these steps
to create a new SQL Server user account on your database server that has the
DBOwner permission. Name the account "loaduser" and give it a secure
password.
Take note of your SQL Server internal IP address by using the
Get-NetIPAddress commandlet, because it's important for performance and security
to use the internal IP.
Installing HammerDB
You can run HammerDB directly on your SQL Server instance. However, for a more
accurate test, create a new Windows instance and test the SQL Server instance
remotely.
Note: You might need to disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security
Configuration
before downloading files to your Windows Server instance.
Creating an instance
Follow these steps to create a new Compute Engine instance:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create an instance page.
Go to Create an instance
For Name , enter hammerdb-instance .
In the Machine configuration section, select the
machine type with at least half the number of CPUs as your database
instance.
In the Boot disk section, click Change , and then do the following:
On the Public images tab, choose a Windows Server operating system.
In the Version list, click Windows Server 2022 Datacenter .
In the Boot disk type list, select Standard persistent disk .
To confirm your boot disk options, click Select .
To create and start the VM, click Create .
Installing the software
When it's ready, use an RDP client to connect to your new Windows Server instance
and install the following software:
ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server
HammerDB for Windows 64-bit
Running HammerDB
After you install HammerDB, run the hammerdb.bat file. HammberDB does
not show up in the Start menu's applications list. Use the following command
to run HammerDB:
Note: In this tutorial we've used HammerDB 4.10. If you are using a later version some options may have changed.
C:\Program Files\HammerDB- VERSION \hammerdb.bat
Replace VERSION with the version of the installed
HammerDB.
Creating the connection and schema
When the application is running, the first step is to configure the connection
to build the schema.
Double-click SQL Server in the Benchmark panel.
Select TPROC-C .
From the HammerDB site :
TPROC-C is the OLTP workload implemented in HammerDB derived from the TPROC-C specification with modification to make running HammerDB straightforward and cost-effective on any of the supported database environments. The HammerDB TPROC-C workload is an open source workload derived from the TPROC-C Benchmark Standard and as such is not comparable to published TPROC-C results, as the results comply with a subset rather than the full TPROC-C Benchmark Standard. The name for the HammerDB workload TPROC-C means "Transaction Processing Benchmark derived from the TPC "C" specification".
Click OK
Click Schema and then double-click Options .
Fill out the form using your IP address, username, and password as shown in the following image:
Set the SQL Server ODBC Driver to OBDC Driver 18 for SQL Server
In this case, the Number of Warehouses (the scale) is set to 460, but
you can choose a different value. Some guidelines suggest 10 to 100 warehouses
per CPU. For this tutorial, set this value to 10 times the number of cores:
160 for a 16-core instance.
For Virtual Users to Build Schema , choose a number that is between 1- and
2-times the number of client vCPUs. You can click the grey bar next to the
slider to increment the number.
Clear the Use BPC Option
Click OK
Double-click the Build option below the Schema Build section to
create the schema and load the tables. When that completes, click the red
flash light icon in the top center of the screen to destroy the virtual user
and move to the next step.
Note: If the build fails due to the SQL Server ODBC Driver, open the
ODBC Data Sources application in Windows and check the available ODBC drivers
under the Drivers tab.
If you created your database with the Simple recovery model, you might
want to change it back to Full at this point to get a more accurate test of a
production scenario. This change doesn't take effect until after you take a
full or differential backup to trigger the start of the new log chain.
Important: If you plan to run multiple tests, make a full backup of your new
TPROC-C database ,
so that you can restore it later. Backing up can save you time compared to
creating the database again by using the tool. If you revert the database to a
Full recovery model, you should backup the transaction logs to clear them out
after each test.
Creating the driver script
HammerDB uses the driver script to orchestrate the flow of SQL
statements to the database to generate the required load.
In the Benchmark panel, expand the Driver Script section and
double-click Options .
Verify the settings match what you used in the Schema Build dialog.
Choose Timed Driver Script .
The Checkpoint when complete option forces the database to write
everything to disk at the end of the test, so check this only if you plan on
running multiple tests in a row.
To ensure a thorough test, set Minutes of Rampup Time to 5 and
Minutes for Test Duration to 20.
Click OK to exit the dialog.
Double-click Load in the Driver Script section of the Benchmark
panel to activate the driver script.
Creating virtual users
Creating a realistic load typically requires running scripts as multiple
different users. Create some virtual users for the test.
Expand the Virtual Users section and double-click Options .
If you set your warehouse count (scale) to 160, then set the
Virtual Users to 16, because the TPROC-C guidelines recommend a 10x ratio
to prevent row locking. Select the Show Output checkbox to enable error
messages in the console.
Click OK
Collecting runtime statistics
HammerDB and SQL Server don't easily collect detailed runtime statistics for
you. Although the statistics are available deep within SQL Server, they need to
be captured and calculated on a regular basis. If you do not already have a
procedure or tool to help capture this data, you can use the procedure in this
section to capture some useful metrics during your testing. The results will be
written to a CSV file in the Windows temp directory. You can copy the data to
a Google Sheet using the Paste Special > Paste CSV option.
To use this procedure, you first must temporarily enable
OLE Automation Procedures to write the file to disk.
Remember to disable it after testing:
sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
GO
RECONFIGURE;
GO
sp_configure 'Ole Automation Procedures', 1;
GO
RECONFIGURE;
GO
Note: Although this procedure is very small, it can affect the total throughput
reported by a fraction of a percent.
Here's the code to create the sp_write_performance_counters procedure in SQL
Server Management Studio. Before starting the load test, you will execute this
procedure in Management Studio.:
USE [master]
GO
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO
/***
LogFile path has to be in a directory that SQL Server can Write To.

GO
Running the TPROC-C load test
In SQL Server Management Studio, execute the collection procedure using the
following script:
Use master
Go
exec dbo.sp_write_performance_counters
On the Compute Engine instance where you installed HammerDB, start
the test in the HammerDB application:
In the Benchmark panel, under Virtual Users double-click Create
to create the virtual users, which will activate the Virtual User Output
tab.
Double-click Run just below the Create option to kick off the test.
When the test completes you will see the Transactions Per Minute (TPM)
calculation in the Virtual User Output tab.
You can find the results from your collection procedure in the
c:\Windows\temp directory.
Save all of these values to a Google Sheet and use them to compare multiple
test runs.
Clean up
After you finish the tutorial, you can clean up the resources that you created so that they
stop using quota and incurring charges. The following sections describe how to delete or turn off
these resources.
Deleting the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Deleting instances
To delete a Compute Engine instance:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
VM instances page.
Go to VM instances
Select the checkbox for
the instance that you want to delete.
To delete the instance, click more_vert More actions , click Delete ,
and then follow the instructions.
