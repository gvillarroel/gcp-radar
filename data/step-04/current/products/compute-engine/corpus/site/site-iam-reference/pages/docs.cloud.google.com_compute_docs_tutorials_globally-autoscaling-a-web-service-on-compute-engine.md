Globally autoscaling a web service on Compute Engine
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial shows how to set up a globally available web service with regional
Compute Engine
managed instance groups
that automatically scale to meet capacity needs.
You can use the techniques shown in this tutorial for implementing your own
globally distributed and scalable project on Compute Engine.
Objectives
Deploy multiple regional Compute Engine managed instance groups with
autoscaling enabled.
Create a cross-region load balancer.
Generate test traffic from different regions across the globe.
Use the
Google Cloud console
to visualize how the load balancer routes requests and how the instance
groups autoscale to meet demand.
Costs
This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud including:
Compute Engine
Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Compute Engine API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Application architecture
The application includes the following Compute Engine components:
Instance template :
A template used to create each instance in the instance groups.
Instance groups :
Multiple instance groups that autoscale based on incoming traffic.
Load balancer :
An HTTP load balancer that distributes traffic among the instance groups.
Instances :
Multiple testing instances to generate test traffic from different parts
of the globe.
Note: For more information about geographical regions and zones, see the
documentation for
Regions and Zones .
Set up the web service
Create the instance groups
Console
Create a network for the instance groups.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC networks page.
Go to VPC networks
Click Create VPC Network .
Set the Name to fortressnet .
Set Subnet creation mode to Automatic .
Click Create at the bottom of the page.
Create a firewall rule for the network. This rule will allow all HTTP
requests sent to your instances.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Firewall rules page.
Go to Firewall rules
Click Create Firewall Rule .
Set the Name to fortressnet-allow-http .
For Network select fortressnet .
For Targets select All instances in the network .
Set Source IPv4 ranges to 0.0.0.0/0 .
For Protocols and ports , choose Specified protocols and ports
and then select the tcp checkbox and enter 80 .
Click Create .
Create an instance template. Include a startup script that starts up a
simple Apache web server on each instance.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Instance templates page.
Go to Instance templates
Click Create instance template .
Set the Name to fort-template .
For Machine configuration , select e2-micro (2 vCPU, 1 GB memory).
In the Advanced options section, expand
Networking , and then do the following:
In the Network interfaces section, expand the network
interface to edit it.
For Network , select fortressnet .
In the Management section, for Automation enter the following
Startup script :
apt update && apt -y install apache2
Click Create .
Create multiple regional managed instance groups using the instance
template. Configure autoscaling for each instance group.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Instance groups page.
Go to Instance groups
Click Create instance group to create a new managed instance
group.
Select New managed instance group (stateless) .
Set the Name to us-central1-pool .
For Instance template , select fort-template .
For Location , select Multiple zones .
For Region , select us-central1 . For Zones , leave the
predefined values selected.
For Autoscaling mode , select On: add and remove instances to
the group .
Set Minimum number of instances to 1 .
Set Maximum number of instances to 5 .
For Autoscaling signals , edit the default selection (CPU
utilization) and set the Signal type to HTTP load balancing
utilization .
Set Target HTTP load balancing utilization to 80 .
Click Done .
Click Create . A dialog displays the message that you must also
assign the instance group to a backend service of an HTTP load
balancer.
In the confirmation dialog, click Confirm . You can
configure the load balancer
after you create all the instance groups.
Repeat these steps to create two more instance groups with the
following changes:
Create a group with Name as europe-west1-pool and Region
as europe-west1 .
Create a group with Name as asia-east1-pool and Region
as asia-east1 .
Note: Autoscaling of instance groups can be based on different
criteria. Because your web service employs a Load Balancer , your
autoscalers should be configured to scale based on
load balancing usage . For more information, see
Scaling based on load balancing serving capacity .
(Optional) Verify the instances are healthy and serving HTTP traffic.
Test the external IP address of one or more instances. You might need to
wait a minute for the instances to finish the startup process.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page.
Go to VM instances
Verify that each running instance has a green checkmark in the
Status column next to the name of your instance group.
Copy an instance's External IP and paste it into a web browser.
You should see the 'Apache2 Debian Default Page' web page.
If it doesn't seem to work, try waiting a few moments.
gcloud
Create a network for the instance groups.
gcloud compute networks create fortressnet --subnet-mode auto
Create a firewall rule for the network. This rule will allow all HTTP
requests sent to your instances.
gcloud compute firewall-rules create fortressnet-allow-http \
--network fortressnet \
--allow tcp:80
Create an instance template. Include a startup script that starts up a
simple Apache web server on each instance.
gcloud compute instance-templates create fort-template \
--machine-type e2-micro \
--network fortressnet \
--metadata startup-script='apt update && apt -y install apache2'
Create multiple regional managed instance groups using the instance
template. Configure autoscaling for each instance group.
gcloud compute instance-groups managed create us-central1-pool \
--region us-central1 \
--template fort-template \
--size 1
gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling us-central1-pool \
--region us-central1 \
--min-num-replicas 1 \
--max-num-replicas 5 \
--scale-based-on-load-balancing \
--target-load-balancing-utilization .8
gcloud compute instance-groups managed create europe-west1-pool \
--region europe-west1 \
--template fort-template \
--size 1
gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling europe-west1-pool \
--region europe-west1 \
--min-num-replicas 1 \
--max-num-replicas 5 \
--scale-based-on-load-balancing \
--target-load-balancing-utilization .8
gcloud compute instance-groups managed create asia-east1-pool \
--region asia-east1 \
--template fort-template \
--size 1
gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling asia-east1-pool \
--region asia-east1 \
--min-num-replicas 1 \
--max-num-replicas 5 \
--scale-based-on-load-balancing \
--target-load-balancing-utilization .8
Note: Autoscaling of instance groups can be based on different
criteria. Because your web service employs a Load Balancer , your
autoscalers should be configured to scale based on
load balancing usage . For more information, see
Scaling based on load balancing serving capacity .
(Optional) Verify the instances are healthy and serving HTTP traffic.
Test the external IP address of one or more instances. You might need to
wait a minute for the instances to finish the startup process.
List your instances.
gcloud compute instances list
Verify under the STATUS column that the instances are RUNNING .
Check an instance by querying it's IP address under the EXTERNAL_IP
column.
curl http:// EXTERNAL_IP | head
You should see some HTML text, including the line
<title>Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works</title> .
If it doesn't seem to work, try waiting a few moments.
Note: You can create an autoscaler with multiple signals. So even
though you need to scale based on load balancing usage to work with your
Load Balancer , at the same time you can also autoscale based on CPU
utilization, Cloud Monitoring metrics, or schedules. For more information,
see Using an autoscaling policy with multiple signals .
Configure the load balancer
The load balancer will distribute client requests among your multiple backends.
Console
Select the load balancer type
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Load balancing page.
Go to Load balancing
Click Create load balancer .
For Type of load balancer , select Application Load Balancer
(HTTP/HTTPS) and click Next .

Click Done .
Click Add backend .
Under the New backend dialog box, set Instance group to
us-central1-pool .
For Balancing mode select Rate .
Set Maximum RPS to 100 RPS per instance.
Click Done .
Under Health check , select Create a health check .
Set the Name to http-basic-check .
For Protocol select HTTP .
Set Port to 80 .
Click Save and continue .
Click Create .
Note: Load balancing of requests between backends can be based on
different criteria. For more information see the documentation for the
Load distribution algorithm .
Host and path rules
On the left panel of the Create global external Application Load Balancer page, click Host
and path rules .
For this example, we don't need to configure any host or path
rules since all traffic will go to the default rule. So, we can accept
the pre-populated default values .
Frontend configuration
On the left panel of the Create global external Application Load Balancer page, click
Frontend configuration .
Set Name to fortressnet-http-rule .
For IP version select IPv4 .

Click Reserve and wait a few moments.
Click Done at the bottom of the New Frontend IP and port dialog
box.
Review and finalize
On the left panel of the Create global external Application Load Balancer page, click
Review and finalize .
Compare your settings to what you intended to
create.
If the settings are correct, click Create at the bottom of the left
panel. You are returned to the Load balancing screen. After the load
balancer is created, a green check mark next to it indicates that it is
running.
gcloud
Backend configuration
Create a basic health check. This will check whether a load balancer
backend is responding to HTTP requests.
gcloud compute health-checks create http http-basic-check
Create a global backend service. This backend service will receive HTTP
traffic from the load balancer.
gcloud compute backend-services create fortressnet-backend-service \
--protocol HTTP \
--health-checks http-basic-check \
--global
Add the instance groups as regional backends of the backend service.
This configuration will distribute traffic among the backends based on a
maximum number of requests per second (RPS) per instance.
gcloud compute backend-services add-backend fortressnet-backend-service \
--balancing-mode RATE \
--max-rate-per-instance 100 \
--instance-group us-central1-pool \
--instance-group-region us-central1 \
--global
gcloud compute backend-services add-backend fortressnet-backend-service \
--balancing-mode RATE \
--max-rate-per-instance 100 \
--instance-group europe-west1-pool \
--instance-group-region europe-west1 \
--global
gcloud compute backend-services add-backend fortressnet-backend-service \
--balancing-mode RATE \
--max-rate-per-instance 100 \
--instance-group asia-east1-pool \
--instance-group-region asia-east1 \
--global
Note: Load balancing of requests between backends can be based on
different criteria. For more information see the documentation for the
Load distribution algorithm .
Host and path rules
Define a URL map. URL maps route different URLs to different backend
services. Since we only have one backend service, we'll simply set that
backend service as the default service for all URLs.
gcloud compute url-maps create fortressnet-balancer \
--default-service fortressnet-backend-service
Create an HTTP proxy route. HTTP proxy routes accept HTTP requests and
route them according to your URL map. In this case, it will send all
requests to your single backend service.
gcloud compute target-http-proxies create fortressnet-http-proxy \
--url-map fortressnet-balancer
Frontend configuration
Create two global static external IP addresses: one for IPv4 and one for
IPv6. These will be the global external IP addresses of the load
balancer.
gcloud compute addresses create fortressnet-ip \
--ip-version IPV4 \
--network-tier=PREMIUM \
--global
gcloud compute addresses create fortressnet-ipv6 \
--ip-version IPV6 \
--network-tier=PREMIUM \
--global
Lookup the external IP addresses of the load balancer.
gcloud compute addresses list
Create global forwarding rules for the external IP addresses. This will
forward both IPv4 and IPv6 HTTP requests to your HTTP proxy.
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create fortressnet-http-rule \
--load-balancing-scheme=EXTERNAL \
--network-tier=PREMIUM \
--global \
--target-http-proxy fortressnet-http-proxy \
--ports 80 \
--address LOAD_BALANCER_IP_ADDRESS
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create fortressnet-http-ipv6-rule \
--load-balancing-scheme=EXTERNAL \
--network-tier=PREMIUM \
--global \
--target-http-proxy fortressnet-http-proxy \
--ports 80 \
--address LOAD_BALANCER_IPV6_ADDRESS
Note: Notice that each backend now has a load balancer balancing mode and an
instance group autoscaler policy . These two mechanisms work together to
properly distribute load among the backends. For more information read the
documentation for
Backend services and autoscaled managed instance groups .
(Optional) Verify the load balancer is working. You may need to wait a minute
or three.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Load balancing page.
Go to Load balancing
Wait for fortressnet-balancer to have a green check mark under the
Backends column.
Click on fortressnet-balancer .
Under Frontend copy the IPv4 address under the IP:Port column.
(IPv4 addresses are of the form www.xxx.yyy.zzz . You don't need the
trailing port number :nn .) If the Frontend section is missing, try
waiting a few moments and then reloading the web page.
Enter the IP address in a web browser.
You should see the 'Apache2 Debian Default Page' web page.
If you get an 'Error 404 (Not Found)' web page instead, try waiting a few
more minutes.
gcloud
Lookup the external IP addresses of the load balancer.
gcloud compute addresses list
Query the IPv4 address. (IPv4 addresses are of the form
www.xxx.yyy.zzz .)
curl http:// LOAD_BALANCER_IP_ADDRESS | head
You should see some HTML text, including the line
<title>Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works</title> .
If you see <title>Error 404 (Not Found)!!1</title> instead, try waiting a
few more minutes.
Best Practice: Create a secure firewall to allow only internal traffic from the
load balancer and the health check. Then delete the original firewall that
allowed any HTTP request. This prevents individual instances from being
accessible by outside clients.
Console
Create a new firewall only allowing traffic from the load balancer and
the health check.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Firewall rules page.
Go to Firewall rules
Click Create Firewall Rule .
Set the Name to fortressnet-allow-load-balancer .
For Network select fortressnet .
For Targets select All instances in the network .
For Source IP ranges type 130.211.0.0/22 and press the
Enter key, then type 35.191.0.0/16 and press Enter again.
Under Protocols and ports select tcp and enter 80 .
Click Create .
Delete the old allow-everything firewall.
Select the checkmark next to fortressnet-allow-http .
Click Delete at the top of the page.
In the dialog box, click Delete .
gcloud
Create a new firewall only allowing traffic from the load balancer and
the health check.
gcloud compute firewall-rules create fortressnet-allow-load-balancer \
--network fortressnet \
--source-ranges 130.211.0.0/22,35.191.0.0/16 \
--allow tcp:80
Delete the old allow-everything firewall.
gcloud compute firewall-rules delete fortressnet-allow-http -q
Note: 130.211.0.0/22 and 35.191.0.0/16 are noteworthy source IPs.
130.211.0.0/22 is the source IP for any request redirected by a
Compute Engine Load Balancer . 35.191.0.0/16 is the source IP
for any request sent by a Compute Engine Health Check . For more
information, see the documentation for
Load balancing firewall rules .
(Optional) Verify that autoscaling and load balancing works
Generate some test traffic
Suppose it is morning in Europe and your web service suddenly goes viral on the
internet. Generate a high number of client requests all at once from Europe.
Console
Create an instance installed with the Siege load testing tool.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create an instance page.
Go to Create an instance
Set the Name to europe-loadtest .
For Region select europe-west1 .
For advanced settings, expand the Advanced options
section, and do the following:
Expand the Management section.
In the Automation field, enter the following startup
script:
apt -y install siege
To create the VM, click Create .
Get the IPv4 address of the load balancer.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Load balancing page.
Go to Load balancing
Click fortressnet-balancer .
Under Frontend copy the IPv4 address under the IP:Port column.
(IPv4 addresses are of the form www.xxx.yyy.zzz .)
SSH into the load testing instance.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page.
Go to VM instances
Wait for the europe-loadtest instance to have a green checkmark
under the Name column.
Click SSH on europe-loadtest under the Connect column.
Start siege. Target the IPv4 address of the load balancer.
siege -c150 http:// LOAD_BALANCER_IP_ADDRESS
gcloud
Create an instance installed with the Siege load testing tool.
gcloud compute instances create europe-loadtest \
--network default \
--zone europe-west1-c \
--metadata startup-script='apt -y install siege'
Get the IPv4 address of the load balancer.
gcloud compute addresses list
Open a new shell session where the gcloud command is available.
Note: If you are using Cloud Shell, you can open multiple shell sessions
in the same browser window. See the Cloud Shell documentation on
Opening Multiple Sessions .
In your new shell session, SSH into the load testing instance.
gcloud compute ssh --zone europe-west1-c europe-loadtest
Start siege. Target the IPv4 address of the load balancer.
siege -c150 http:// LOAD_BALANCER_IP_ADDRESS
After running the siege command you should see output declaring
The server is now under siege...
[alert] Zip encoding disabled; siege requires zlib support to enable it
** SIEGE 4.0.2
** Preparing 150 concurrent users for battle.
The server is now under siege...
Monitor load balancing and autoscaling
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Load balancing page.
Go to Load balancing
Click the load balancer named fortressnet-balancer .
Click the Monitoring tab.
In the Backend drop-down, select fortressnet-backend-service .
It may take up to ten minutes to display enough data. Soon you should see a
display similar to the following:
What's happening here:
The load test starts sending a large amount of traffic all at once. At first,
the load balancer distributes requests equally among the three backends. The
number of requests quickly exceeds your autoscaling limits, and may even
cause your servers to return Backend 5xx errors which will show up on the
monitoring display. The autoscaler starts to spin up additional instances as
needed.
Autoscaling catches up with capacity needs. To minimize request latency,
Compute Engine load balancers try to route requests to the backend that
is closest to the client. In this case, since the load test traffic
originates from Europe, the load balancer prefers to route more requests to
the Europe backend. As a result, autoscaling may spin up more instances in
the Europe backend to handle a higher fraction of requests.
Generate test traffic somewhere else
Suppose your web service also catches on in Asia with the afternoon internet
crowd. Generate a high number of requests from Asia.
Console
To create another instance installed with the Siege load testing tool, do
the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page.
Go to VM instances
Click Create instance .
Set the Name to asia-loadtest .
For Region select asia-east1 .
Expand the Advanced options section.
Expand the Management section.
In the Automation section, enter the following startup script:
apt -y install siege
Click Create .
To get the IP address of the load balancer, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Load balancing page.
Go to Load balancing
Click fortressnet-balancer .
Under Frontend copy the IPv4 address under the IP:Port
column. (IPv4 addresses are of the form www.xxx.yyy.zzz .)
SSH into the load testing instance.
Wait for the asia-loadtest instance to have a green checkmark under
the Name column.
Click SSH on asia-loadtest under the Connect column.
Start siege. Target the IPv4 address of the load balancer.
siege -c150 http:// LOAD_BALANCER_IP_ADDRESS
gcloud
In your original shell session, create another instance installed with
the Siege load testing tool.
gcloud compute instances create asia-loadtest \
--network default \
--zone asia-east1-c \
--metadata startup-script='apt -y install siege'
Get the IPv4 address of the load balancer.
gcloud compute addresses list
Open a new shell session where the gcloud command is available.
In your new shell session, SSH into the load testing instance.
gcloud compute ssh --zone asia-east1-c asia-loadtest
Start siege. Target the IPv4 address of the load balancer.
siege -c150 http:// LOAD_BALANCER_IP_ADDRESS
Again, you should see output declaring The server is now under siege...
[alert] Zip encoding disabled; siege requires zlib support to enable it
** SIEGE 4.0.2
** Preparing 150 concurrent users for battle.
The server is now under siege...
Monitor load balancing and autoscaling
Go back to the load balancing monitoring display from last time. It may take up
to ten minutes to display enough new data. Soon you should see a display similar
to the following:
What's happening here:
Again, the load test sends another large number of requests all at once. At
first the load balancer distributes requests equally among the existing three
backends. As the number of requests exceeds your autoscaling limits, the
autoscaler starts to spin up additional instances as needed.
Autoscaling catches up with the new capacity needs. The load balancer still
prefers to route requests to the nearest available backends. As a result,
eventually the Asia backend receives requests mostly from Asia, the
Europe backend receives requests mostly from Europe, and the US backend
receives everything else.
Clean up
After you finish the tutorial, you can clean up the resources that you created so that they
stop using quota and incurring charges. The following sections describe how to delete or turn off
these resources.
Deleting the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Deleting instances
To delete a Compute Engine instance:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
VM instances page.
Go to VM instances
Select the checkbox for
the instance that you want to delete.
To delete the instance, click more_vert More actions , click Delete ,
and then follow the instructions.
