Managed constraints
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Managed constraints are predefined organization policies, built on a modern
platform, that provide centralized, programmatic control over your
Compute Engine resources. They include built-in support for safe rollout tools
like Policy Simulator and dry run.
Managed constraints are identifiable by the compute.managed.* prefix and serve
as a direct replacement for legacy compute.* constraints.
Benefits
Safe rollout and monitoring : Implement policies with full tooling, faster
change control, and deploy gradually using simulation and dry-run capabilities.
Consistent logging : Enforces uniformity in logging and error messages,
simplifying centralized monitoring and streamlining audits.
Policy inheritance
Organization policies that you set on a resource are inherited by that
resource's descendants in the resource hierarchy. For example, if you enforce
a policy on a folder, Google Cloud enforces the policy on all projects in that
folder.
Pricing
The Organization Policy Service, including predefined (legacy), managed, and custom
organization policies, is offered at no charge.
Before you begin
If you haven't already, set up authentication .
Authentication verifies your identity for access to Google Cloud services and APIs. To run
code or samples from a local development environment, you can authenticate to
Compute Engine by selecting one of the following options:
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Console
When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
gcloud
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
After installation,
initialize the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
Set a default region and zone .
REST
To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the
credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Authenticate for using REST
in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.
Ensure that you know your
organization ID .
If you haven't already, install the
gcloud CLI and initialize it by running
gcloud init .
Set a default project for your testing.

Available managed constraints
The following managed organization policy constraints are available for
Compute Engine:
Constraint
Description
Allowed VLAN Attachment encryption settings
This list constraint defines the allowed encryption settings for new VLAN Attachments. By default, VLAN Attachments are allowed to use any encryption settings. Set IPSEC as the allowed value to enforce creating encrypted VLAN attachments only.
constraints/compute.managed.allowedVlanAttachmentEncryption
Block Compute Engine Preview Features
This constraint ensures that preview features are blocked unless this constraint is explicitly allowed. Once set to allow, you can control which preview features can individually be enabled or disabled for your project. Only enabled preview features can be accessed in the project. Subsequently disabling the policy does not change the status of individual preview features already set & they can be individually disabled. This constraint only applies to Compute Alpha API features.
constraints/compute.managed.blockPreviewFeatures
Block Project-wide SSH Keys
Preview: This constraint prevents the block-project-ssh-keys metadata key from being set to false at the project, project-zonal, or instance level for Compute Engine VMs within the organization, project, or folder where this constraint is enforced. By default, project-wide SSH keys are allowed and can be disabled at the project, project-zonal, or instance level using this metadata key. To allow project-wide SSH keys for specific VMs, you can exempt them from this policy using tags and conditional rules. Important: Enforcing this constraint does not affect existing VMs where block-project-ssh-keys is already set to false; they will retain access unless their metadata is updated.
constraints/compute.managed.blockProjectSshKeys
Disable Guest Attributes of Compute Engine metadata
Preview: This constraint, when enforced, disables Compute Engine API access to the Guest Attributes of Compute Engine VMs. By default, the Compute Engine API can be used to access Compute Engine VM guest attributes. You can allow specific VM instances to use guest attributes. First apply tags to mark the instances, and then use conditional rules based on tag values to properly scope those instances out of enforcement.
constraints/compute.managed.disableGuestAttributesAccess
Disable VM Nested Virtualization
This boolean constraint disables hardware-accelerated nestedvirtualization for all Compute Engine VMs belonging to the organization, project, or folder where this constraint is set to True . By default, hardware-accelerated nested virtualization is allowed for all Compute Engine VMs running on Intel Haswell or newer CPU platforms.
constraints/compute.managed.disableNestedVirtualization
Disable Non-FIPS Compliant Machine Types
Preview: This constraint, when enforced, prevents the creation or update of VM instances using machine types that are not FIPS compliant. By default, all machine types are allowed. You can exempt specific VMs using tags and conditional rules.
constraints/compute.managed.disableNonFIPSMachineTypes
Restrict enabling VM serial port access metadata
This constraint prevents the serial-port-enable metadata key from being set to true for Compute Engine VMs within the organization, project, or folder where this constraint is enforced. By default, serial port access can be enabled on a per-VM, per-zone, or per-project basis using this metadata key. To allow serial port access for specific VMs, you can exempt them from this policy using tags and conditional rules. Important: Enforcing this constraint does not affect existing VMs where serial-port-enable is already set to true; they will retain access unless their metadata is updated.
constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortAccess
Disable VM serial port logging to Stackdriver
This constraint, when enforced, disables serial port logging to Stackdriver from Compute Engine VMs. By default, serial port logging for Compute Engine VMs is disabled, and can be selectively enabled on a per-VM or per-project basis using metadata attributes . Disabling serial port logging can cause certain services that rely on it, such as Google Kubernetes Engine clusters, to not function correctly. Before you enforce this constraint, verify that the products in your project do not rely on serial port logging. You can allow specific VM instances to use serial port logging. First apply tags to mark the instances, and then use conditional rules based on tag values to properly scope those instances out of enforcement.
constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortLogging
Disable creation of Compute Engine instances that use the deprecated container startup agent (konlet).
Preview: This boolean constraint prevents the creation of Compute Engine instances that use konlet, the deprecated container startup agent. When enabled, you can't create compute instances that have the `gce-container-declaration` metadata key.This constraint also prevents creation of compute instances from instance templates that contain the `gce-container-declaration` metadata key, which affects managed instance groups (MIGs) that use such instance templates.
constraints/compute.managed.disableVmsWithContainerStartupAgent
Restricts usage of Global Internal DNS (gDNS) for projects that have a ZonalOnly DNS setting.
This constraint, when enforced, restricts gDNS usage. This restriction disables gDNS VM creation and updating VMs to use gDNS. Reverting a zDNS project to gDNS won't be blocked, but lead to policy violation enforcement during subsequent Instance API invocations.
constraints/compute.managed.disallowGlobalDns
Require OS Config
This constraint, when enforced, requires enablement of VM Manager (OS Config) on all new projects. On new and existing projects, this constraint prevents metadata updates that disable VM Manager at the project, project-zonal, or instance level. You can allow specific VM instances to disable VM Manager. First apply tags to mark the instances, and then use conditional rules based on tag values to properly scope those instances out of enforcement.
constraints/compute.managed.requireOsConfig
Require OS Login
This constraint, when enforced, requires enablement of OS Login on all newly created Projects. On new and existing projects, this constraint prevents metadata updates that disable OS Login at the project, project-zonal, or instance level. You can allow specific VM instances to disable OS Login. First apply tags to mark the instances, and then use conditional rules based on tag values to properly scope those instances out of enforcement.
constraints/compute.managed.requireOsLogin
Restrict Non-Confidential Computing
Preview: Requires all new VMs to be created with Confidential Computing enabled. By default, new VMs are not required to use Confidential Computing. You can apply/exempt this constraint by using tags to mark VM Instances and then enforcing the constraint with conditional rules based on the applied tags.
constraints/compute.managed.restrictNonConfidentialComputing
Restricts the use of protocol forwarding
This constraint lets you restrict the types of protocol forwarding deployments (internal or external) that can be created in your organization. To configure the constraint, you specify an allowlist of the type of protocol forwarding deployment to be allowed. The allowlist can only include the following values: INTERNAL
EXTERNAL
. For example, if the allowlist is set to INTERNAL, your users can only set up internal protocol forwarding. That is, any forwarding rules associated with target instances are restricted to the INTERNAL load balancing scheme and must use only internal IP addresses.
constraints/compute.managed.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes
Restrict VM IP forwarding
This constraint defines whether Compute Engine VM instances can enable IP forwarding. By default, if no policy is specified, any VM can enable IP forwarding in any virtual network. If enforced, this constraint will deny the creation or update of VM instances with IP forwarding enabled. You can allow specific VM instances to enable IP forwarding. First apply tags to mark the instances, and then use conditional rules based on tag values to properly scope those instances out of enforcement.
constraints/compute.managed.vmCanIpForward
Restrict External IPs For VM instances
This constraint defines whether Compute Engine VM instances are allowed to use IPv4 external IP addresses. By default, all VM instances are allowed to use external IP addresses. If enforced, this constraint will deny the creation or update of VM instances with IPv4 external IP addresses. This constraint will not restrict the usage of IPv6 external IP addresses. You can allow specific VM instances to use external IPv4 IP addresses. First apply tags to mark the instances, and then use conditional rules based on tag values to properly scope those instances out of enforcement.
constraints/compute.managed.vmExternalIpAccess
Hierarchical metadata evaluation
Managed constraints that rely on predefined metadata keys, such as OS Login or
Serial Port Access, support hierarchical evaluation. When Compute Engine
evaluates these constraints, it checks metadata values set at the VM instance,
project, or zonal level.
Setting metadata values at the project or zonal level lets you manage VM
instances at scale. However, constraint enforcement occurs only during VM
instance creation or update API calls. Thus, changes to project or zonal
metadata affect a VM instance's constraint compliance only when that instance is
created or updated.

Safe rollout: The policy lifecycle
To prevent service disruptions when you gradually implement new constraints, Google
recommends that you implement managed constraints by following these steps:
Analyze with Policy Simulator
Before enforcing a policy, use Policy Simulator to see which existing resources
violate the policy. Follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Organization Policies page.
Go to Organization Policies
In the filter bar, search for your constraint, then click the constraint name
to go to its Policy details page.
Click Test Changes to generate a simulation report.
Hierarchical metadata changes might take a few hours to reflect on the
simulation report for constraints on VM metadata settings.
Review the report to reconfigure non-compliant resources or request
exemptions.
Validate with dry run
Dry run mode logs violations to Cloud Logging but doesn't enforce restrictions.
To test a constraint, use the gcloud org-policies set-policy command as follows:
Create a policy YAML file (for example, dry-run-policy.yaml ) with a
dryRunSpec :
name : projects/ PROJECT_ID /policies/compute.managed.requireOsLogin
dryRunSpec :
rules :
- enforce : true
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Apply the policy:
gcloud org-policies set-policy dry-run-policy.yaml
Full enforcement
After you simulate and test your policy, you can enforce it on a resource.
Policy changes can take up to 15 minutes to propagate across all
Google Cloud systems.
Test constraint enforcement
After setting a policy, you can verify enforcement using the
gcloud CLI. For example, to test the
compute.managed.requireOsLogin constraint, follow these steps:
List existing policies to confirm your configuration:
gcloud org-policies list --project = PROJECT_ID
Apply the enforcement policy using a YAML file:
gcloud org-policies set-policy enforce_managed_constraint.yaml
Verify enforcement by calling a mutation API. Attempting to create a
VM instance with non-compliant metadata should fail:
gcloud compute instances create VM_NAME \
--machine-type = MACHINE_TYPE \
--image-family = IMAGE_FAMILY \
--image-project = IMAGE_PROJECT \
--metadata = enable-oslogin = false
Replace the following:
VM_NAME : the name for the new VM instance.
MACHINE_TYPE : a valid machine type, for example, e2-micro .
IMAGE_FAMILY : a valid image family, for example, debian-11 .
IMAGE_PROJECT : the project of the image family, for example, debian-cloud .
Check the error message. You should see a denial indicating the specific
constraint violated: ERROR: (gcloud.compute.instances.create) Could not fetch resource: - Operation denied by org policy: [constraints/compute.managed.requireOsLogin]
Conditional exemptions with tags
You can use tags to grant exceptions to specific resources based on business
needs. In this example, we use a tag named osLoginOptional to identify
resources that are exempt from the OS Login requirement. When you bind this
tag with a value of true to a resource, the organization policy permits that
specific resource to exist without OS Login enabled, even while the policy
remains strictly enforced for the rest of your environment.
To grant an exception using tags, follow these steps:
Create a tag: Use the gcloud CLI to create a tag key and a tag
value.
Create the tag key:
gcloud resource-manager tags keys create osLoginOptional \
--parent = organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID
Create the tag value:
gcloud resource-manager tags values create true \
--parent = organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID /tagKeys/osLoginOptional
Replace ORGANIZATION_ID with your organization ID.
Bind the tag to a resource. To exempt a project from the
compute.managed.requireOsLogin constraint, bind the osLoginOptional=true
tag to the project using the
gcloud resource-manager tags bindings create command :
gcloud resource-manager tags bindings create \
--tag-value = ORGANIZATION_ID /osLoginOptional/true \
--parent = //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_ID \
--location = global
Replace ORGANIZATION_ID with your organization ID,
and PROJECT_ID with the ID of the project that you
want to exempt.
To learn how to bind tags to other resources, see
Bind a tag to a resource .
Update the policy: Create or update your policy YAML file (for example,
policy.yaml ) to include the conditional rule.
name : projects/ PROJECT_ID /policies/compute.managed.requireOsLogin
spec :
rules :
- condition :
expression : "resource.matchTag(' ORGANIZATION_ID /osLoginOptional', 'true')"
enforce : false
- enforce : true
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID.
ORGANIZATION_ID : your organization ID.
Apply the policy: Use the following gcloud CLI command to
activate the configuration:
gcloud org-policies set-policy policy.yaml
Migration from legacy constraints
When migrating, note that managed constraints improve upon, but don't exactly
replicate, the behavior of legacy policies. Managed constraints offer greater
predictability by checking for violations only during API requests that create
or modify resources. If a request violates a constraint, the API call fails
with a clear error. This differs from legacy policies, which could be enforced
at various stages of an operation or used as resource attributes, making
enforcement behavior less predictable.
When moving from a legacy compute.* constraint to a modern compute.managed.*
equivalent, follow these steps to prevent unintended tightening of restrictions:
Discover: Identify the new managed constraint alternative.
Analyze and validate: Use Policy Simulator and dry run as described earlier.
Enforce managed constraint: Apply the new managed constraint alongside the
legacy one.
Delete legacy policies:
Navigate to Asset Inventory in the Google Cloud console and filter by
orgpolicy.Policy and the legacy constraint name to identify all policies
that use the legacy constraint.
Delete all policies that use the legacy constraint. Deleting a policy
resets that policy to the Google-managed default behavior for that
constraint.
