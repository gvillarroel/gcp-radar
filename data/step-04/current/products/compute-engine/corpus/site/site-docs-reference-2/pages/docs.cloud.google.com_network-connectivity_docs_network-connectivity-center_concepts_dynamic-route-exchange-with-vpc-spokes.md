Route exchange with VPC spokes
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides an overview of route exchange between hybrid spokes and
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) spokes in Network Connectivity Center (NCC).
Route exchange with VPC spokes lets you connect VPC
spokes and hybrid spokes, such as Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachments,
HA VPN tunnels, and Router appliance VMs on the same hub,
which enables highly scalable any-to-any network connectivity between all such
spokes attached to a single hub. Using VPC spokes and hybrid
spokes on the same hub lets you connect multiple on-premises networks and
Google Cloud VPC networks.
Route exchange with VPC spokes support IPv4 addressing only.
Workload VPC networks
A workload VPC network is a VPC network
that a spoke administrator adds to a hub as a VPC
spoke. A workload VPC network can be a standalone
VPC network, or it can be a
Shared VPC network. A workload
VPC network can be located in either the same project as the
NCC hub or a different project in the same or another
organization.
Routing VPC networks
A routing VPC network is a VPC network
that contains at least one hybrid spoke
with Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachments,
HA VPN tunnels, or Router appliance VMs.
A routing VPC network can also be connected as
a VPC spoke
on the same hub as its hybrid spokes.
For Private Service Connect connection propagation
to work with hybrid spokes, the routing VPC network must also be
added as a VPC spoke.
Each routing VPC network—and the Cloud Interconnect
VLAN attachments, HA VPN tunnels, or Router appliance VMs
that use the routing VPC network—must be located in the same
project as the NCC hub.
Establishing connectivity between hybrid spokes and VPC spokes
You can establish connectivity between hybrid spokes and VPC spokes
by adding workload VPC networks to an NCC hub as
VPC spokes, then you add Cloud Interconnect VLAN
attachments, HA VPN tunnels, or Router appliance VMs to the
same hub as hybrid spokes. The Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachments,
HA VPN tunnels, or Router appliance VMs in each hybrid
spoke are also associated with one or more routing VPC networks ,
but the routing VPC networks themselves need not be added to the
NCC hub as VPC spokes.
To establish connectivity between hybrid spokes and VPC spokes:
Network administrators for the routing VPC networks must first
review the Cloud Router path selection and dynamic routing mode:
NCC hybrid spokes only support the Cloud Router
legacy best path selection mode. For detailed information about
Cloud Router path selection, see
Best path selection modes
in the Cloud Router documentation.
NCC hybrid spokes support both global and regional dynamic
routing modes. The dynamic routing mode of a routing VPC
network determines in which regions the NCC dynamic routes
are programmed in the VPC spokes:
If the dynamic routing mode is regional, NCC dynamic
routes from its hybrid spokes are only programmed in the same region
as each hybrid spoke.
If the dynamic routing mode is global, NCC dynamic
routes from its hybrid spokes are programmed in all regions.
The VPC spoke only uses the dynamic routing mode when
hybrid spokes reside in the same hub.
Hub administrators do the following:
Create a new NCC hub .
Give access to the NCC hub
so that spoke administrators can propose VPC spokes that
are located in projects other than the hub's project.
Spoke administrators create VPC spokes and hybrid spokes:
Create a VPC spoke proposal
to attach a workload VPC network to the hub.
Create a Router appliance spoke
Create a Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachment spoke
Create a VPN spoke
A hub administrator must review proposed VPC spokes
that are located in projects other than the hub's project.
Spoke administrators or network administrators for the routing
VPC networks must configure advertisement of subnet routes
in VPC spokes. Either of the following techniques can be
used:
A spoke administrator for the hybrid spoke can set the includeImportRanges
field to ["ALL_IPV4_RANGES"] in the hybrid spoke resource by using the
API. For more information, see the
LinkedRouterApplianceInstances ,
LinkedInterconnectAttachments ,
and
LinkedVpnTunnels types.
A spoke administrator for the hybrid spoke can update the hybrid spoke by
using the Google Cloud CLI with the
--include-import-ranges=[ ALL_IPV4_RANGES ] flag. For more information, see
the network-connectivity spokes linked-router-appliances
update ,
network-connectivity spokes linked-interconnect-attachments
update ,
and network-connectivity spokes linked-vpn-tunnels
update flags.
A network administrator for the routing VPC network can
advertise custom address ranges
on the Cloud Routers for the hybrid spokes. The custom ranges can
be a list of all subnet IPv4 address ranges of the VPC
spokes on the hub, or you can use larger CIDRs that contain the subnet
IPv4 address ranges of the VPC spokes.
Route tables
The NCC hub route table lists all learned dynamic routes from
on-premises networks and subnet routes that are reachable from the attached
spoke networks through the NCC hub. Hub route tables are
read-only resources, fully managed by NCC.
For detailed information about how to view the hub route table, see
View the hub route table and routes .
The hub route table is updated with appropriate route entries when the
following events occur:
VPC spoke creation or deletion
Subnet creation or deletion in attached VPC spokes
Hybrid spoke creation or deletion
BGP route advertisement or withdrawal from attached hybrid spokes
Each VPC spoke also has a VPC network route table.
Each VPC network route table lists all routes that are
programmed in the VPC network. For steps to view
the VPC route table, see
View the VPC route table .
Example use cases
The following examples show an NCC hub that contains both
hybrid spokes and VPC spokes.
Overlapping NCC dynamic routes
The following NCC hub has a VPC spoke and two hybrid
spokes. Both hybrid spokes connect to an on-premises network that advertises both
192.168.0.0/16 and 192.168.44.10/24 . This example shows how NCC
programs overlap dynamic routes in a VPC spoke. For simplicity,
this example considers hybrid spokes that are in the same region. The next example,
How global dynamic routing mode and MED work together ,
shows hybrid spokes in two regions.
Overlapping NCC dynamic routes (click to enlarge).
In the preceding diagram, an on-premises network uses both the 192.168.0.0/16
and 192.168.44.10/24 IP address ranges. The on-premises network connects to two
routing VPC networks using two pairs of VLAN attachments in the
us-west1 region of each routing VPC network:
The a-west hybrid spoke contains the Cloud Routers and VLAN attachments
that receive 192.168.0.0/16 . This hybrid spoke sends the 192.168.0.0/16 dynamic
routes to the hub.
The b-west hybrid spoke contains the Cloud Routers and VLAN attachments
that receive 192.168.44.10/24 . This hybrid spoke sends the 192.168.44.10/24 dynamic
routes to the hub.
The VPC spoke imports four NCC dynamic routes from the hub:
Two NCC dynamic routes for 192.168.0.0/16 , both with next hops in
the a-west hybrid spoke.
Two NCC dynamic routes for 192.168.44.10/24 , both with next hops in
the b-west hybrid spoke.
VMs and other resources in the us-west1 region of the VPC spoke use the
NCC dynamic routes as follows:
Packets whose destinations fit within 192.168.44.10/24 are sent to the VLAN attachments
in the b-west hybrid spoke.
Packets whose destinations fit within 192.168.0.0/16 , but not in 192.168.44.10/24 , are
sent to the VLAN attachments in the a-west hybrid spoke.
How global dynamic routing mode and MED work together
The following NCC hub has a VPC spoke and two hybrid
spokes. The two hybrid spokes are in a single routing VPC network.
The on-premises IP address range is 192.168.44.10/24 . This example shows
how the multi-exit discriminator (MED) value, dynamic routing mode, and
Cloud Router best path selection algorithm control the creation of dynamic
routes in both the routing VPC network and in VPC
spokes.
Route prioritization by using MED (click to enlarge).
In the preceding diagram, an on-premises network uses the 192.168.44.10/24 IP
address range. Four VLAN attachments, two in us-west1 and two in us-east1 ,
connect the on-premises network to a routing VPC network,
routing-vpc-network . BGP sessions for the two VLAN attachments in each region
are managed by Cloud Routers in the same region.
The routing VPC network is configured as follows:
The dynamic routing mode
is global.
The best path selection mode
is legacy.
The two VLAN attachments in us-west1 are added as a hybrid spoke ( west-hybrid-spoke )
on the NCC hub.
The two VLAN attachments in us-east1 are added as a hybrid spoke ( east-hybrid-spoke )
on the NCC hub.
The on-premises routers advertise the 192.168.44.10/24 IP address range:
Using MED 10 to the BGP sessions for the west-a and east-a VLAN
attachments.
Using MED 20 to the BGP sessions for the west-b and east-b VLAN
attachments.
In the routing VPC network, each region's Cloud Router
dynamic route control plane and VPC control plane work together
to create the following local dynamic routes for 192.168.44.10/24 in each region:
In the us-west1 region, two local dynamic routes have next hops in the region
and one next hop in the us-east1 region:
The dynamic route with priority 10 uses the west-a VLAN attachment
next hop.
The dynamic route with priority 20 uses the west-b VLAN attachment
next hop.
The dynamic route with priority 275 uses the east-a VLAN attachment
next hop.
The east-a next hop has the highest priority ( 10 ) in the us-east1
region, and the inter-regional cost between us-west1 and us-east1 is
265 .
In the us-central1 region, both of the local dynamic routes have next hops
in different regions:
The dynamic route with priority 243 uses the east-a VLAN attachment
next hop. The east-a next hop has the highest priority ( 10 ) in the
us-east1 region, and the inter-regional cost between us-central1 and
us-east1 is 233 .
The dynamic route with priority 248 uses the west-a VLAN attachment
next hop. The west-a next hop has the highest priority ( 10 ) in the
us-west region, and the inter-regional cost between us-central1 and
us-west1 is 238 .
In the us-east1 region, two local dynamic routes have next hops in the region
and one next hop in the us-west1 region:
The dynamic route with priority 10 uses the east-a VLAN attachment
next hop.
The dynamic route with priority 20 uses the east-b VLAN attachment
next hop.
The dynamic route with priority 275 uses the west-a VLAN attachment
next hop.
The west-a next hop has the highest priority ( 10 ) in the us-west1
region, and the inter-regional cost between us-east1 and us-west1 is
265 .
A workload VPC network, workload-vpc-network , is added to the
same NCC hub as a VPC spoke. NCC
creates NCC dynamic routes for
192.168.44.10/24 in each region of the workload VPC network to
match the local dynamic routes created in each region of the routing
VPC network. The dynamic routing mode and best path selection
mode of the workload VPC network aren't relevant because the
workload VPC network doesn't contain the Cloud Router
resources that manage the BGP sessions for the VLAN attachments.
To control the path from the workload VPC network to the
on-premises network, adjust the MED values advertised by the on-premises
network for the 192.168.44.10/24 prefix. For details about how NCC
dynamic routes interact with subnet routes and other types of dynamic routes, see
Routing order .
