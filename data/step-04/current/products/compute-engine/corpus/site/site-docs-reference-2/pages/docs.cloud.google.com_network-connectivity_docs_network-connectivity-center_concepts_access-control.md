Roles and permissions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes the Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and permissions needed
to use Network Connectivity Center (NCC).
At a high level, you need the following:
Predefined NCC permissions, which are described in
Predefined roles .
Additional permissions as follows:
To create spokes, you need permission to read the relevant spoke
resource types, as described in
Permission to create a spoke .
To work with NCC in the Google Cloud console, you need
permission to view certain Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network resources,
as described in
Permission to use NCC in the Google Cloud console .
Be aware that if you need to work with NCC in a
Shared VPC network, you must have all needed permissions in the
host project . A hub, its spokes, and all related resources must be in the
host project.
For information about how to grant permissions, see the
IAM overview .
Predefined roles
The following table describes NCC's predefined roles.

Note: To create spokes, you also need permission to read your
spoke's resource type, as described in
Permission to create a spoke .
If you plan to work in the Google Cloud console, you also need the permissions
described in
Permission to use NCC in the Google Cloud console .
Additional required permissions
Depending on what actions you need to take in NCC, you might
need the permissions described in the following sections.
Permission to create a spoke
To create a spoke, you must have permission to read the spoke's
resource type. For example:
For VPN tunnel spokes, VLAN attachment spokes, and Router appliance
spokes, you need compute.routers.get .
To create Router appliance spokes, you need compute.instances.get .
Also, before you can use a Router appliance spoke, you must set up
peering between the Cloud Router and the router appliance instance. To
establish peering, you need the
following permissions:
compute.instances.use
compute.routers.update
To create VLAN attachment spokes, you need
compute.interconnectAttachments.get .
To create VPN tunnel spokes, you need compute.vpnTunnels.get .
To create VPC spokes, you need the following permissions:
compute.networks.use
compute.networks.get
To create VPC spokes in a different project from the hub that
it is associated with, you need networkconnectivity.groups.use .
Permission to use NCC in the Google Cloud console
To use NCC in the Google Cloud console, you need
a role—such as
Compute Network Viewer
( roles/compute.networkViewer )—that includes the permissions described
in the following table. To use these permissions, you must first
create a custom role .

compute.networks.use

compute.subnetworks.list
Note: To create spokes, you also need permission to read the
resource types used by your spokes, as described in
Permission to create a spoke .
Protecting resources with VPC Service Controls
To further secure your NCC resources, use VPC Service Controls.
VPC Service Controls provides your resources with additional security
to help mitigate the risk of data exfiltration. By using VPC Service Controls,
you can place NCC resources within service perimeters.
VPC Service Controls then protects these resources from requests that originate
outside the perimeter.
To learn more about service perimeters, see the
Service perimeter configuration
page of the VPC Service Controls documentation.
