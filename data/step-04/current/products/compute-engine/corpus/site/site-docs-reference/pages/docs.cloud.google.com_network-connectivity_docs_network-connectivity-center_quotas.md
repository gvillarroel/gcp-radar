Quotas and limits

This document lists the quotas and limits that apply to
Network Connectivity Center and Router appliance.
To change a quota, see requesting additional quota .
Google Cloud uses quotas to help ensure fairness and reduce
spikes in resource use and availability. A quota restricts how much of a
Google Cloud resource your Google Cloud project can use. Quotas
apply to a range of resource types, including hardware, software, and network
components. For example, quotas can restrict the number of API calls to a
service, the number of load balancers used concurrently by your project, or the
number of projects that you can create. Quotas protect the community of
Google Cloud users by preventing the overloading of services. Quotas also
help you to manage your own Google Cloud resources.
The Cloud Quotas system does the following:
Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services
Restricts your consumption of those resources
Provides a way to
request changes to the quota value
and automate quota adjustments
In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota
allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that
you're trying to perform fails.
Quotas generally apply at the Google Cloud project
level. Your use of a resource in one project doesn't affect
your available quota in another project. Within a Google Cloud project, quotas
are shared across all applications and IP addresses.
For more information, see the
Cloud Quotas overview .
There are also system limits on NCC resources.
System limits can't be changed.
Quotas
This section lists quotas that apply to Network Connectivity Center and Router appliance.
NCC quotas
Quotas that apply to network routes for Cloud Router also apply to
routes for NCC hubs and spokes. For more information, see
Cloud Router Quotas and limits .

Router appliance quotas
Quotas that apply to network routes for Cloud Router also apply to
routes for Router appliance spokes attached to NCC hubs.
For more information, see Cloud Router
quotas .
Limits
This section lists limits that apply to Network Connectivity Center and Router appliance.
NCC limits
Network Connectivity Center enforces the following usage limits.
Item
Value
Number of VPN tunnels that can be linked to a spoke
8
Number of VLAN attachments that can be linked to a
spoke
6
Number of router appliance instances that can be linked to a
spoke

Number of active VPC spokes per hub
250
Maximum number of VPC spokes (active and inactive) per hub
1,000
Number of include or exclude export CIDR ranges per spoke
16
Router appliance limits
The following limits for Cloud Router also apply
to Router appliance:
The maximum number of Cloud Routers per combination of
VPC network and region
The maximum number of BGP peers for each Cloud Router in a given
VPC network and region
For more information, see
Cloud Router limits .
Manage quotas
Network Connectivity Center enforces quotas on resource usage for various reasons.
For example, quotas protect the community of Google Cloud users by
preventing unforeseen spikes in usage. Quotas also help users who are exploring
Google Cloud with the
free tier
to stay within their trial.
All projects start with the same quotas, which you can change by
requesting additional quota . Some quotas might increase
automatically based on your use of a product.
Permissions
To view quotas or request quota increases, Identity and Access Management (IAM) principals need one of the
following roles.
Task
Required role
Check quotas for a project
One of the following:
Project Owner ( roles/owner )
Project Editor ( roles/editor )
Quota Viewer ( roles/servicemanagement.quotaViewer )
Modify quotas, request additional quota
One of the following:
Project Owner ( roles/owner )
Project Editor ( roles/editor )
Quota Administrator ( roles/servicemanagement.quotaAdmin )
A custom role with the serviceusage.quotas.update permission
Check your quota
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Quotas page.
Go to Quotas
To search for the quota that you want to update, use the Filter table .
If you don't know the name of the quota, use the links on this page instead.
gcloud
Using the Google Cloud CLI, run the following command to
check your quotas. Replace PROJECT_ID with your own project ID.
gcloud compute project-info describe --project PROJECT_ID
To check your used quota in a region, run the following command:
gcloud compute regions describe example-region
Errors when exceeding your quota
If you exceed a quota with a gcloud command,
gcloud outputs a quota exceeded error
message and returns with the exit code 1 .
If you exceed a quota with an API request, Google Cloud returns the
following HTTP status code: 413 Request Entity Too Large .
Request additional quota
To adjust most quotas, use the Google Cloud console.
For more information, see
Request a quota adjustment .
Resource availability
Each quota represents a maximum number for a particular type of resource that you can create,
if that resource is available. It's important to note that quotas don't
guarantee resource availability. Even if you have available quota, you can't create
a new resource if it is not available.
For example, you might have sufficient quota to create a new regional, external IP address
in a given region. However, that is not possible if there are no
available external IP addresses in that region. Zonal resource
availability can also affect your ability to create a new resource.
Situations where resources are unavailable in an entire region are rare. However, resources
within a zone can be depleted from time to time, typically without impact to the service level
agreement (SLA) for the type of resource. For more information, review the relevant SLA for the
resource.
