Router appliance overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Router appliance is a Network Connectivity Center (NCC) feature that lets you use a
third-party network virtual appliance in Google Cloud. When you use this
approach, the appliance can exchange routes with Cloud Router by
using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
Using Router appliance and NCC, you can do the following:
Connect multiple VPC networks to one another. The VPC
networks can be located across different projects in the same Google Cloud organization or
different organizations.
Connect multiple VPC networks to on-premise or other cloud
provider networks.
These external networks can be reachable through any type of hybrid spoke.
This approach is known as site-to-cloud connectivity.
Use Router appliance VMs to manage connectivity between your VPC
networks.
Use a Google Cloud VPC network as an enterprise wide
area network (WAN) to connect networks that are outside of Google Cloud.
You can establish connectivity between your external sites by using any type
of hybrid spoke. This approach is known as site-to-site
connectivity .
How it works
You can configure a router appliance instance by installing
an image on a Compute Engine VM. You can use an image provided by a
supported NCC partner . You can also use a custom image, such as an image that you
created.
After the router appliance instance is installed, you configure interfaces on
the Cloud Router to establish Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering
with the router appliance instance. BGP enables the dynamic exchange of routes
between the Cloud Router and the router appliance instance. Route
exchange, in turn, permits connectivity from the site through the router
appliance instance to the VPC network. That is, the routes
propagated by the router appliance instance can be used by VMs and other
resources that have IP addresses in the same VPC network.
Cloud Router uses interfaces configured with RFC 1918 internal IP
addresses to establish BGP peering with router appliance instances.
There are no separate APIs or Google Cloud resources or permissions for
Router appliance. To work with Router appliance, you use
Compute Engine and Cloud Router resources and permissions.
Use case: Data transfer between on-premises sites
The following topology shows a VPC network and two on-premises
sites. Each on-premises site connects to Google Cloud by using a
Router appliance spoke. The two on-premises sites can use Google's network
to exchange data with each other.
Router appliance topology (click to enlarge)
On-premises Customer network A and Customer network B are each connected
through customer premises equipment (CPE) to a router appliance instance.
CPEs typically use a connectivity mechanism, such as an SD-WAN overlay tunnel
or an IPsec VPN tunnel, to establish connectivity with the
router appliance instance.
Each router appliance instance is located in the
Google Cloud region closest to its associated customer network. Both
router appliance instances are in a single VPC network.
However, the router appliance instances are in different regions. For this
reason, the VPC network has its
dynamic routing mode
set to global .
Both router appliance instances are attached as spokes to the
Network Connectivity Center (NCC) hub. Because Customer network A and Customer network B
need to send data to each other, both spokes have the site-to-site data
transfer field enabled.
You can use site-to-site data transfer only in supported locations. For
more information, see
Locations supported for data transfer .
In each region, a router appliance instance establishes Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP) peering with the appropriate Cloud Router. Each
Cloud Router receives and advertises route prefixes from the
corresponding on-premises location.
The Cloud Routers dynamically exchange all received
routes with each other. This configuration provides end-to-end dynamic route
exchange and data plane connectivity between Customer network A and
Customer network B .
Important: For Cloud Routers in different regions to
exchange routes with each other, you must enable global dynamic routing
mode in your VPC network. For more information, see
Dynamic routing .
For detailed configuration steps for a load-balanced single-site topology,
see
Create router appliance instances .
Requirements
Follow these requirements when deploying router appliance instances.
BGP configuration
The router appliance image that you install must support the BGP
routing protocol.
To enable BGP peering between a router appliance instance and a
Cloud Router, attach each router appliance instance
as a spoke to an NCC hub.
Create a Cloud Router in the same region as the
subnet
that contains the peering interface of the router appliance instance.
Manually create BGP interfaces on the router appliance instance. These
interfaces must be in the same subnet as the router appliance instance.
Manually create BGP sessions with Cloud Router from
the router appliance instance.
For VMs that have multiple network interfaces configured as part of the
router appliance instance, you can establish BGP sessions with
Cloud Routers that are in the same subnet as the VM interface.
For more information about VM interfaces, see
Multiple network interfaces overview and examples .
Availability recommendations
The standard service-level agreement (SLA) for Compute Engine VMs also
applies to the availability of router appliance instances. This
availability SLA is 99.5% for a single VM and 99.99% for VMs in multiple
zones. For more information, see the Compute Engine SLA .
For a pair of router appliance instances, each for a different on-premises
location, run at least two VMs in different zones. Each VM must
peer with a pair of redundant Cloud Router interfaces.
For more information about zones, see
Regions and zones .
Considerations
Before using Router appliance, review the following sections.
General considerations
Router appliance requires NCC to operate. That is, you
can't configure standalone router appliance instances that peer with a
Cloud Router or with other peer routers. You must configure router
appliance instances as part of a NCC spoke.
Router appliance is only supported in the Shared VPC model when
deployed in the host project. The router appliance instance must be deployed
in the host project and all the other associated resources, such as hub,
spoke, and Cloud Router.
Router appliance does not support Shared VPC when the
Router appliance VM is deployed in the service project.
Routing considerations
If multiple router appliance instances announce the same routing prefixes
with the same MED, Google Cloud uses equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing
across all the router appliance instances.
We recommend not advertising the same prefixes through a mix of different
spoke types (router appliance instances, Cloud VPN gateways,
and VLAN attachments). If the same prefixes are reachable through a mix of
spoke types, using ECMP across the mixed spoke types can lead to imbalanced
traffic across each link.
If a single Cloud Router learns a prefix with multiple next hops,
Cloud Router selects the next hops with the shortest AS path length
first, and then uses the MED to break ties. For more information, see
AS path length in the
Cloud Router documentation.
