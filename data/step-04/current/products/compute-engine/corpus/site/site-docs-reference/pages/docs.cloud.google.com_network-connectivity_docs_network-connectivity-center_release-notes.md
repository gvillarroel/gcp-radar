February 27, 2025
Feature
Producer VPC Spokes is generally available .
If you have a VPC network that consumes a service offered through private services access, you can use a Network Connectivity Center producer VPC spoke to make the service reachable by other spokes on a hub.
February 26, 2025
Issue
Private Service Connect connection propagation is asynchronous after spoke creation or deletion. When a VPC spoke is removed
from a hub, it can take some time to update propagated Private Service Connect connections. While the Private Service Connect propagation connection update is in progress, traffic from the VM within the VPC network can flow to the backend, even after the VPC spoke is added to a new hub. To avoid this issue, we recommend that before adding the spoke to another hub,
make sure that all of the propagation status entries for the VPC network in the previous hub, whether as a source spoke or a target spoke, are deleted.
Feature
Private Service Connect connection propagation is generally available .
Connection propagation through the Network Connectivity Center hub provides access to Private Service Connect endpoints from other VPC networks.
January 30, 2025
Feature
Route exchange with VPC spokes is generally available .
This feature lets you connect VPC spokes and hybrid spokes, such as Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachments, HA VPN tunnels, and Router appliance VMs on the same hub.
Note that you are billed for Advanced Data Networking (ADN) for traffic originating from Google Cloud Platform egressing through hybrid spokes.
Issue
See the following known issues for dynamic route exchange:
Routing VPC networks that are also VPC spokes : A routing VPC network should typically contain hybrid spokes. However, if you do configure a routing VPC network as a VPC spoke, the following limitations apply:
A routing VPC network can also be a VPC spoke only if there are no other routing VPC networks on the hub. A hub supports two or more routing VPC networks only when none of the routing VPC networks are VPC spokes.
The site-to-site data transfer setting is not honored for hybrid spokes in a routing VPC network that is also a VPC spoke.
Dynamic route interaction rules : Within a routing VPC network, for each unique dynamic route destination with a next hop in a hybrid spoke, you must ensure that all other dynamic routes, regardless of priority, whose destinations exactly match or fit within the unique dynamic route destination, have next hop Cloud VPN tunnels or VLAN attachments also in a hybrid spoke. Further, you must ensure that those hybrid spokes use the same site-to-site data transfer setting (either enabled or disabled).
If only some next hops for dynamic routes with a common destination are in hybrid spokes, Network Connectivity Center can't reliably exchange dynamic routes that use that destination with VPC spokes on the hub. Consequently, VPC spokes might not receive those dynamic routes.
Network Connectivity Center doesn't perform ECMP among all next hops of hybrid spoke dynamic routes if some hybrid spokes have site-to-site data transfer enabled but other hybrid spokes have site-to-site data transfer disabled. If dynamic routes with a common destination are in hybrid spokes without matching site-to-site data transfer settings, next hops for site-to-site data transfer or for connectivity between VPC spokes and on-premises networks might not be what you expect.
Dynamic route and static route interaction rules : Within a routing VPC network, for each unique dynamic route destination that has a next hop in a hybrid spoke, you must ensure that no local static routes exist, regardless of priority, whose destinations exactly match or fit within the dynamic route destination.
If a local static route in the routing VPC network has the same destination as a hybrid spoke dynamic route, VPC spokes might lose connectivity to the dynamic route destination.
If a local static route in a routing VPC network has a destination that fits within the destination of a hybrid spoke dynamic route, VPC spokes lose connectivity to the static route destination.

October 03, 2024
Feature
Producer VPC Spokes is now available in public preview .
If you have a VPC network that consumes a service offered through private services access, you can use a Network Connectivity Center producer VPC spoke to make the service reachable by other spokes on a hub.
August 30, 2024
Feature

November 08, 2023
Announcement
Connecting VPC networks by using Network Connectivity Center is now generally available .
This feature lets you connect two or more VPC networks, represented as spokes, to a hub in the same or a different project for full mesh connectivity.
September 19, 2023
Fixed
The issue that you cannot get the status of a long-running operation for a spoke without the networkconnectivity.operations.get IAM permission in the spoke project is now resolved.
The new API and gcloud commands are documented on the Review proposed VPC spokes page. The previous API methods and gcloud commands are now deprecated.
August 08, 2023
Issue
The AcceptSpoke and RejectSpoke API methods and the network-connectivity spokes accept and network-connectivity spokes reject CLI commands have the following usability issue:
As the user, if you do not have the networkconnectivity.operations.get IAM permission in a spoke project, you cannot get the status of a long-running operation for that spoke.
The issue is being worked on. The workaround is that the spoke administrator can grant the required permissions to the appropriate hub administrator. For information about granting permissions, see Give access .

Connecting VPC networks by using Network Connectivity Center is now available in Preview .
This feature lets you connect two or more VPC networks, represented as spokes, to a hub in the same or a different project for full mesh connectivity.
May 31, 2023
Feature
Cross-Cloud Interconnect is now
generally available . You can use a Cross-Cloud Interconnect connection to peer your Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network with your network that's hosted by a supported cloud service provider. You can also use Cross-Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachments as part of a site-to-site data transfer strategy.
For example, after you configure a VLAN attachment for your Cross-Cloud Interconnect connection, you can create a Network Connectivity Center spoke to represent the attachment. If the spoke has site-to-site data transfer enabled, you can then transfer data between your remote cloud network and your other external sites. Other external sites can include your on-premises network or your network in other clouds.
For information about the cloud service providers that Cross-Cloud Interconnect supports, see the Cross-Cloud Interconnect overview . For information about site-to-site data transfer, see the Site-to-site data transfer overview .
Site-to-site data transfer is supported only in certain locations .

Feature
Networking Connectivity Center now supports the use of a third-party network virtual appliance in any Google Cloud region for the following use cases:
Providing site-to-cloud connectivity
Providing connectivity or managing traffic between VPC networks
A third-party network virtual appliance could be an SD-WAN router, a firewall appliance, a load balancer, or another appliance, as long as it uses BGP. After you create a Network Connectivity Center spoke to represent your router appliance instance, it can exchange routes dynamically with Cloud Router.
