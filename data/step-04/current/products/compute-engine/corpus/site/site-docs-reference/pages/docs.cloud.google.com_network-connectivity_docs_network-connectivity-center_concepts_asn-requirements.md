ASN requirements for site-to-site data transfer
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
If you are using Network Connectivity Center (NCC) for site-to-site data transfer, use
the following best practices for managing autonomous system numbers (ASNs).
ASN assignment
Assign ASNs as described in the following sections.
High availability pairs
High availability (HA) pairs constitute one of the following:
For Cloud Interconnect connections, you provision two attachments to
different Edge Availability Domains (EADs). Each EAD equals one shard.
For HA VPN, you have two interfaces on the same VPN gateway,
where interface 0 and interface 1 constitute the two shards.
For Router appliance, you have a pair of redundant interfaces connected
to the same router appliances.
In each of these cases, the peers need to go to the same place and offer
redundant connectivity for each other.
Cloud Router ASNs
All Cloud Routers in hybrid spokes that are associated with a single hub must use the same Cloud Router ASN:
You must configure a Cloud Router to use ASN 16550 if the
Cloud Router manages Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) sessions for
Partner Interconnect VLAN attachments.
You must configure a Cloud Router to use a private ASN as defined
in RFC 6996 if the
Cloud Router manages BGP sessions for Dedicated Interconnect
VLAN attachments, HA VPN tunnels, or Router appliances.
Both HA shards in each region going to each
peer must use the same Cloud Router ASN. Also, both shards must
always be present. Violating this can still work, but such a configuration
doesn't qualify for SLA.
You can mix Partner Interconnect (ASN 16550) and other connection
types as long as there are correctly configured HA pairs for each, as
mentioned in the previous bullet point.
You can use different Cloud Router ASNs in different regions.
Consequently, in addition to the peer ASN requirements:
You can connect any combination of hybrid spokes for
Dedicated Interconnect VLAN attachments, HA VPN
tunnels, or Router appliances to the same hub, as long as the
Cloud Routers that manage the corresponding BGP sessions are
configured with the same ASN.
A hybrid spoke for a Partner Interconnect VLAN attachment can only be
connected to a hub with other Partner Interconnect VLAN attachment
hybrid spokes.
For additional information, see Create a Cloud Router to connect a
VPC network to a peer
network .
Peer ASNs
All non-Google peering routers that are associated with a single spoke must use
the same ASN when advertising prefixes to the Cloud Router. This is important
because, if two peers advertise the same prefix with different ASNs or AS paths,
only one peer's ASN and AS path is readvertised for that prefix.
Different spokes must have different ASNs. That is, if two BGP sessions belong to
different spokes, they must have different ASNs.
Example
Suppose that your NCC setup uses the following spokes:
Spoke A-east includes VPN tunnels 1 and 2 . It uses Cloud Router
A .
Spoke B-west includes VPN tunnels 3 and 4 . It uses Cloud Router
B .
Because all spokes connect to the same hub, Cloud Router A and
Cloud Router B must both use the same
number—for example, 65000 —in the bpg.asn field.
In this same scenario, your setup includes the following on-premises routers:
Peer router A1-east is associated with spoke A-east and
Cloud Router A .
Peer router A2-east is also associated with spoke A-east and
Cloud Router A .
Peer router B1-west is associated with spoke B-west and Cloud Router
B .
Peer router B2-west is also associated with spoke B-west and
Cloud Router B .
Because peer router A1-east and peer router A2-east are associated with one
spoke (spoke A-east ), they must use the same ASN—for example, 65001 .
Cloud Router A also uses this number, in the bgpPeers.peerAsn field for
VPN tunnel 1 and the bgpPeers.peerAsn field for VPN tunnel 2 .
Similarly, peer router B1-west and peer router B2-west are both associated
with one spoke (spoke B-west ), so they must use the same
ASN—for example, 65002 . Cloud Router B also uses this number, in
the bgpPeers.peerAsn field for VPN tunnel 3 and in the bgpPeers.peerAsn
field for VPN tunnel 4 .
AS path loop detection
We recommend configuring autonomous system (AS) path loop detection on your peer
routers. This feature is almost always on by default, but if it is not, we
recommend that you configure it. When AS path loop detection is enabled, if two
spokes are configured with the same peer ASN, AS path loop detection on a peer
router for one spoke drops all prefix advertisements from the other spoke.
