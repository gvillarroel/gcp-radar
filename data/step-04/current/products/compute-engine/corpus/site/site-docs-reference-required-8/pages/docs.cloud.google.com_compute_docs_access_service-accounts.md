This page describes how service accounts work with Compute Engine.
For step-by-step information about attaching a service account to a
virtual machine (VM) instance, review one of the following documents:
To set up service account during VM creation, see
Create a VM that uses a user-managed service account .
To set up service account on an existing VM, see
Change the attached service account .
To learn about best practices for creating and managing service accounts, read
the
Best practices for working with service accounts
documentation.
Try it for yourself
If you're new to Google Cloud, create an account to evaluate how
Compute Engine performs in real-world
scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and
deploy workloads.

What is a service account?
A service account is a special kind of account
used by an application or compute workload, rather than a person. Service
accounts are managed by Identity and Access Management (IAM) .
Keep the following in mind when using service accounts with your VMs:
You can attach the same service account to multiple VMs, but a single VM
can only have one service account attached to it.
If you attach the same service account to multiple VMs, any subsequent
changes you make to the service account affects all VMs that use the service
account. This includes any changes you make to the
IAM roles granted to the service account.
For example, if you remove a role, all
VMs using the service account lose the permissions granted by that role.
How Compute Engine uses service accounts
Compute Engine uses two types of service accounts:
User-managed service accounts
Service agents
A user-managed service account can be attached to a Compute Engine
instance to provide credentials to applications running on the instance. These
credentials are used by the application for authentication to Google Cloud
APIs, and authorization to access Google Cloud resources. Only
user-managed service accounts can be attached to an instance, and an instance
can have only one attached service account. You can change the service account
that is attached to an instance at creation time or later on.
Service agents are used by the instance to access internal processes on your
behalf.
In addition, you can create firewall rules that allow or
deny traffic to and from instances based on the service account that you
associate with each instance.
How authorization is determined
The authorization provided to applications hosted on a Compute Engine
instance is limited by two separate configurations: the
roles granted to the attached service account , and the
access scopes that you set on the instance. Both of these
configurations must allow access before the application running on the instance
can access a resource.
Suppose you have an app that reads and writes files on Cloud Storage, it must
first authenticate to the Cloud Storage API. You can create an instance with the
cloud-platform scope and attach a service account to the instance. You can
then grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to the service account to give your
app access to the appropriate resources. Your app uses the service account
credentials to authenticate to the Cloud Storage API without embedding any
secret keys or user credentials in your instance, image, or app code. Your app
also uses the authorization provided by the IAM roles on the
service account to access resources.
For more information about authorization, see Authorization
on this page.
User-managed service accounts
User-managed service accounts include new service accounts that you explicitly
create and the Compute Engine default service account.
New service accounts
You can create and manage your own service accounts using
IAM . After you create an account, you grant the account
IAM roles and set up instances to run as the service account.
Apps running on instances with the service account attached can use the
account's credentials to make requests to other Google APIs.
To create and set up a new service account, see
Create a VM that uses a user-managed service account .
Compute Engine default service account
New projects that have
enabled the
Compute Engine API have a Compute Engine default service
account, which has the following email:
PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
The Compute Engine default service account has the following
attributes:
Automatically created, with an autogenerated name and email address, and added
to your project when you enable the Compute Engine API. You have
full control over the account.
Attached by default to all VMs that you created by using the Google Cloud CLI
or the Google Cloud console. You can override this behavior by specifying
a different service account when you create the VM, or by explicitly
specifying that no service account be attached to the VM.
Depending on your organization policy configuration, the default service account might
automatically be granted the Editor role on your
project. We strongly recommend that you disable the automatic role grant by
enforcing the iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts organization policy
constraint . If you created your organization after May 3, 2024, this
constraint is enforced by default.
If you disable the automatic role grant, you must decide which roles to grant to the default
service accounts, and then grant these
roles yourself.
If the default service account already has the Editor role, we recommend that you replace the
Editor role with less permissive roles.To safely modify the service account's roles, use Policy Simulator to see the impact of
the change, and then grant and revoke the
appropriate roles .
You can disable or delete this service account from your project, but doing so
might cause any applications that depend on the service account's credentials to
fail. If you accidentally delete the Compute Engine default service
account, you can try to recover the account within 30 days. For more
information, see Delete and undelete service accounts .
If the Compute Engine default service account was deleted more than
30 days ago, you can try to recover the service account by following the process
in Troubleshooting default service accounts .
Service agents
Service agents are created
and managed by Google Cloud and assigned to your project automatically. These
accounts represent different Google Cloud services, and each account
typically has some level of access to your Google Cloud resources.
You cannot attach service agents to a Compute Engine instance.
Google APIs Service Agent
Apart from the default service account, all projects enabled with
Compute Engine come with a Google APIs Service Agent ,
identifiable using the email:
PROJECT_NUMBER @cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com
This service agent is designed specifically to run internal Google
processes on your behalf. This service agent is owned by Google and is not listed in
the Service Accounts section of Google Cloud console. By default, this
service agent is automatically granted the project editor role on the project and is
listed in the IAM section of Google Cloud console.
This service agent is deleted only when the project is deleted. However, you
can change the roles granted to this account, including revoking all access to
your project.
Certain resources rely on the default editor permissions granted to this service agent.
For example, managed instance groups and autoscaling uses the credentials of this
service agent to create, delete, and manage instances. If you revoke permissions
to this service agent, or modify the permissions in such a way that it doesn't
grant permissions to create instances, this will cause managed instance groups
and autoscaling to stop working.
For these reasons, you should not modify this service agent's roles unless a
role recommendation explicitly suggests that
you modify them.
Compute Engine Service Agent
All projects that have enabled the
Compute Engine API have a Compute Engine Service
Agent , which has the following email:
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @compute-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com
This service agent is designed specifically for
Compute Engine to perform its service duties on your project.
It relies on the Service Agent IAM Policy granted on your
Google Cloud Project. It is also the service agent
Compute Engine uses to
access the user-managed service account on VM
instances. Google owns this account, but it is specific to your project.
This service agent is hidden from the
IAM page in the
console unless you select Include Google-provided role grants .
By default, this service agent is automatically granted the
compute.serviceAgent role on your project.
This service agent is deleted only when you delete your project. You
can change the roles granted to this service agent and revoke all access
to your project from this agent. Revoking or changing the permissions for
this service agent prevents Compute Engine from accessing the
identities of your service accounts on your VMs, and can cause outages of
software running inside your VMs.
For these reasons, you should avoid modifying the roles for this service agent
as much as possible.
Attaching a service account to an instance
To avoid providing an application with excess permissions, we recommend that you
create a user-managed service account, grant it only the roles your application
needs to function properly, and attach it to your Compute Engine
instance. Your code can then use
Application Default Credentials
to authenticate with the credentials provided by the service account.
You can attach a service account to a Compute Engine instance when
you create the instance, or later. Only one service account can be attached
to an instance at a time; if you attach a service account to an instance that
already has a service account attached, the previous service account is no
longer used by that instance.
When you attach a service account to a Compute Engine instance, you must
also ensure that the scopes set on the instance are correct. Otherwise, your app
might not be able to access all of the APIs it needs. For more information, see
Access scopes on this page.
For step-by-step information about attaching a service account to a
Compute Engine instance, review one of the following documents:
Create a VM that uses a user-managed service account
Change the attached service account
Authorization
When you set up an instance to run as a service account, you determine the level
of access the service account has by the IAM roles that you
grant to the service account .
If the service account has no IAM roles, then no resources can
be accessed using the service account on that instance.
Furthermore, an instance's access scopes determine the default OAuth scopes for
requests made through the gcloud CLI and client libraries on the
instance. As a result, access scopes potentially further limit access to API
methods when authenticating through OAuth. However, they don't extend to other
authentication protocols like gRPC.
The best practice is to set the full cloud-platform access scope on the
instance, then control the service account's access using IAM
roles.
Essentially:
IAM restricts access to APIs based on the IAM
roles that are granted to the service account.
Access scopes potentially further limit access to API methods.
Both access scopes and IAM roles are described in detail in the
following sections.
IAM roles
You must
grant the appropriate IAM roles to a service account
to allow that service account access to relevant API methods.
For example, you can grant a service account the IAM roles for
managing Cloud Storage objects, or for managing Cloud Storage
buckets, or both, which limits the account to the permissions granted by those
roles.
When you grant an IAM role to a service account, any application
running on an instance that has that service account attached will have the
authorization conferred by that role.
Some things to keep in mind:
Some IAM roles are in Beta.
If there isn't a predefined role for the access level you want, you can
create and grant custom roles .
You must set access scopes on the instance to authorize access.
While a service account's access level is determined by the roles
granted to the service account, an instance's access scopes determine the
default OAuth scopes for requests made through the gcloud CLI
and client libraries on the instance. As a result, access scopes potentially
further limit access to API methods when authenticating through OAuth.
Access scopes
Access scopes are the legacy method of specifying authorization for your
VM instance. They define the default OAuth scopes used in requests from the
gcloud CLI or the client libraries. Access scopes don't apply
for calls made using gRPC.
Access scopes apply on a per-VM basis and persists only for the life of the VM.
You can set access scopes when creating a VM or
update the access scope
on an existing VM.
Generally, the documentation for each API method lists the scopes
required for that method. For example, the instances.insert method provides a
list of valid scopes in its
authorization
section.
Access scopes have no effect if you have not enabled the related API on the
project that the service account belongs to. For example, granting an access
scope for Cloud Storage on a virtual machine instance allows the
instance to call the Cloud Storage API only if you have enabled the
Cloud Storage API on the project.
Default scopes
When you create a new Compute Engine instance, it is automatically
configured with the following access scopes:
Read-only access to Cloud Storage:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only
Write access to write Compute Engine logs:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write
Write access to publish metric data to your Google Cloud projects:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.write
Read-only access to Service Management features required for Google Cloud
Endpoints (Alpha) :
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management.readonly
Read or write access to Service Control features required for Google Cloud
Endpoints (Alpha) :
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol
Write access to Cloud Trace allows an application running on a
VM to write trace data to a project.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append
Scopes best practice
There are many
access scopes
available to choose from, but a best practice is to set the cloud-platform
access scope, which is an OAuth scope for Google Cloud services, and then
control the service account's access by granting it IAM roles.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
Scopes examples
Following the scopes best practice, if you enabled the cloud-platform access
scope on an instance and then granted the following
predefined IAM roles :
roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1
roles/storage.objectViewer
roles/compute.networkAdmin
Then the service account has only the permissions included in those three roles.
Applications impersonating that service account cannot perform actions outside
of these roles despite the Google Cloud access scope.
On the other hand, if you grant a more restrictive scope on the instance, like
the Cloud Storage read-only scope
( https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only ), and
set the roles/storage.objectAdmin administrator role on the service
account, then by default, requests from the gcloud CLI and the
client libraries wouldn't be able to manage Cloud Storage objects from
that instance, even though you granted the service account the
roles/storage.ObjectAdmin role. This is because the Cloud Storage
read-only scope does not authorize the instance to manipulate
Cloud Storage data.
Example access scopes include the following:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform . View and manage your data
across Google Cloud services in the specified
Google Cloud project.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute . Full control access to
Compute Engine methods.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute.readonly . Read-only access to
Compute Engine methods.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only . Read-only access to
Cloud Storage.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write . Write access to the
Compute Engine logs.
