Access control overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
By default, all Google Cloud projects come with a single user: the
original project creator. No other users have access to the project, and
therefore, access to Compute Engine resources, until a user is added
as a project member or is bound to a specific resource. This page describes the
ways you can add new users to your project and how to set access
control for your Compute Engine resources using
Identity and Access Management (IAM).
For information about providing access to applications running on your
Compute Engine instances, see
How authorization is determined .
Access control options for users
To give users the ability to create and manage your Compute Engine
resources, you can add users as team members to your project or to
specific
resources and grant them permissions using IAM roles .
A team member can be an individual user with a valid Google Account or user account from an external identity provider , a Google
Group, a group of identities from a workforce identity pool, a service account, or a Google Workspace domain. When you add a
team member to a project or to a resource, you specify which roles to grant
them. IAM provides three types of roles:
predefined roles ,
basic roles , and
custom roles .
Resources inherit the policies of their parent resources in the
Google Cloud
resource hierarchy . The effective
policy for a resource is the union of the policy set at that resource and the
policy inherited from its parent.
Note: To give a user SSH access to VM instances and prevent access to all APIs,
add the user's SSH keys to
the project or instance instead of adding the user to the project and granting
them wide ranging permissions.
Predefined Compute Engine roles
Predefined roles grant a set of related permissions. Compute Engine
offers the following predefined roles:
Role title
Capabilities
Target user
Compute Engine image user
Permission to list and use images from another project. Grant a member this
role together with another role so the member can use images from another
project to create a new resource. For example, grant this role and the Instance
Admin role so that a member can use images from another project to create VM
instances and persistent disks.
If you are creating
managed instance groups
or if you are using Deployment Manager to
create VM instances, you might need to grant the project's Google APIs service
account this role before you can use images from other projects.
Service accounts
Systems administrators
Developers
Compute Engine instance admin (v1)
Full control of Compute Engine instances, instance groups, disks,
snapshots, and images. Read-only access to all Compute Engine
networking resources.
If the member is managing VM instances that are configured to
run as a service account, you must also grant the
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser role so
that they can assign service accounts to VM instances.
Systems administrators
Developers
Compute Engine admin role
Full control of all Compute Engine resources. If the user is
managing VM instances that are configured to run as a service
account, you must also grant the roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
role.
Systems administrators
Developers
Compute Engine network admin
Permissions to create, modify, and delete networking resources, except for
firewall rules and SSL certificates. The network admin role allows read-only
access to firewall rules, SSL certificates, and instances (to view their
ephemeral IP addresses). The network admin role does not allow a member to
create, start, stop, or delete instances.
Network administrators
Compute Engine security admin
Permissions to create, modify, and delete firewall rules and
SSL certificates.
Security administrators
Compute Engine load balancer admin beta
Permissions to create, modify, and delete load balancers and associated
resources.
Load balancer administrators
Compute Engine service account user
Permission to create instances that use service accounts, and permission to
attach a disk and set metadata on an instance already configured to run as a
service account.
You should not grant this role by itself because it provides
no permissions to the Compute Engine API. You should grant a member
this role and another role, such as the instance admin role.
Systems administrators
Developers
Compute Engine viewer role
Read-only access to get and list Compute Engine resources,
without being able to read the data stored on them. For example, an account with
this role could inventory all of the disks in a project, but it could not read
any of the data on those disks.
System administrators
Compute Engine network user
Permissions to use a shared VPC
network. Specifically, grant this role to service owners who need to use
resources in the host project. Once granted, service owners can use subnetworks
and networks that belong to the host project. For example, a network user
can create a VM instance that belongs to a shared VPC host network, but they
cannot delete or create new networks in the host project.
Systems administrators
Developers
Compute Engine network viewer
Read-only access to all networking resources. For example, if you have
software that inspects your network configuration, you could grant that
software's service account the network viewer role.
Network administrators
Systems administrators
Developers
Service accounts
Compute Engine storage admin beta
Permissions to create, modify, and delete disks, images, and snapshots.
For example, if your company has someone who manages images and you do not
want them to have the editor role on the project, then grant their account this
role.
Systems administrators
Developers
Compute Engine shared VPC admin
Permissions to administer shared VPC host projects,
specifically enabling the host projects and associating service projects to
the host project's network. This role can only be granted at the organization
level.

To see a list of API methods that a specific role grants permission to, review
the Compute Engine IAM roles
documentation.
Basic IAM roles
Basic IAM roles map directly to the legacy project owner, editor,
and viewer roles. Generally, you should use predefined roles whenever possible;
however, in some cases, where IAM is not yet supported, you might
need to use a basic role to grant the correct permissions.
Role title
Permissions
Owner
All viewer and editor privileges, plus the ability to change billing
settings, manage access control, and delete a project.
Editor
All viewer privileges, plus the ability to create, modify, and delete
resources.
Viewer
Read-only permissions to all resources; no permission to change resources.
To learn more about basic roles, read documentation for
basic roles .
If predefined or basic roles do not meet you needs, you can create custom
roles .
IAM policies for Compute Engine resources
You can
grant access to
Compute Engine resources
such as VM instances, images, and disks, by attaching IAM
policies directly to those resources. An IAM policy lets you
manage IAM roles on those resources
instead of, or in addition to, managing roles at the project level. This gives
you flexibility to apply the principle of least privilege, which is to grant
access only to the specific resources that collaborators need to do their work.
With IAM policies for Compute Engine resources,
organizations can:
Grant users access to a specific subset of resources . Suppose Alice should
manage a subset of instances in a project. With instance-level
IAM policies, you grant her the
compute.instanceAdmin.v1
role on only those instances. If you granted Alice the same role on the
project, then she would have permission to modify all instances in the
project.
Allow administrators to grant access . Administrators can grant other
people access to instances, disks, and images without needing to be powerful
project owners. Suppose Bob is a developer who has been granted the
compute.storageAdmin role on
a specific image. He can share that image with his teammates by granting them
the compute.imageUser role on
the image. Without IAM policies for Compute Engine
resources, Bob can't share that image with his teammates unless he becomes a
project owner because he'd need to modify the project's IAM
policy.
Resources also inherit the policies of their parent resources. If you set a
policy at the project level, it's inherited by all its child resources. The
effective policy for a resource is the union of the policy set at that resource
and the policy inherited from higher up in the hierarchy. For more information,
read about the
IAM policy hierarchy .
Organization policies
If you are a Google Workspace member, your project might be part of an
Organization resource .
An Organization resource is the supernode in the Google Cloud
resource hierarchy
that is closely associated with a Google Workspace account. After an
Organization resource is created for a Google Workspace domain, all
Google Cloud projects created by members of the domain belong to the
Organization resource.
An organization can implement
organization policies ,
which are policies that restrict allowed configurations across your entire
Google Cloud resource hierarchy. For Compute Engine, you can
implement the following policies:
Disable interactive access to the serial console .
Disable external IP addresses for VM instances .
Restrict which image projects are available to your project members
To set Organization policies ,
you must have been granted the orgpolicy.policyAdmin role on the organization.
You can also set project-specific overrides in case you have exceptions to the
policy.
To learn more about Organizations, read the
Organizations
documentation.
To learn more about Organization policies, read the
Organization policy
documentation.
Granting users SSH access to VM instances
To give a user the ability to connect to a VM instance using SSH without
granting them the ability to manage Compute Engine resources,
add the user's public key
to the project, or add a user's public key to a specific instance. Using this
method, you can avoid adding a user as a project member, while still granting
them access to specific instances.
To learn more about SSH and managing SSH keys, read the
SSH keys overview .
Note that if you grant the roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1 role to a project
member, they can automatically connect to instances using SSH, as long as the
instance is not set up to run as a service account. If the instance is set up
to run as a service account, you must also grant the
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser role before the member can connect to the
instance.
If you add a member as a project owner or editor, they also automatically have
SSH access to VM instances in the project.
Access control for apps running on VM instances
If you run app code on instances and the app needs to
authenticate to other Google Cloud APIs, you can create service
accounts and give these service accounts specific IAM roles to
authenticate to other Google Cloud APIs on your behalf. A service account
is a special account that has no user credentials and is ideal for
server-to-server interactions.
To learn more about service accounts, read the
Service accounts documentation.
Managed workload identities for Compute Engine workloads
You can set up automatic provisioning and lifecycle management of
X.509 certificates from Certificate Authority Service
(CA Service) using managed workload identities. Managed workload
identity certificates are issued from CA Service, which is a
highly-available, scalable Google Cloud service that helps you to simplify and
automate the deployment, management, and
security of CA services while staying in control of your private keys.
With managed workload identities, you can benefit from per-VM
mTLS ,
managed by Compute Engine. Per-VM mTLS uses X.509 certificates that are
issued when you create a VM. These mTLS certificates are automatically rotated,
so you don't need to worry about managing the certificates.
Managed workload identities provide a foundation to enable mutually
authenticated and encrypted communications between any two Compute Engine VMs.
For example, when you use managed workload identities, service A running in one
VM communicates with service B running in a different VM over an encrypted
channel that is established using mTLS.
For information about configuring managed workload identities, see
Authenticate workloads to other workloads over mTLS .
