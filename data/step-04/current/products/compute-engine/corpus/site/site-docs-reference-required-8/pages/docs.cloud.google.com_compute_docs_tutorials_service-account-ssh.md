Configure apps to use SSH
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes how to configure apps to programmatically connect
between two virtual machine (VM) instances using SSH and OS Login. Enabling apps
to use SSH can be useful for automating system management processes.
All code samples used in this guide is hosted on the
GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples GitHub page .
Before you begin
Set up SSH for a service account .
Set up OS Login on your
project, or on a VM that runs as a service account.
If you haven't already, set up authentication .
Authentication verifies your identity for access to Google Cloud services and APIs. To run
code or samples from a local development environment, you can authenticate to
Compute Engine by selecting one of the following options:
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Console
When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
gcloud
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
After installation,
initialize the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
Set a default region and zone .
Set up an SSH app
Set up your app to manage SSH keys and initiate SSH connections to
Compute Engine VMs. At a high level, your app should do the following:
Import the
Google OS Login library to
build client libraries, which enables you to authenticate with the OS Login
API.
Initialize the OS Login Client object to enable your app to use OS Login.
Implement a create_ssh_key() method that generates an SSH key for the VM's
service account and adds the public key to the service account.
Call the
get_login_profile() method
from the OS Login library to get the POSIX user name that the service account
uses.
Implement a run_ssh() method to execute a remote SSH command.
Remove the temporary SSH key files.
Sample SSH app
The oslogin_service_account_ssh.py sample app demonstrates a possible implementation
of an SSH app. In this example, the app uses the run_ssh() method to
execute a command on a remote instance and return the command output.
"""
Example of using the OS Login API to apply public SSH keys for a service
account, and use that service account to run commands on a remote
instance over SSH. This example uses zonal DNS names to address instances
on the same internal VPC network.

Run the SSH app
After you create an app that uses SSH, you can run the app by following a
process similar to the following example, which installs and runs the
oslogin_service_account_ssh.py sample app. The libraries you install may differ,
depending on the programming language the app uses.
Alternatively, you can write an app that imports oslogin_service_account_ssh.py and
runs it directly.
Connect to the VM that
hosts the SSH app.
On the VM, install pip and the Python 3 client library:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip -y && pip install --upgrade google-cloud-os-login requests
Optional: If you are using the oslogin_service_account_ssh.py sample app, download
it from
GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples :
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/master/compute/oslogin/oslogin_service_account_ssh.py
Run the SSH app. The sample app uses argparse to accept variables from the
command line. In this example, instruct the app to install and run cowsay
on another VM in your project.
python3 service_account_ssh.py \
--cmd 'sudo apt install cowsay -y && cowsay "It works!"' \
--project= PROJECT_ID --instance= VM_NAME --zone= ZONE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the VM that the app
is connecting to.
VM_NAME : the name of the VM that the app is
connecting to.
ZONE : the zone of the VM that the app is connecting
to.
The output is similar to the following:
⋮

It works!
