Compute Engine IAM roles and permissions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
When you add a new member to your project, you can use an
Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to give that member one or
more IAM roles. Each IAM role contains permissions
that grant the member access to specific resources.
Compute Engine has a set of
predefined IAM roles that are described on
this page. You can also create custom roles
that contain subsets of permissions that map directly to your needs.
To learn which permissions are required for each method, see the
Compute Engine API reference documentation:
Compute Engine v1 API reference
Compute Engine beta API reference
For information about granting access, see the following pages.
To set IAM policies at a project level, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations
in the IAM documentation.
To set policies on specific Compute Engine resources, read
Granting access to Compute Engine resources .
To assign roles to a Compute Engine service account, read
Create a VM that uses a user-managed service account .
What is IAM?
Google Cloud offers
IAM ,
which lets you give more granular access to specific
Google Cloud resources and prevents unwanted access to other resources.
IAM lets you adopt the
security principle of least privilege ,
so you grant only the necessary access to your resources.
IAM lets you control who (identity) has
what (roles) permission to which resources by setting
IAM policies. IAM policies grant specific roles
to a project member, giving that identity certain permissions. For example, for
a given resource, such as a project, you can assign the
Compute Network Admin role ( roles/compute.networkAdmin )
to a user account (a Google Account or an account from an
external identity provider )
and that account can control network-related resources in the project, but
cannot manage other resources, like instances and disks. You can also use
IAM to manage the
Google Cloud console legacy roles
granted to project team members.
The serviceAccountUser role
When granted together with the
Compute Instance Admin (v1) role
( roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1 ) ,
the Service Account User role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) gives members the ability to create
and manage instances that use a service account. Specifically,
granting roles/iam.serviceAccountUser and roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1
together gives members permission to do the following:
Create an instance that runs as a
service account .
Attach a persistent disk to an instance that runs as a service account.
Set instance metadata on an instance that runs as a service account.
Use SSH to connect to an instance that runs as a service account.
Reconfigure an instance to run as a service account.
You can grant the Service Account User role ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) in
one of two ways:
Recommended . Grant the role to a member on a
specific service account .
This gives a member access to the service account for which they are an
iam.serviceAccountUser but prevents access to other service accounts for
which the member is not an iam.serviceAccountUser .
Grant the role to a member on the
project level . The member has access to all
service accounts in the project, including service accounts that are created
in the future.
If you aren't familiar with service accounts,
learn more about service accounts .
Google Cloud console permission
To use the Google Cloud console to access Compute Engine resources, you
must have a role that contains the following permission on the project:
compute.projects.get
Connecting to an instance as an instanceAdmin
After you grant a project member the roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1 role, they
can connect to virtual machine (VM) instances by using standard Google Cloud
tools, like the gcloud CLI or
SSH-in-browser .
When a member uses the gcloud CLI or SSH-in-browser, the
tools automatically generate a public/private key pair and add the public
key to the project metadata. If the member does not have permissions to edit
project metadata, the tool adds the member's public key to the instance
metadata instead.
If the member has an existing key pair they want to use, they
can manually add their public key to the instance's metadata.
Learn more about adding SSH keys to an instance .
IAM with service accounts
Create new custom service accounts and grant IAM roles to service
accounts to limit the access of your instances. Use IAM roles
with custom service accounts to:
Limit the access your instances have to Google Cloud APIs using granular
IAM roles.
Give each instance, or set of instances, a unique identity.
Limit the access of your default service account.
Learn more about service accounts .
Managed instance groups and IAM
Managed instance groups (MIGs) are resources
that perform actions on your behalf without direct user interaction. For
example, the MIG can add and remove VMs from the group.
All of the operations performed by Compute Engine as part of the MIG are
performed by the
Google APIs Service Agent
for your project, which has an email address like the following:
PROJECT_ID @cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com
By default, the Google APIs Service Agent is granted the Instance Group Manager
Service Agent role ( roles/compute.instanceGroupManagerServiceAgent ) at the
project level, which gives enough privileges to create resources based on the
MIG's configuration. If you're customizing access for the Google APIs Service
Agent, then grant the Compute Instance Admin (v1) role
( roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1 ) and, optionally, the Service Account User
role ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ). The Service Account User role is required
only if the MIG creates VMs that can run as a service account.
Note that the Google APIs Service Agent is also used by other processes,
including Deployment Manager .
When you create a MIG or update its instance template, Compute Engine
validates that the Google APIs Service Agent has the following role and
permissions:
Service Account User role, which is important if you plan to create instances
that can run as a service account
Permissions to all the resources referenced from instance templates, such
as images, disks, VPC networks, and subnets
Predefined Compute Engine IAM roles
With IAM, every API method in Compute Engine API requires
that the identity
making the API request has the appropriate permissions to use the resource.
Permissions are granted by setting policies that grant roles to a
member (user, group, or service account) of your project.
In addition to basic roles
( viewer, editor, owner )
and custom roles ,
you can assign the following Compute Engine predefined roles to the
members of your project.
You can grant multiple roles to a project member on the same resource. For
example, if your networking team also manages firewall rules, you can grant both
roles/compute.networkAdmin and roles/compute.securityAdmin to the networking
team's Google group .
The following tables describe the predefined Compute Engine
IAM roles,
as well as the permissions contained within each role. Each role contains a set
of permissions that is suitable for a specific task. For example, the Instance
Admin roles grant permissions to manage instances, the network-related roles
include permissions to manage network-related resources, and the security role
includes permissions to manage security-related resources, like firewalls and
SSL certificates. When working on Compute Engine, you might also need
roles for other services such as Cloud DNS and IAM
service accounts. For a full list of IAM roles, see the
IAM role reference documentation .

Compute Instance Admin (beta)
( roles/ compute.instanceAdmin )
Permissions to create, modify, and delete virtual machine instances.
This includes permissions to create, modify, and delete disks, and also to
configure Shielded VM
settings.
If the user will be managing virtual machine instances that are configured
to run as a service account, you must also grant the
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser role.
For example, if your company has someone who manages groups of virtual
machine instances but does not manage network or security settings and
does not manage instances that run as service accounts, you can grant this
role on the organization, folder, or project that contains the instances,
or you can grant it on individual instances.
Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:
Disk
Image
Instance

Compute Load Balancer Admin
( roles/ compute.loadBalancerAdmin )
Permissions to create, modify, and delete load balancers and associate
resources.
For example, if your company has a load balancing team that manages load
balancers, SSL certificates for load balancers, SSL policies, and other
load balancing resources, and a separate networking team that manages
the rest of the networking resources, then grant this role to the load
balancing team's group.
Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:

Compute Network Admin
( roles/ compute.networkAdmin )
Permissions to create, modify, and delete networking resources,
except for firewall rules and SSL certificates. The network admin role
allows read-only access to firewall rules, SSL certificates, and instances
(to view their ephemeral IP addresses). The network admin role does not
allow a user to create, start, stop, or delete instances.
For example, if your company has a security team that manages firewalls
and SSL certificates and a networking team that manages the rest of the
networking resources, then grant this role to the networking team's group.
Or, if you have a combined team that manages both security and networking,
then grant this role as well as the
roles/compute.securityAdmin role to the combined team's group.
Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role:

Compute Network User
( roles/ compute.networkUser )
Provides access to a shared VPC network
Once granted, service owners can use VPC networks and subnets that belong
to the host project. For example, a network user can create a VM instance
that belongs to a host project network but they cannot delete or create
new networks in the host project.

Available only at the organization level.
Access for an external user to set OS Login information associated with
this organization. This role does not grant access to instances. External
users must be granted one of the required
OS Login roles
in order to allow access to instances using SSH.

Compute Shared VPC Admin
( roles/ compute.xpnAdmin )
Permissions to administer shared VPC host projects,
specifically enabling the host projects and associating shared VPC service projects to the host
project's network.
At the organization level, this role can only be granted by an organization admin.
Google Cloud recommends that the Shared VPC Admin be the owner of the shared VPC host project. The
Shared VPC Admin is responsible for granting the Compute Network User role
( roles/compute.networkUser ) to service owners, and the shared VPC host project owner
controls the project itself. Managing the project is easier if a single principal (individual or
group) can fulfill both roles.
