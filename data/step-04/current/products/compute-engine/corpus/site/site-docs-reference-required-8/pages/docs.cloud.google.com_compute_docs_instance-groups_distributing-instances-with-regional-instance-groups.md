Create a MIG with VMs in multiple zones in a region
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes how to create a
managed instance group (MIG)
that has its VMs spread across multiple zones in a region. Spreading your
application load across multiple zones protects your workload against zonal
failures. If a zonal failure happens, your application can continue serving from
instances running in the remaining available zones in the same region.
This type of MIG is also known as a regional MIG . For more information, see
About regional MIGs .
You can also read about other
basic scenarios for creating a MIG .
Before you begin
Create
an instance template , which is required in order to create a managed
instance group.
If you haven't already, set up authentication .
Authentication verifies your identity for access to Google Cloud services and APIs. To run
code or samples from a local development environment, you can authenticate to
Compute Engine by selecting one of the following options:
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Console
When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
gcloud
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
After installation,
initialize the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
Set a default region and zone .
Terraform
To use the Terraform samples on this page in a local development environment, install and
initialize the gcloud CLI, and then set up Application Default Credentials with
your user credentials.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Set up authentication for a local development environment .
REST
To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the
credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Authenticate for using REST
in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.
Limitations
To see the full list of MIG limitations, which varies based on the configuration
that you use, see
MIG limitations .
Create a MIG with VMs in multiple zones in a region
Use the Google Cloud console , the
gcloud CLI ,
Terraform, or REST .
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have the following
permissions :
All permissions required to call the
regionInstanceGroupManagers.insert method .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Instance groups page.
Go to Instance groups
The remaining steps appear in the Google Cloud console.
Click Create instance group to create a new instance group.
Select one of the New managed instance group options :
Stateless (default)
Stateful
Assign a name and optionally a description to your instance group.
Choose an instance template for the instance group or
create a new one .
In Number of instances or in Autoscaling , specify the number of instances for this
group. Remember to
provision enough VMs to
support your application if a zone failure happens.
For Location , select Multiple zones .
Choose a region and select the zones you want to use. If you chose a regional instance template,
then the Region is automatically selected based on the template's region.
Under Target distribution shape , select Even . If you want to select a different
shape, see Set
a target distribution shape for VMs in a regional MIG .
If you want to disable proactive instance redistribution ,
then under Instance redistribution , deselect the Allow instance redistribution
checkbox.
Continue with the rest of the MIG creation process.
To create the MIG, click Create .
gcloud
All MIGs require an instance template. If you don't have one,
create an instance template .
For example, the following command creates an instance template in the
us-east1 region with default instance properties:
gcloud compute instance-templates create example-template --instance-template-region us-east1
When you create the MIG, you can specify either the ID or the name of an
instance template. Google recommends that you specify the ID because, unlike
names, instance template IDs can't be reused. To view the unique ID of
the instance template that you created, use the
describe command :
gcloud compute instance-templates describe example-template --region us-east1 --format="value(id)"
Next, use the
instance-groups managed create command
with the --region flag. For example, the following command creates a
regional MIG in three zones within the us-east1 region:
gcloud compute instance-groups managed create example-rmig \
--template projects/my-project/regions/us-east1/instanceTemplates/1234567890 \
--size 30 \
--region us-east1
If you want to select specific zones
that the group should use, provide the --zones flag:
gcloud compute instance-groups managed create example-rmig \
--template projects/my-project/regions/us-east1/instanceTemplates/1234567890 \
--size 30 \
--zones us-east1-b,us-east1-c
If you don't need to use specific zones, you can specify all zones and use a
balanced distribution shape. For more information, see
Distribution of VMs across zones .
If you want to disable proactive instance redistribution, see
Proactive instance redistribution .
Terraform
If you haven't already created an instance template, which specifies the
machine type, boot disk image, network, and other VM properties that you
want for each VM in your MIG, create an instance template .
To create a regional MIG, you can use the google_compute_region_instance_group_manager
resource .
resource "google_compute_region_instance_group_manager" "default" {
name = "example-rmig"
region = "us-east1"
distribution_policy_zones = ["us-east1-b", "us-east1-c"]
target_size = 30
base_instance_name = "instance"
version {
instance_template = google_compute_instance_template.default.id
}
}
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see
Basic Terraform commands .
REST
All MIGs require an instance template. If you don't have one,
create an instance template .
When you create the MIG, you can specify either the ID or the name of an
instance template. Google recommends that you specify the ID because, unlike
names, instance template IDs can't be be reused. To view the unique ID of
the instance template that you created, use the
get method on the
regional or
global instance template
that you created.
Next, construct a POST request to the
regionInstanceGroupManagers.insert method .
In the request body, specify the group name, group size, and the URL
to the instance template. Optionally, specify other fields, such as the base
name for instances in the group.
Note: When using REST to work with a regional MIG, always use the
regionInstanceGroupManagers resource .
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /instanceGroupManagers
{
"baseInstanceName": " BASE_INSTANCE_NAME ",
"instanceTemplate": " INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_URL ",
"name": " INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME ",
"targetSize": " TARGET_SIZE "
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project ID for this request.
REGION : the region for the group.
BASE_INSTANCE_NAME : (optional) the instance name
for each VM instance that is created as part of the group. For example, a
base instance name of example-instance creates instances that have names
like example-instance-[RANDOM_STRING] where [RANDOM_STRING] is
generated by the server.
INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_URL : the URL of the instance template that you want to
use to create instances in the MIG. The URL can contain either the
ID
or name of the instance template. Specify one of the following values:
For a regional instance template: projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /instanceTemplates/ INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_ID
For a global instance template: INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_ID
TARGET_SIZE : the target number of VMs for
the group.
If you want to
select specific zones
or if you are creating VMs in a region with less than or more than three
zones, include the distributionPolicy property in your request and supply
a list of zones. Replace ZONE with the name of a
zone to create VMs in.
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /instanceGroupManagers
{
"baseInstanceName": " BASE_INSTANCE_NAME ",
"instanceTemplate": " INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_URL ",
"name": " INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME ",
"targetSize": " TARGET_SIZE ",
"distributionPolicy": {
"zones": [
{"zone": "zones/ ZONE "},
{"zone": "zones/ ZONE "}
]
}
}
For example, the following creates a regional MIG named example-rmig
with 10 managed instances distributed across us-east1-b and us-east1-c
zones:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/regions/us-east1/instanceGroupManagers
{
"instanceTemplate": "projects/my-project/regions/us-east1/instanceTemplates/1234567890",
"name": "example-rmig",
"targetSize": 10,
"distributionPolicy": {
"zones": [
{"zone": "zones/us-east1-b"},
{"zone": "zones/us-east1-c"}
]
}
}
Depending on how you configure and act on a MIG, various policies and actions
can affect the instances in the group. To determine which managed
instances are up and running, see
Checking the status of managed instances .
If there is not enough capacity in each zone to support VMs for the
group, Compute Engine creates as many VMs as possible
and continues attempting to create the remaining VMs when additional
capacity becomes available.
If you don't explicitly specify individual zones in your request,
Compute Engine automatically chooses three zones to create VMs
in. If you need to create VMs in more than or fewer than three zones, or
you want to pick which zones are used, you can provide a list of zones in your
request. For more information, see
Zone selection .
Distribution of VMs across zones
By default, a regional MIG distributes VMs evenly across selected zones. Because
you are creating a regional MIG, keep in mind that certain resources are zonal,
such as GPUs and existing persistent disks. If your MIG's instance template
specifies zonal resources, you must make sure all those resources are present in
all selected zones so they can be attached to the VMs created by the regional
MIG. Alternatively, if you want the group to check for the existence of zonal
resources for you, you can set the MIG's target distribution shape to create
instances only in zones that contain those resources.
For more information, see the following documents:
Set a target distribution shape
for VMs across zones
Target shape limitations
Creating a group with a target distribution shape
Changing the target distribution shape of an existing group
Viewing the configured instance distribution policy
Proactive instance redistribution
Proactive instance redistribution
is enabled by default. If you need to manually manage the number of VMs in each
zone, or if you need to set the MIG's target distribution shape to BALANCED or
ANY_SINGLE_ZONE , you must disable proactive instance redistribution.
For more information, see the following documents:
