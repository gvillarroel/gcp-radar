Check VPN status
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
After you configure your peer VPN gateways, check the following components to
ensure that they are communicating correctly with Cloud VPN:
Check the status of the HA VPN or Classic VPN
tunnels that you configured, including the operational state.
Check the high availability status of tunnels on an
HA VPN gateway.
View the status of Cloud Router Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) sessions or
the routes that Cloud Router is advertising.
For more information about Cloud VPN, see the following resources:
For best practices to consider before setting up Cloud VPN, see
Best practices .
For more information about Cloud VPN, see the
Cloud VPN overview .
For definitions of terms used on this page, see
Key terms .
Check HA VPN tunnels
Use this procedure to check the status of tunnels on both interfaces of
an HA VPN gateway.
Caution: When using HA VPN, you should also check the
high-availability status of tunnels on your VPN gateway to
ensure that you are receiving the 99.99% availability SLA.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPN page.
Go to VPN
View the VPN tunnel status and the BGP
session status .
To view tunnel details, click the Name of a tunnel.
Under Logs , click View for Cloud Logging logs.
You can also modify the BGP session associated with this tunnel.
gcloud
There are two steps to viewing tunnel status. First, identify the tunnel
name and region, and then use the describe command option to view tunnel
details.
In the following commands, replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your project
GW_NAME : the name of the gateway
REGION : the region where the gateway or tunnel resides
NAME : the name of the tunnel
To view tunnel status, complete the following steps:
Identify the name and region of the VPN tunnel whose status you
need to check. You can identify the tunnel by using either of the
following methods:
Option 1: To list all VPN tunnels in your project, run the
following command:
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels list
--project= PROJECT_ID
The command output should look similar to the following example:
NAME REGION GATEWAY VPN_INTERFACE PEER_ADDRESS
tunnel-a-to-b-if-0 us-central1 ha-vpn-gw-a 0 10.242.123.165
tunnel-a-to-b-if-1 us-central1 ha-vpn-gw-a 1 10.220.75.213
tunnel-b-to-a-if-0 us-central1 ha-vpn-gw-b 0 10.242.127.148
tunnel-b-to-a-if-1 us-central1 ha-vpn-gw-b 1 10.220.66.156
Option 2: If you know the name of the VPN gateway that contains
the tunnel, to retrieve the list of the gateway's associated
tunnels, run the following command:
gcloud compute vpn-gateways describe GW_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--format='flattened(tunnels)'
After you know the name and region of the tunnel, use the describe
option of the vpn-tunnels command to determine the tunnel's status:
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels describe NAME \
--region= REGION \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--format='flattened(status,detailedStatus)'
The basic status message and a more detailed message are returned.
The command output should look similar to the following example.
For a full listing, omit the --format option.
detailedStatus: Tunnel is up and running.
The following four command output examples show a full listing for a pair
of tunnels on each of two HA VPN gateways that are
connected to each other. That is, on ha-vpn-gw-a , the tunnels on
interface 0 and interface 1 are connected to tunnels on the
corresponding interfaces of ha-vpn-gw-b .

Check high availability status for HA VPN gateways
Note: For configurations that do or don't guarantee 99.99% availability, see
Cloud VPN topologies .
To check the high-availability configuration status for tunnels on an
HA VPN gateway, use the Google Cloud console, the
compute vpn-gateways get-status command, or the vpnGateways.getStatus method.
The output displays the high-availability redundancy
requirement state for VPN tunnels associated with each peer gateway to which the
HA VPN gateway is connected.
The peer gateway can be another HA VPN gateway or an
external VPN gateway. If there are multiple peer gateways connected to the
HA VPN gateway, multiple high-availability configuration
statuses are displayed, one status per each peer gateway.
The command output indicates the correct tunnel amount and coverage in the
following ways:
VPN gateways configured with adequate redundancy (coverage) show the
following status:
HighAvailabilityRedundancyRequirementState: CONNECTION_REDUNDANCY_MET .
VPN gateways that are not configured with adequate redundancy show the
following status:
HighAvailabilityRedundancyRequirementState: CONNECTION_REDUNDANCY_NOT_MET .
If there are not enough tunnels configured between your
HA VPN gateway and another HA VPN
gateway or a peer gateway, the command output shows the following status:
redundancyUnsatisfiedReason: INCOMPLETE_TUNNELS_COVERAGE .
For additional information, see
View logs and metrics .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPN page.
Go to VPN
To view gateway details for the gateway and its tunnels, click
Gateway name . For HA VPN gateways, you can also
view high-availability status for the gateway.
gcloud
To display tunnel status for the HA VPN gateway,
run the following command. Replace the following:
GW_NAME : the name of the HA VPN
gateway
REGION : the region where the gateway resides
gcloud compute vpn-gateways get-status GW_NAME \
--region= REGION
The following command output example shows information for an
HA VPN gateway connected to a peer gateway with two
interfaces:
peerGateways:
— peerExternalGateway: peer-gw
