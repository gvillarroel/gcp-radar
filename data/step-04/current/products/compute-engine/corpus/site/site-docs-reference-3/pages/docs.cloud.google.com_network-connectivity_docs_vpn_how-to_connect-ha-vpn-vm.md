Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to connect an HA VPN gateway to
Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances with external IP addresses
hosted in Google Cloud.
These instructions create the following HA VPN resources:
An HA VPN gateway
A peer VPN gateway
A pair of VPN tunnels from the peer VPN gateway to each VM instance to help
ensure high availability
For more information about Cloud VPN, see the following resources:
For diagrams of this topology, see
HA VPN to Compute Engine VM instances in
multiple zones and
HA VPN to a Compute Engine VM instance .
For best practices to consider before setting up Cloud VPN, see
Best practices .
For more information about Cloud VPN, see the
Cloud VPN overview .
For definitions of terms used on this page, see
Key terms .
Before you begin
Review information about how
dynamic routing
works in Google Cloud.
Ensure that your peer VPN gateway supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
Ensure that you have one or two Compute Engine VMs
with external IP addresses.
Set up the following items in Google Cloud to make it easier to configure
Cloud VPN:
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.

If you are using the Google Cloud CLI, set your project ID with the
following command. The gcloud instructions on this page assume
that you have set your project ID before issuing commands.
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
You can also view a project ID that has already been set by
running the following command:
gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)'
Note: Instructions in this guide are written from the point of view of your
VPC network and Cloud VPN gateway.
Create a custom VPC network and subnet
Note: The examples in this document use one VPC network with one
subnet in one Google Cloud region . However,
your requirements might be different.
Before creating an HA VPN gateway and tunnel pair,
create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network and at least one subnet in the region
where the HA VPN gateway resides:
To create a custom mode VPC network (recommended), see
Creating a custom mode VPC network .
To create subnets, see Working with subnets .
To enable IPv6 for HA VPN gateways, you
must enable the allocation of IPv6 internal addresses when you create
the VPC. In addition, you must configure the subnets
to use IPv6 internal addresses.
You must also configure IPv6 on the VMs in the subnet.
To create a custom mode VPC network with internal IPv6 addresses, see
Create a custom mode VPC network with at least one dual stack subnet .
To create a subnet with IPv6 enabled, see Add a dual-stack subnet .
To enable IPv6 in an existing subnet, see Convert an IPv4 subnet to a dual stack subnet .
To create VMs with IPv6 enabled, see
Configuring IPv6 for instances and instance templates .
The VPC subnet must be configured to use internal IPv6 addresses.
When you use the gcloud CLI, you configure the subnet with the
--ipv6-access-type=INTERNAL flag. Cloud Router does not dynamically
advertise routes for subnets that are configured to use external IPv6 addresses
( --ipv6-access-type=EXTERNAL ).
For information about using internal IPv6 ranges in your VPC
network and subnets, see
Internal IPv6 specifications .
The examples in this document also use VPC global dynamic
routing mode , which behaves in the
following way:
All instances of Cloud Router apply the to on-premises routes
that they learn to all subnets of the VPC network.
Routes to all subnets in the VPC network are shared with
on-premises routers.
Create an HA VPN gateway and tunnels to Compute Engine VM instances
Follow the instructions in this section to create an HA VPN
gateway, a peer VPN gateway resource, tunnels, and BGP sessions.
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or the following IAM roles.
Permissions
compute.vpnGateways.get
compute.vpnGateways.list
compute.externalVpnGateways.get
compute.externalVpnGateways.list
compute.vpnGateways.create
compute.vpnGateways.delete
compute.vpnGateways.get
compute.vpnGateways.list

compute.vpnGateways.setLabels
compute.externalVpnGateways.create
compute.externalVpnGateways.delete
compute.externalVpnGateways.get
compute.externalVpnGateways.list
compute.externalVpnGateways.use
compute.externalVpnGateways.setLabels
Roles
roles/compute.networkAdmin
Note:
After you create an HA VPN gateway, you cannot modify its stack type.
If you need a different stack type for an existing HA VPN gateway, you must delete and recreate the gateway.
To support IPv6 traffic, HA VPN gateways must use either the IPv4 and IPv6 (dual-stack) or IPv6 (single-stack) configuration. To temporarily disable IPv6 traffic without deleting your gateway,
disable IPv6 route exchange in the IPv4 BGP session or
disable the IPv6 session that you established for the HA VPN tunnels.
Console
To create a VPN connection for the first time, use the VPN setup wizard.
The VPN setup wizard includes all required configuration steps
for creating an HA VPN gateway, a peer VPN gateway
resource, tunnels, and BGP sessions.
Create Cloud HA VPN gateway
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPN page.
Go to VPN
If you are creating a gateway for the first time, click
Create VPN connection .
If you have existing Cloud VPN resources, click
VPN setup wizard .
Select High-availability (HA) VPN .
Click Continue .
Specify a VPN gateway name .
In the Network list, select an existing network or the
default network.
In the Region list, select the same region where
your Compute Engine VMs are located.
Select a stack type for the VPN gateway, either
IPv4 (single-stack) or IPv4 and IPv6 (dual-stack) .
Click Create and continue .
The console page displays the gateway information. Two external IP addresses
are automatically allocated for each of your gateway interfaces. For future
configuration steps, make note of the details of your gateway configuration.
Add VPN tunnels
Important: You can create a pair of tunnels at once. To create a second pair,
use the wizard after creating the first pair.
In the Peer VPN gateway list, select Compute Engine VMs with external IP addresses .
In the Peer VPN gateway name list, choose an existing peer gateway or
click Create a new peer VPN gateway .
If you choose an existing peer gateway, the Google Cloud console selects
the number of tunnels to configure based on the number of peer interfaces
that you configured on the peer gateway.
To create a peer gateway, complete the following steps:
Specify a name for the peer VPN gateway.
In the Peer VPN gateway interfaces section, select one or two
interfaces.
You can connect a pair of tunnels to each Compute Engine VM
instance. For examples of this topology, see
HA VPN topologies .
In the field for each peer VPN interface, specify the external IP
address used for that interface.
In the Cloud Router list, select or create a
Cloud Router by specifying the following options.
To create a new Cloud Router, specify the following:
A Name
An optional Description
A Google ASN for the new router
You can use any private ASN
( 64512 through 65534 , 4200000000 through 4294967294 )
that you are not using elsewhere in your network. The Google ASN is
used for all BGP sessions on the same Cloud Router, and you
cannot change the ASN later.
To create the router, click Create .
In the VPN tunnels section, expand each item to fill in the details
of created VPN tunnels.
In the Associated peer VPN gateway interface section, select the
peer VPN gateway interface and IP address combination that you want to
associate with this tunnel and with the HA VPN
interface. This interface must match the interface on your actual peer
router.
Specify a Name for the tunnel.
Specify an optional Description .
Specify the IKE version . We recommend IKEv2, the default setting,
if your peer router supports it. To allow IPv6 traffic, you must
select IKEv2.
Specify an IKE pre-shared key by using your pre-shared key (shared
secret), which must correspond with the pre-shared key for the partner
tunnel that you create on your peer gateway. If you haven't configured
a pre-shared key on your peer VPN gateway and want to generate one,
click Generate and copy . Make sure that you record the
pre-shared key in a secure location because it cannot be retrieved
after you create your VPN tunnels.
Click Done .
On the Create a VPN page, repeat the tunnel creation steps for
any remaining tunnel dialogs.
When you have configured all tunnels, click Create and continue .
Configure BGP sessions
Click Configure BGP Session to set up the BGP session on the
Cloud Router.
For information about creating BGP sessions, see
Create BGP sessions .
Click Save BGP configuration .
The console page refreshes and displays the information about the
HA VPN gateway, peer VPN gateway, and Cloud VPN
tunnel information.
gcloud
Create an HA VPN gateway
To create an HA VPN gateway, run the following
command. When the gateway is created, two external IPv4 addresses are
automatically allocated, one for each gateway interface.
gcloud compute vpn-gateways create GW_NAME \
--network= NETWORK \
--region= REGION \
[--stack-type= IP_STACK ]
Replace the following:
GW_NAME : the name of the gateway
NETWORK : the name of your Google Cloud network
REGION : the Google Cloud region
where you create the gateway and tunnel
IP_STACK : Optional: the IP stack to use. Specify
either IPV4_ONLY or IPV4_IPV6 .
If you don't specify this flag,
the default stack type is IPV4_ONLY .
The gateway that you create looks similar to the following example
output. An external IPv4 address is automatically assigned to each
gateway interface:
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/vpnGateways/ha-vpn-gw-a].
NAME INTERFACE0 INTERFACE1 NETWORK REGION
ha-vpn-gw-a 203.0.113.16 203.0.113.23 network-a us-central1
Create a peer VPN gateway resource
Depending on the high availability needs, you can create one or a pair of
peer VPN gateway resources.
To create the first peer VPN gateway, run the following command:
gcloud compute external-vpn-gateways create PEER_GW_NAME1 \
--interfaces 0= PEER_GW_IP_0 ,1= PEER_GW_IP_1
To create the second peer VPN gateway, run the following command:
gcloud compute external-vpn-gateways create PEER_GW_NAME2 \
--interfaces 0= PEER_GW_IP_1 ,1= PEER_GW_IP_0
Replace the following:
PEER_GW_NAME1 : a name representing the first peer VPN gateway
PEER_GW_NAME2 : a name representing the second peer VPN gateway
PEER_GW_IP_1 : the external IP address for the first Compute Engine virtual machine
PEER_GW_IP_0 : the external IP address for the second Compute Engine virtual machine
The peer VPN gateway resource that you created looks like the
following example, and PEER_GW_IP_0 and
PEER_GW_IP_1 show the external IP addresses of the
Compute Engine virtual machines:
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/externalVpnGateways/peer-gw].
NAME INTERFACE0 INTERFACE1
peer-gw-1 203.0.113.16 203.0.113.23
Peer-gw-2 203.0.113.23 203.0.113.16
Create a Cloud Router
To create a Cloud Router, run the following command:
gcloud compute routers create ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--network= NETWORK \
--asn= GOOGLE_ASN
Replace the following:
ROUTER_NAME : the name of the Cloud Router
in the same region as the Cloud VPN gateway
REGION : the Google Cloud
region where you create the
gateway and tunnel
NETWORK : the name of your Google Cloud network
GOOGLE_ASN : any private ASN
( 64512 through 65534 , 4200000000 through 4294967294 )
that you are not already using in the peer network; the Google ASN is
used for all BGP sessions on the same Cloud Router, and it
cannot be changed later
The output is similar to the following:
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
NAME REGION NETWORK
router-a us-central1 network-a
Add VPN tunnels
Create four VPN tunnels, two for each interface on the
HA VPN gateway. When creating VPN tunnels, specify
the peer side of the VPN tunnels as the external VPN gateway that you
created earlier.
One VPN tunnel must connect to interface 0 of the
external VPN gateway, and the other VPN tunnel must connect to
interface 1 of the external VPN gateway.
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create TUNNEL_NAME_IF0 \
--peer-external-gateway= PEER_GW_NAME1 \
--peer-external-gateway-interface= PEER_EXT_GW_IF0 \
--region= REGION \
--ike-version= IKE_VERS \
--shared-secret= SHARED_SECRET \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--vpn-gateway= GW_NAME \
--interface= INT_NUM_0
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create TUNNEL_NAME_IF1 \
--peer-external-gateway= PEER_GW_NAME1 \
--peer-external-gateway-interface= PEER_EXT_GW_IF1 \
--region= REGION \
--ike-version= IKE_VERS \
--shared-secret= SHARED_SECRET \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--vpn-gateway= GW_NAME \
--interface= INT_NUM_1
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create TUNNEL_NAME_IF2 \
--peer-external-gateway= PEER_GW_NAME2 \
--peer-external-gateway-interface= PEER_EXT_GW_IF0 \
--region= REGION \
--ike-version= IKE_VERS \
--shared-secret= SHARED_SECRET \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--vpn-gateway= GW_NAME \
--interface= INT_NUM_0
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create TUNNEL_NAME_IF3 \
--peer-external-gateway= PEER_GW_NAME2 \
--peer-external-gateway-interface= PEER_EXT_GW_IF1 \
--region= REGION \
--ike-version= IKE_VERS \
--shared-secret= SHARED_SECRET \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--vpn-gateway= GW_NAME \
--interface= INT_NUM_1
Replace the following:
TUNNEL_NAME_IF0 , TUNNEL_NAME_IF1
TUNNEL_NAME_IF2 , and TUNNEL_NAME_IF3 :
a name for the tunnel; naming the tunnels by including the gateway
interface name can help identify the tunnels later
PEER_GW_NAME : a name of the external peer gateway
created earlier
PEER_EXT_GW_IF0 and PEER_EXT_GW_IF1 :
the interface number configured earlier on the external peer gateway
IKE_VERS : 1 for IKEv1 or 2 for IKEv2; if
possible, use IKEv2 for the IKE version. If your peer gateway requires
IKEv1, replace --ike-version 2 with --ike-version 1 . To
allow IPv6 traffic, you must specify IKEv2.
SHARED_SECRET : your pre-shared key (shared secret),
which must correspond with the pre-shared key for the partner tunnel
that you create on your peer gateway; for recommendations, see
Generate a strong pre-shared key
GW_NAME : the name of the HA VPN
gateway
INT_NUM_0 : the number 0 for the first interface
on the HA VPN gateway that you created earlier
INT_NUM_1 : the number 1 for the second interface
on the HA VPN gateway that you created earlier
Optional: the --vpn-gateway-region is the region of the
HA VPN gateway to operate on. Its value should
be the same as --region . If not specified, this option is
automatically set. This option overrides the default compute or region
property value for this command invocation.
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/vpnTunnels/tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0].
NAME REGION GATEWAY VPN_INTERFACE PEER_GATEWAY PEER_INTERFACE

}
Add VPN tunnels
To create four VPN tunnels, two for each interface on the
HA VPN gateway, make a POST request by using the
vpnTunnels.insert method .
To get a 99.9% uptime SLA, you must create a tunnel
on each interface of your HA VPN gateway.
To create the first tunnel, run the following command:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /vpnTunnels
{
"name": "ha-vpn-gw-a-tunnel-0",

"network": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/network-a",
"stackType": "IPV4_IPV6"
}
The stackType field is optional. The only valid values are IPV4_IPV6 or
IPV4_ONLY .
If you don't specify a stackType , the default is IPV4_ONLY .
Verify the configuration
Console
To verify the configuration, go to the Summary and reminder page:
The Summary section of this page lists information for the
HA VPN gateway and the peer VPN gateway profile.
For each VPN tunnel, you can view the VPN tunnel
status ,
the BGP session name , the
BGP session
status ,
and the MED value (advertised route priority).
The Reminder section of this page lists the steps that you must
complete to have a fully operational VPN connection between
Cloud VPN and your peer VPN.
After reviewing the information on
this page, click OK .
gcloud
To verify the Cloud Router configuration, follow these steps:
List the BGP IP addresses chosen by Cloud Router.
If you added a new interface to an existing
Cloud Router, the BGP IP addresses for the new
interface are listed with the highest index number. Use the
BGP IP address peerIpAddress to configure your peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers get-status ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--format='flattened(result.bgpPeerStatus[].name,
result.bgpPeerStatus[].ipAddress, result.bgpPeerStatus[].peerIpAddress)'
The expected output for a Cloud Router managing two
Cloud VPN tunnels (index 0 and index 1 ) looks
like the following example where the following is true:
GOOGLE_BGP_IP_0 represents the BGP IP address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on Cloud VPN
gateway interface 0 ; PEER_BGP_IP_0 represents the
BGP IP address of its peer.
GOOGLE_BGP_IP_1 represents the BGP IP address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on Cloud VPN
gateway interface 1 ; PEER_BGP_IP_1
represents the BGP IP address of its peer.
result.bgpPeerStatus[0].ipAddress: 169.254.0.1 GOOGLE_BGP_IP_0
result.bgpPeerStatus[0].name: bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0
result.bgpPeerStatus[0].peerIpAddress: 169.254.0.2 PEER_BGP_IP_0
result.bgpPeerStatus[1].ipAddress: 169.254.1.1 GOOGLE_BGP_IP_1
result.bgpPeerStatus[1].name: bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-1
result.bgpPeerStatus[1].peerIpAddress: 169.254.1.2 PEER_BGP_IP_1
You can also use the following command to get a full listing of the
Cloud Router configuration:
gcloud compute routers describe ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION
The full listing looks like the following example:
bgp:
advertiseMode: DEFAULT
