Advanced configurations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes advanced configuration details for the following
scenarios:
High-availability VPNs
High-throughput VPNs
Multiple subnet VPNs
To learn about the basic concepts of Cloud VPN, see the
Cloud VPN overview .
Order of routes
You can create a VPN tunnel that has the same IP range as another tunnel,
a subset of the other tunnel's range, or a superset of the other tunnel's range.
For details, see
Order of routes .
Configure IKE, including multiple subnet support
In Supported IKE ciphers ,
you can find details about how Cloud VPN supports multiple
IKE ciphers.
In Networks and tunnel routing ,
you can find information about supported Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks
and routing options, including traffic selectors.
UDP encapsulation
Cloud VPN only supports one-to-one NAT by using UDP encapsulation for
NAT-Traversal (NAT-T). NAT-T is required so that IPsec traffic can reach
destinations without external (public) IP addresses behind the NAT.
One-to-many NAT and port-based address translation are
not supported. In other words, Cloud VPN cannot connect to
multiple peer VPN gateways
that share a single external IP address.
For more details about VPN gateways behind one-to-one NAT, see
On-premises gateways behind NAT
on the Troubleshooting page.
Maximum transmission unit (MTU) considerations
The Cloud VPN MTU size is 1460 bytes. For a description of how to
configure your peer VPN gateway to support this MTU size if required, see
MTU considerations .
High-availability VPNs, high-throughput VPNs, and failover
HA VPN is the recommended method of implementing
high-availability VPNs and high-throughput VPNs. If your peer VPN gateway
supports BGP, you can configure an
HA VPN gateway with a 99.99% uptime SLA
by using an
active/active or active/passive
tunnel configuration.
Caution: We recommend that you use an active/passive configuration only
with one HA VPN gateway. If you use an active/passive
configuration across multiple HA VPN gateways , with an
active and passive tunnel pair configured on each gateway,
HA VPN doesn't use the passive tunnels for failover until
all the active tunnels on all gateways have failed. Configuring multiple
gateways with an active/passive configuration can cause bandwidth loss.
For Classic VPN gateways, you can provide VPN redundancy
and failover by using these
throughput and load balancing options .
However, with this configuration, you receive a 99.9% availability SLA.
