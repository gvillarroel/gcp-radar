Classic VPN dynamic routing deprecation
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Dynamic routing or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for Classic VPN
tunnels is deprecated on August 1, 2025. If your workloads require BGP
for VPN connectivity, you must use HA VPN.
For information about HA VPN, see the
Cloud VPN overview .
The rest of this page helps you with planning and implementing your
migration.
Deprecated configurations
You cannot create new Classic VPN tunnels that use
dynamic routing (BGP) that is managed by a Cloud Router.
As of August 1, 2025, the creation of Classic VPN tunnels
using dynamic routing (BGP) is no longer supported, regardless of the gateway
the tunnel connects to. This includes connections to VPN gateway software running
inside a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance or connections
outside of Google Cloud.
Existing Classic VPN tunnels that use dynamic routing (BGP)
aren't supported. Tunnels that are in use will continue to function,
but without an availability SLA.
What happens to deprecated configurations?
If you delete a Classic VPN tunnel that was configured with BGP,
you can't recreate it with BGP support. Existing, unmodified
Classic VPN tunnels can continue to pass traffic (without SLA).
For any changes requiring recreation or modification of BGP settings
configurations, you must use HA VPN.
Supported configurations
You can continue to create and receive support only for the following
Classic VPN configurations:
Classic VPN tunnels using static routing from
Classic VPN gateways to on-premises VPN gateways and from
on-premises VPN gateways to Classic VPN gateways.
Classic VPN tunnels using static routing from a
Classic VPN gateway to and from a Compute Engine VM
that is acting as a VPN gateway.
Recommendations
For all production traffic requiring dynamic routing (BGP),
use HA VPN.
We recommend that you only retain Classic VPN if your
on-premises VPN devices don't support BGP, and therefore
HA VPN cannot be used. However, we strongly recommend
upgrading those devices to support BGP because HA VPN
provides a more flexible, reliable, and highly available solution compared
to static routing, and is the only path for BGP functionality within
Cloud VPN.
For more information, see
HA VPN topologies .
Billing changes
After instantiating and using the additional, redundant tunnel for
HA VPN, you will see billing changes as described on
the Cloud VPN pricing page .
To achieve high availability, HA VPN requires you to
create VPN tunnels in pairs. Both tunnels are billed at the same hourly rate.
If you use one tunnel solely for failover, outbound data transfer charges apply
only to the active tunnel.
As of August 1, 2025, any traffic that hasn't been migrated to
HA VPN and continues to flow through established
Classic VPN gateways and tunnels is charged at the standard
Classic VPN rates.
Move to HA VPN
To move to HA VPN, you might need to make some routing or
infrastructure changes to support HA VPN. Your network
administrators or site reliability engineers (SREs)
need to schedule a maintenance window
to perform the migration.
To plan and prepare, watch the following video,
Upgrade to Google's HA VPN ,
for guidance on key use cases.
When your organization is ready to switch your production workflows from
Classic VPN to HA VPN, use the checklists
and instructions provided in Move to HA VPN .
