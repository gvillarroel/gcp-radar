Direct Peering overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Direct Peering enables you to establish a direct
peering
connection between your business network and Google's edge network and exchange
high-throughput cloud traffic.
This capability is available at any of more than 100 locations in 33 countries
around the world. For more information about Google's edge locations, see
Google's peering site .
When established, Direct Peering provides a direct path from your on-premises
network to Google services, including Google Cloud products that
can be exposed through one or more public IP addresses. Traffic from Google's
network to your on-premises network also takes that direct path, including
traffic from VPC networks in your projects.
Direct Peering exists outside of Google Cloud. Unless you need to access
Google Workspace applications, the recommended methods of access to Google Cloud are
Dedicated Interconnect
or Partner Interconnect .
For a description of the differences between Direct Peering and
Cloud Interconnect, see the
comparison table .
Considerations
If used with Google Cloud, Direct Peering doesn't produce
any custom routes in a VPC network. Traffic sent from
resources in a VPC network leaves by way of a route whose next
hop is either a default internet gateway (a default route, for example) or a
Cloud VPN tunnel.
To send traffic through Direct Peering by using a route whose next hop is a
Cloud VPN tunnel, the IP address of your on-premises network's VPN
gateway must be in your configured destination range.
Service level
Google does not offer a service level agreement (SLA) with Direct Peering.
For customers who are interested in an SLA, we recommend using
Cloud Interconnect .
Who can peer with Google?
Google recommends Google Cloud customers to use a Verified Peering Provider
instead of Direct Peering.
Connecting with a Verified Peering Provider lets Google customers reach all publicly
available Google resources without the complexity of managing
Direct Peering connectivity to Google.
Google Cloud customers that choose a Verified Peering Provider do not need to meet
Google's Direct Peering requirements and can work directly with a
Verified Peering Provider to acquire internet services that provide access to Google.
To view a list of available Verified Peering Providers, see their connectivity to
Google, learn about their services, and find providers in different
areas, see the Google Edge Network .
Google recommends Google Cloud customers who do not use a
Verified Peering Provider to privately peer with Google. Private peering lets a
network connect directly with Google over a dedicated physical link known
as a private network interconnect (PNI).
When privately peering, Google requires physical redundancy with at least two
separate connections to Google in a single metropolitan area. Each physical
connection must have its own IP addressing.
Any Google Cloud customers that meet Google's technical peering
requirements can be considered for Direct Peering. Google can peer at
locations listed in our PeeringDB entry .
For more information about requirements, and to review Google's peering best
practices for Google Cloud customers,
visit Google peering .
Getting started
To request that a new peering connection be established,
register your interest
with our peering team. If you meet the posted technical requirements,
a Google representative will contact you with further details to guide you
through the application process.
