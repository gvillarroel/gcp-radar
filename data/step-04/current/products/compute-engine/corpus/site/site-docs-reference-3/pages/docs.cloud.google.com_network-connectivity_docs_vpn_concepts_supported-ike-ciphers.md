Supported IKE ciphers
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cloud VPN supports the following ciphers and configuration parameters
for peer VPN devices or VPN services. Cloud VPN automatically
negotiates the connection as long as the peer side uses a supported
Internet Key Exchange (IKE) cipher setting.
For configuration instructions, see Configure
the peer VPN gateway .
Cloud VPN operates in IPsec ESP Tunnel Mode.
The following IKE ciphers are supported for Classic VPN and
HA VPN.
Note: IPv6 traffic, which is only supported by HA VPN, requires
IKEv2.
IPv6 address support for HA VPN
gateway interfaces is in Preview .
Proposal order
Cloud VPN can act as an initiator or a responder to IKE requests
depending on the origin of traffic when a new security association is
needed.
When Cloud VPN initiates a VPN connection, Cloud VPN
proposes the cipher algorithms
configured in the Cloud VPN tunnel. If you have not
configured the cipher algorithms,
then the Cloud VPN tunnel proposes the cipher algorithms in the
order shown in the supported cipher
tables for each cipher role. The peer side receiving the proposal selects an
algorithm.
If the peer side initiates the connection, then Cloud VPN selects a
cipher from the proposal by using the same order as configured or shown in the table for each
cipher role.
Depending on which side is the initiator or the responder, the selected
cipher can be different. For example, the selected cipher might even change over
time as new security associations (SAs) are created during key rotation. Because
a change in cipher selection can impact important tunnel characteristics such as
performance or MTU, use a stable cipher selection. For more
information about MTU, see
MTU considerations .
To prevent frequent changes in cipher selection, configure your peer VPN
gateway and the Cloud VPN tunnel to propose and accept
only one cipher for each cipher role. This cipher
must be supported by both Cloud VPN and your peer VPN gateway. Do not
provide a list of ciphers for each cipher role. This best practice ensures that
both sides of your Cloud VPN tunnel always select the same IKE cipher
during IKE negotiation.
Cloud Location Finder helps you identify the closest Google Cloud regions and zones to your
physical locations worldwide. By using Cloud Location Finder, you can make informed decisions
about which Google Cloud region to deploy your Cloud VPN gateways in, potentially
optimizing for latency, geographic location, and carbon energy usage. For more information,
see the Cloud Location Finder documentation.
For HA VPN tunnel pairs, configure both
HA VPN tunnels on your peer VPN gateway to use the same
cipher and IKE Phase 2 lifetime values.
Note: You can configure cipher algorithms for
HA VPN topologies that connect VPC networks. If you don't
configure cipher algorithms, then the HA VPN gateways auto-negotiate
the cipher consistently no matter which side initiates the connection.
IKE fragmentation
Cloud VPN supports IKE fragmentation as
described by the IKEv2 fragmentation protocol
( RFC 7383 ).
For best results, Google recommends that you enable IKE fragmentation, if it
is not already enabled, on your peer VPN device.
If you don't have IKE
fragmentation enabled, IKE packets from Google Cloud to the peer VPN device
that are larger than the gateway MTU are dropped.
Some IKE messages can't be fragmented, including the following messages:
IKE_SA_INIT
IKE_SESSION_RESUME
For more information, see the Limitations section
in RFC 7383 .
Supported cipher tables
The following sections list the supported ciphers for Cloud VPN.
