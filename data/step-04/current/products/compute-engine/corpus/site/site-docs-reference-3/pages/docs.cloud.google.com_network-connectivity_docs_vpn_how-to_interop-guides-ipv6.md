Set up third-party VPNs for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides instructions for configuring third-party VPN devices
to support dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) or IPv6-only traffic with Cloud VPN.
To enable dual-stack traffic in your HA VPN tunnels, you must
configure your peer VPN gateway with IPv6 next-hop addresses. In
HA VPN tunnels with dual-stack traffic enabled, IPv4 and IPv6
routes are exchanged over BGP sessions by using multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) with
link-local IPv4 addresses. Both the Cloud Router and your peer VPN gateway
need IPv6 next hop configuration to route IPv6 traffic to and from the
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and your peer networks.
Only HA VPN gateways support dual-stack or
IPv6-only traffic. Classic VPN does not support IPv6 traffic.
Make sure that your peer VPN gateway is configured to use IKEv2 for its
HA VPN tunnels.
Third-party VPN support for dual-stack traffic
The following table summarizes third-party VPN device support for dual-stack
traffic over IPsec tunnels.
Note: Vendors are continuously adding support for dual-stack traffic. For the
latest updates, refer to your vendor's platform documentation.

Juniper JunOS
The following procedure describes how to set up your Juniper JunOS VPN device
to support IPv4 and IPv6 traffic in your HA VPN tunnels.
Note: These instructions provide only configuration examples for IPv4 BGP sessions
that use multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) to exchange both IPv4 and IPv6 routes. These
instructions don't provide IPv6 BGP configuration examples.
Although you configure IPv6 addresses on the tunnel interfaces of the device,
the IPv6 addresses are solely used for IPv6 next hop configuration. IPv6 routes
are advertised through IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) over
IPv4 BGP peering.
Before you begin
In Google Cloud, set up
one dual-stack HA VPN gateway and two HA VPN tunnels .
Both HA VPN tunnels carry IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
Record the two external IPv4 addresses that Google Cloud assigns to the
two HA VPN gateway interfaces.
Record the following configuration values for each tunnel:
The link-local IPv4 address of the BGP peer, which is your Juniper JunOS device
The link-local IPv4 address of the Cloud Router used for BGP peering
The IPv6 next hop address assigned to the peer or peerIpv6NexthopAddress
The ASN you assigned to the Cloud Router for your BGP sessions
The ASN you assigned to the BGP peer, which is your Juniper JunOS device
The pre-shared key
To find the details for your BGP session configuration,
see View BGP session configuration .
Configure JunOS
To configure JunOS devices, complete the following steps:
For each VPN tunnel interface, configure the BGP peer IPv6 next hop addresses
that you retrieved from the Cloud Router. These interfaces are the
same interfaces that are assigned link-local addresses for IPv4 peering.
set interfaces st0 unit 1 family inet mtu 1460
set interfaces st0 unit 1 family inet address PEER_BGP_IP_1
set interfaces st0 unit 1 family inet6 address PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1
set interfaces st0 unit 2 family inet mtu 1460
set interfaces st0 unit 2 family inet address PEER_BGP_IP_2
set interfaces st0 unit 2 family inet6 address PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2
Replace the following values:
PEER_BGP_IP_1 : the BGP IPv4 address of the peer for the first tunnel
interface with its subnet mask
PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1 : the IPv6 next hop address of the peer
for the first tunnel interface with its subnet mask
PEER_BGP_IP_2 : the BGP IPv4 address of the peer for the second tunnel
interface with its subnet mask
PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2 : the IPv6 next hop address of the peer
for the second tunnel interface with its subnet mask
For example:
set interfaces st0 unit 1 family inet mtu 1460
set interfaces st0 unit 1 family inet address 169.254.0.2/30
set interfaces st0 unit 1 family inet6 address 2600:2d00:0:2::2/125
set interfaces st0 unit 2 family inet mtu 1460
set interfaces st0 unit 2 family inet address 169.254.1.2/30
set interfaces st0 unit 2 family inet6 address 2600:2d00:0:2::1:2/125
Configure the IKE proposal, IKE policy, and IKE gateway objects.
Note: IPv6 support in HA VPN requires IKEv2.
# IKE proposal
set security ike proposal ike_prop authentication-method pre-shared-keys
set security ike proposal ike_prop dh-group group2
set security ike proposal ike_prop authentication-algorithm sha-256
set security ike proposal ike_prop encryption-algorithm aes-256-cbc
set security ike proposal ike_prop lifetime-seconds 36000
# IKE policy
set security ike policy ike_pol mode main
set security ike policy ike_pol proposals ike_prop
set security ike policy ike_pol pre-shared-key ascii-text SHARED_SECRET
# IKE gateway objects
set security ike gateway gw1 ike-policy ike_pol
set security ike gateway gw1 address HA_VPN_INTERFACE_ADDRESS_0
set security ike gateway gw1 local-identity inet 142.215.100.60
set security ike gateway gw1 external-interface ge-0/0/0
set security ike gateway gw1 version v2-only
set security ike gateway gw2 ike-policy ike_pol
set security ike gateway gw2 address HA_VPN_INTERFACE_ADDRESS_1
set security ike gateway gw2 local-identity inet 142.215.100.60
set security ike gateway gw2 external-interface ge-0/0/0
set security ike gateway gw2 version v2-only
Replace the following values:
HA_VPN_INTERFACE_ADDRESS_0 : the external IPv4 address of the first tunnel
interface on the HA VPN gateway
HA_VPN_INTERFACE_ADDRESS_1 : the external IPv4 address of the second tunnel
interface on the HA VPN gateway
SHARED_SECRET : the pre-shared key you configured for the
HA VPN tunnel
Configure IPsec proposal and IPsec policy. For example:
set security ipsec proposal ipsec_prop protocol esp
set security ipsec proposal ipsec_prop authentication-algorithm hmac-sha1-96
set security ipsec proposal ipsec_prop encryption-algorithm aes-256-cbc
set security ipsec proposal ipsec_prop lifetime-seconds 10800
Configure the IPsec VPN gateway configurations and bind them to the
tunnel interfaces. For example:
set security ipsec vpn vpn1 bind-interface st0.1
set security ipsec vpn vpn1 ike gateway gw1
set security ipsec vpn vpn1 ike ipsec-policy ipsec_pol
set security ipsec vpn vpn1 establish-tunnels immediately
set security ipsec vpn vpn2 bind-interface st0.2
set security ipsec vpn vpn2 ike gateway gw2
set security ipsec vpn vpn2 ike ipsec-policy ipsec_pol
set security ipsec vpn vpn2 establish-tunnels immediately
Create the policy statements that change the next hop for IPv6 peers to the IPv6
next hop addresses.
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 from family inet6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 then next-hop PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 then accept
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 from family inet6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 then next-hop PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 then accept
Replace the following values:
PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1 : the IPv6 next hop address
of the BGP peer for the first tunnel
PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2 : the IPv6 next hop address
of the BGP peer for the second tunnel
For example:
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 from family inet6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 then next-hop 2600:2d00:0:2::2
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 then accept
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 from family inet6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 then next-hop 2600:2d00:0:2::1:2
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 then accept
Configure BGP for IPv6 route exchange.
When configuring BGP, you must specify
include-mp-next-hop statements to send the next hop attribute to the peer.
Then you export the policy statement that you defined in the previous step
to change the next hop to the IPv6 address.

Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS
This section describes how to set up your Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS
device to support IPv4 and IPv6 traffic in your HA VPN tunnels.
PAN-OS supports the transport of IPv6 traffic over IPv4.
However, PAN-OS does not support dual-stack address families.
As a result, you must set up separate VPN tunnels that carry either IPv4 traffic
or IPv6 traffic.
Note: The following instructions reflect PAN-OS 9.1.
For more information about configuring PAN-OS devices for use with VPN, see
Palo Alto PAN OS VPN documentation .
Before you begin
In Google Cloud, set up two HA VPN gateways and four
HA VPN tunnels.
Two tunnels are for IPv6 traffic and two tunnels are for IPv4 traffic.
Create the HA VPN gateway and tunnels
for IPv4 traffic. Create the following:
One HA VPN gateway that uses the IPv4-only stack type
Two VPN tunnels that can carry IPv4 traffic
Create the HA VPN gateway and tunnels
for IPv6 traffic. Create the following:
One HA VPN gateway that uses the dual-stack
stack type
Two VPN tunnels that can carry IPv6 traffic
Enable IPv6 in the BGP sessions for the IPv6 tunnels
Record the external IPv4 addresses that Google Cloud assigns to each
HA VPN gateway interface.
Record the following configuration values for each tunnel:
The link-local IPv4 address of the BGP peer, which is the PAN-OS side of the
BGP session
The link-local IPv4 address of the Cloud Router used for BGP peering
The ASN you assigned to the BGP peer, which is your PAN-OS device
The ASN you assigned to the Cloud Router for your BGP sessions
The pre-shared key
For each IPv6 tunnel, also record the peerIpv6NexthopAddress , which is the
IPv6 next hop address assigned to the BGP peer. Google Cloud might have
automatically assigned this address for you, or you might have manually
specified the addresses when you created the VPN tunnel.
To find the details for your BGP session configuration,
see View BGP session configuration .
