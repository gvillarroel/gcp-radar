Connect HA VPN to AWS peer gateways
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
When configuring an HA VPN external VPN gateway to Amazon Web
Services (AWS), you can use either a transit gateway or a virtual private
gateway. Only the transit gateway supports equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing.
When enabled, ECMP equally distributes traffic across active tunnels. The
supported topology requires two AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections, A and B ,
each with two external IP addresses. This topology yields four external IP
addresses in AWS: A1 , A2 , B1 , and B2 .
Known issue: When configuring VPN tunnels to AWS, use the IKEv2 encryption
protocol and select fewer transform sets on the AWS side; otherwise, the
Cloud VPN tunnel can fail to rekey. For example, select a combination
of single Phase 1 and Phase 2 encryption algorithms, integrity algorithms, and
DH group numbers. This rekeying issue is caused by a large SA payload size for
the default set of AWS transform sets. This large payload size results in IP
fragmentation of IKE packets on the AWS side, which Cloud VPN does not
support.
Create HA VPN to AWS peer gateways
Configure the four AWS IP addresses as a single external HA VPN
gateway with FOUR_IPS_REDUNDANCY , where:
AWS IP 0 = A1
AWS IP 1 = A2
AWS IP 2 = B1
AWS IP 3 = B2
Create four tunnels on the HA VPN gateway to meet the 99.99% SLA by
using the following configuration:
HA VPN interface 0 to AWS interface 0
HA VPN interface 0 to AWS interface 1
HA VPN interface 1 to AWS interface 2
HA VPN interface 1 to AWS interface 3
Set up HA VPN with AWS:
In Google Cloud, create an HA VPN gateway and a Cloud Router in
the region that you want. This action creates two external IP addresses, one for each gateway
interface. Record the external IP addresses for use in the next step.
In AWS, create two customer gateways by using the following:
The Dynamic routing option
The Google ASN of the Cloud Router
The external IP addresses of the Google Cloud HA VPN gateway
interfaces 0 and 1
Complete the steps that correspond to the AWS VPN option that you are using:
Transit Gateway
Create a
transit gateway VPN attachment
for the first customer gateway ( interface 0 ), and use the Dynamic routing option.
Repeat the previous step for the second customer gateway ( interface 1 ).
Virtual Private Gateway
Create a Site-to-Site VPN connection
for the first customer gateway ( interface 0 ) by using the following:
A Target Gateway Type of Virtual Private Gateway
The Dynamic routing option
Repeat the previous step for the second customer gateway ( interface 1 ).
Download the AWS configuration files for both connections that you created. The files contain
information that you need during the next steps in this procedure, including pre-shared
authentication keys, outside tunnel IP addresses, and inside tunnel IP addresses.
In Google Cloud, do the following:
Create a new peer VPN gateway with four interfaces by using the
AWS external IP addresses from the files that you downloaded in the previous step.
Create four VPN tunnels on the HA VPN gateway that
you created in step 1. For each tunnel, configure the HA VPN
gateway interface with the appropriate peer VPN gateway interface and pre-shared keys
by using the information in the AWS configuration files that you downloaded.
Configure BGP sessions on the Cloud Router by using the BGP IP addresses from the
downloaded AWS configuration files.
Configure the external HA VPN gateway
Configure the four AWS IP addresses as a single external
HA VPN gateway with FOUR_IPS_REDUNDANCY , where:
AWS IP 0 = A1
AWS IP 1 = A2
AWS IP 2 = B1
AWS IP 3 = B2
Create four tunnels on the HA VPN gateway to meet the 99.99%
SLA by using the following configuration:
HA VPN interface 0 to AWS interface 0
HA VPN interface 0 to AWS interface 1
HA VPN interface 1 to AWS interface 2
HA VPN interface 1 to AWS interface 3

for the first customer gateway ( interface 0 ), and use the

Repeat the previous step for the second customer gateway ( interface

Virtual Private Gateway
Create a Site-to-Site VPN
connection
for the first customer gateway ( interface 0 ) by using the
following:
A Target Gateway Type of Virtual Private Gateway
The Dynamic routing option
Repeat the previous step for the second customer gateway ( interface
1 ).

Create four VPN tunnels on the HA VPN gateway that you
created in step 1. For each tunnel, configure the HA VPN
gateway interface with the appropriate peer VPN gateway interface and
pre-shared keys by using the information in the AWS configuration files
that you downloaded.
Configure BGP sessions on the Cloud Router by using the BGP IP
addresses from the downloaded AWS configuration files.
