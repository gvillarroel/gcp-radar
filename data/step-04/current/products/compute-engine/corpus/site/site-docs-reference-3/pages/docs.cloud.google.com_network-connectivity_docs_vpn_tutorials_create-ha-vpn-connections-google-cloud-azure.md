Create HA VPN connections between Google Cloud and Azure
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial demonstrates how to create highly available (HA) virtual private
network (VPN) connections between Google Cloud and Microsoft
Azure. You can use these HA VPN services for direct
communication between Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks in
Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure Virtual Network Gateways.
This document assumes that you're familiar with the basic concepts of
VPC networks, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), VPNs, and
Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) tunnels.
Google Cloud provides a
highly available (HA) VPN
service to connect your VPC network to environments running
outside of Google Cloud, such as Microsoft Azure, through an IPsec VPN
connection. An HA VPN provides a
service level agreement (SLA) of 99.99% service availability
when configured based on Google best practices.
Architecture overview
The following diagram shows the architecture that is described in this document.
The architecture shown in the diagram includes the following components:
Cloud Router : A fully distributed and managed Google Cloud
service to provide dynamic routing using BGP for your VPC
networks.
HA VPN gateway : A Google-managed VPN gateway
running on Google Cloud. Each HA VPN gateway is
a regional resource that has two interfaces: interface 0 and 1. Each of
these interfaces has its own external IP address.
VPN tunnels : Connections from the HA VPN gateway
on Google Cloud to the peer VPN gateway on Azure through which
encrypted traffic passes.
Virtual Network Gateway : Two private networks defined in the Azure Cloud
service.
Each Virtual Network Gateway connection comes with two tunnels that are
pre-configured to point to a single customer gateway, which in this case is an
HA VPN gateway interface in Google Cloud. With this
configuration, the minimum number of Cloud VPN tunnels required to meet the
99.99% service availability SLA is two.
IP addresses needed for the procedures
To complete the procedures in this document, you use a variety of IP addresses
in both Google Cloud and Azure. Some of these IP addresses are
automatically assigned when you create a resource.
For those addresses that are not automatically assigned, you define these IP
addresses based upon the IP addresses that you have available and the needs of
your organization.
Google Cloud resources require the following IP addresses:
Creating a subnet for a Virtual Private Cloud network requires a user-defined IP
address range.
After creating the HA VPN gateway, Google Cloud
automatically assigns two external IP addresses to the
HA VPN gateway. Google assigns one IP address to each of
the gateway's two interfaces. You need the IP addresses for these interfaces
to set up the local network gateways in Azure.
When you create HA VPN tunnels in Google Cloud,
each tunnel needs a BGP interface to the Cloud Router
and a BGP interface to the active-active virtual network gateway (VPN gateway)
in Azure. For each tunnel, decide on a pair of link-local BGP peering IPv4
addresses in a /30 block from the 169.254.21.* and 169.254.22.* ranges.
These ranges are the valid ranges for Azure APIPA BGP peering IPv4 addresses.
You must select four IP addresses in total.
The BGP peering IPv4 addresses that you select must be unique among all
Cloud Routers in all
regions of a VPC network.
Azure resources require the following IP addresses:
When you create the virtual network (VNet), the VNet requires an IP address
space for the network and an IP address space for the network's subnet. You can
use the default address spaces or enter user-defined address spaces.
When you create the active-active virtual network gateway (VPN gateway), the
gateway requires a subnet address range. You can use the default range or
enter a user-defined range.
When you configure the BGP for the active-active
VPN gateway, the gateway requires two APIPA BGP peering IP addresses. As
mentioned previously, the valid ranges for Azure APIPA BGP peering IP addresses
are 169.254.21.* and 169.254.22.* .
After you create an active-active VPN gateway, Azure automatically assigns
an external IP address to each of the gateway's interfaces. You need these IP
addresses to set up the peer VPN gateway in Google Cloud.
When defining IP addresses, make sure to use a unique set of IP addresses for each
network.
Objectives
Create an Azure virtual network (VNet) and an active-active virtual network
gateway (VPN gateway).
Create the necessary components on Google Cloud: a VPC
network, a Cloud Router, an HA VPN gateway,
a peer VPN gateway, and two HA VPN tunnels with BGP
sessions.
Create two local network gateways and two VPN connections in Azure. Verify
the Cloud Router configuration and check the status of your
HA VPN tunnels in Google Cloud.
Test the Cloud VPN connection between the VPC network
on Google Cloud and the virtual network (VNet) on Azure.

Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Compute Engine API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
Make sure that you have the
required administrative roles
to configure networking components:
Network Admin: compute.networkAdmin
Security Admin: compute.securityAdmin
Compute Admin: compute.admin
For more information about the purposes of these roles, see
IAM roles for networking-related job functions .
Create a VNet and an active-active VPN gateway on Azure
In Azure, you need to set up the following components:
An Azure virtual network (VNet) that allows Azure resources to communicate
with your Google Cloud VPN.
An active-active virtual network gateway (VPN gateway) that allows both
instances of the gateway's virtual machines (VMs) to establish VPN tunnels
to your Google Cloud VPN.
Create a VNet
A VNet lets Azure resources securely communicate with each other, the internet,
and other networks (such as Cloud VPN). For more information on creating a VNet,
see the Azure documentation on creating a
VNet .
Sign in to the Azure Portal.
In the Search resources, service, and docs (G+/) box,
type virtual network .
In the list of Marketplace results, select
Virtual network .
On the Virtual network page, select Create .
On the Basics tab of the Create virtual network page,
configure the following VNet settings for Project details
and Instance details :
In the Subscription box, verify that the subscription
that is
listed is the correct one. To change the subscription, select the subscription from the list .
To specify the resource group, click Create new to create
a new group and enter a name such as
azure‑to‑google‑resgroup for
the name of the resource group.
In the Name box, enter the name for your VNet such as
azure‑to‑google‑network .
In the Region box, select a location for your VNet.
The location that you select determines the storage location of the
resources that you deploy to this virtual network.
On the IP Addresses tab, in the IPv4 address space box, use the
default address space and subnet that was created by Azure.
On the Security tab, leave the values for BastionHost ,
DDos Protection Standard , and Firewall set to the default value of Disable .
To validate the VNet settings, select Review + create .
After the settings have been validated, select Create .
Create an active-active VPN gateway
The following procedures create the active-active VPN gateway:
The first procedure defines the project and instance details
The second procedure specifies the IP address for the gateway.
You only create the active-active VPN gateway at this time. You need to create
your Google Cloud components before you can configure the necessary tunnels in
Azure. For more information about creating an active-active VPN gateway, see the
Configure active-active VPN gateways using the portal
topic in the Azure documentation.
Define the gateway details
Sign in to the Azure Portal.
In Search resources, service, and docs (G+/) ,
type virtual network gateway .
Under Services in the search results, locate and select
Virtual network gateways .
On the Virtual network gateway page, select Create .
On the Basics tab of the Create virtual network gateway
page, specify the following values for options in the
Project details and Instance details sections:
In the Subscription list, select the subscription that you want to
use.
Optional: In the Gateway subnet address range box, enter the
address range for the subnet.
Verify that Resource Group displays the resource group that
corresponds to the virtual network that you select on this page.
For Name , enter the name of your gateway such as
azure‑to‑google‑gateway .
For Region , select the same region that you used to when you created
your VNET.
For Gateway type , select VPN .
For VPN type , select the Route-based VPN type.
In the SKU list, select the gateway SKU that you want to use.
The SKUs that are listed in the dropdown depend on the VPN type you select.
In the Generation list, select the generation that you want to use.
In the Virtual network list, select the VNet that you previously
created
Stay on this page for the next procedure.
Define the gateway IP addresses
On the Basics tab of the Create virtual network gateway page, use
the following steps to create the external IP addresses that are used by the
active-active VPN gateway:
For Public IP address , select Create new .
Azure automatically assigns the external IP address to your
active-active VPN gateway.
In the Public IP address name box, type a name for your external IP
address instance, such as
azure‑to‑google‑network‑ip1 .
For Enable active-active mode , select Enabled .
Optional: If available for your region, configure the Availability Zone .
For example, you can select Zone-redundant .
For Second Public IP Address , select Create new .
In the Public IP address name box, type the name of the second
external IP address, such as
azure‑to‑google‑network‑ip2 .
For Configure BGP , select Enabled .
For Autonomous system numbers (ASN) , set the ASN to an
allowable and valid value.
You use this ASN value when you set up the BGP sessions for the tunnels in
Google Cloud. Record this value as AZURE_ASN
to refer to this active-active VPN gateway.
For Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP address , enter the first APIPA BGP IP
address and record the value as AZURE_BGP_IP_0 .
The valid ranges for Azure APIPA BGP IP addresses are 169.254.21.* and
169.254.22.* .
For Second Custom Azure APIPA BGP IP address , enter the
second APIPA BGP IP address and record the value as
AZURE_BGP_IP_1 . You'll use these variables when
you configure the BGP sessions in Google Cloud.
To run validation, select Review + create .
After validation is complete, select Create to deploy the VPN gateway.
View and record the external IP addresses for the active-active VPN gateway
You need the external IP addresses that Azure automatically assigned to the
active-active VPN gateway. You use these IP addresses to create the peer VPN
gateway resource in Google Cloud.
On the Overview page for the active-active gateway that you just
created, locate the external IP addresses for the gateway.
Record the IP addresses that you see on the screen:
Record the first external IP address as AZURE_GW_IP_0 .
Record the second external IP address as AZURE_GW_IP_1 .
Later on, this document refers to these IP addresses as
AZURE_GW_IP_0 and AZURE_GW_IP_1 .
Create your Google Cloud components
On Google Cloud, you need to set up the following components:
A VPC network.
An HA VPN gateway.
A Cloud Router.
A peer VPN gateway.
HA VPN tunnels with BGP sessions.
The following procedures assume that you have set up Google Cloud as described
in Before you begin . If you haven't completed
those steps, do so now.
Create a VPC network, subnet, HA VPN gateway, and Cloud Router on Google Cloud
On Google Cloud, you create a VPC network, create an HA VPN gateway, create a
Cloud Router, and then configure the firewall rules on Google Cloud.
In Google Cloud Shell, make sure that you're working in the Cloud project
that you created or selected:
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
export PROJECT_ID = ` gcloud config list --format = "value(core.project)" `
Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your Cloud project ID.
Create a custom VPC network with a single subnet:
gcloud compute networks create NETWORK \
--subnet-mode SUBNET_MODE \
--bgp-routing-mode BGP_ROUTING_MODE
Replace the following:
NETWORK : The name of the network, such as
google‑to‑azure‑vpc .
SUBNET_MODE : The subnet
mode
set to custom .
BGP_ROUTING_MODE : The
BGP routing mode
set to global .
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute networks create google-to-azure-vpc \
--subnet-mode custom \
--bgp-routing-mode global
Create one subnet to host the test VMs:
gcloud compute networks subnets create SUBNET_NAME \
--network NETWORK \
--region SUBNET_REGION \
--range SUBNET_IP_ADDRESS_RANGE
Replace the following:
SUBNET_NAME : The subnet name.
SUBNET_REGION : The region in which to create the subnet.
SUBNET_IP_ADDRESS_RANGE : The
IP address range for the subnet .
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute networks subnets create subnet-central1 \
--network google-to-azure-vpc \
--region us-central1 \
--range 10.1.1.0/24
Create the HA VPN gateway:
gcloud compute vpn-gateways create HA_VPN_GATEWAY_NAME \
--network NETWORK \
--region REGION
Replace HA_VPN_GATEWAY_NAME with the name for the
HA VPN gateway.
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute vpn-gateways create ha-vpn-gw-a \
--network google-to-azure-vpc \
--region us-central1
The gateway that you create should look similar to the following example output:
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ YOUR_PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/vpnGateways/ha-vpn-gw-a].
NAME INTERFACE0 INTERFACE1 NETWORK REGION
ha-vpn-gw-a 203.0.113.1 203.0.113.2 google-to-azure-vpc us-central1
The output lists the external IPv4 addresses that have been
automatically assigned to each gateway interface
( INTERFACE0 and INTERFACE1 ). You need
these IP addresses when you set up the local network gateways
on Azure:
Record the IP address for INTERFACE0 in HA_VPN_INT_0 .
Record the IP address for INTERFACE1 in HA_VPN_INT_1 .
Create a Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers create ROUTER_NAME \
--region REGION \
--network NETWORK \
--asn GOOGLE_ASN \
Replace the following:
ROUTER_NAME : The name for your Cloud Router.
REGION : The region where you are creating the HA VPN gateway and tunnels.
GOOGLE_ASN : The private autonomous system number (ASN) for the Cloud Router that you're creating. It can be any
private ASN in the range 64512-65534 or 4200000000-4294967294 that you
aren't already using as a peer ASN in the same region and network.
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute routers create cloud-router \
--region us-central1 \
--network google-to-azure-vpc \
--asn 65534
Create a peer VPN gateway for the Azure VPN
In this section, you create an external VPN gateway resource that provides
information to Google Cloud about your active-active VPN gateway in Azure. You
create a single peer VPN gateway that uses two separate interfaces, each with
its own external IP address.
Create a single external peer VPN gateway with two interfaces:
gcloud compute external-vpn-gateways create AZURE_GW_NAME \
--interfaces 0 = AZURE_GW_IP_0 ,1 = AZURE_GW_IP_1
Replace the following:
AZURE_GW_NAME : the name of your Azure active-active
VPN gateway
AZURE_GW_IP_0 : the external IP address for one interface
from the peer gateway
AZURE_GW_IP_1 : the external IP address for another
interface from the peer gateway
The peer VPN gateway resource that you created should look similar to the
following example where AZURE_GW_IP_0 and
AZURE_GW_IP_1 show the actual external IP addresses of the peer
gateway interfaces:
gcloud compute external-vpn-gateways create azure-peer-gw \
--interfaces 0=203.0.113.1,1=203.0.113.2
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/global/externalVpnGateways/peer-gw].
NAME INTERFACE0 INTERFACE1
azure-peer-gw 203.0.113.1 203.0.113.2
Create VPN tunnels
You need to create two VPN tunnels: one tunnel for each interface in the peer
VPN gateway. When configuring VPN tunnels to Azure, use the IKEv2 encryption
protocol.
Note: The VPN tunnels that you create are not available until you have
finished creating the VPN connections in Azure.
For the commands used in this section, replace the following:
TUNNEL_NAME_IF0 and
TUNNEL_NAME_IF1 : a name for
the tunnel; naming the tunnels by including the gateway interface name can
help identify the tunnels later.
AZURE_GW_NAME : the name of the external peer gateway created
earlier
AZURE_GW_INT_NUM_0 and
AZURE_GW_INT_NUM_1 : the
interface numbers configured earlier on the external peer gateway.
IKE_VERS : use 2 for IKEv2.
SHARED_SECRET : your pre-shared key (shared secret),
which must correspond with the pre-shared key that you specify when you
set up VPN connections in Azure. For recommendations, see
Generate a strong pre-shared key .
HA_VPN_GATEWAY_NAME : the name of the HA VPN gateway.
INT_NUM_0 : the number 0 for the first interface on the
HA VPN gateway that you created earlier.
INT_NUM_1 : the number 1 for the second interface
on the HA VPN gateway that you created earlier.
Use the following steps to create the VPN tunnels:
Create the VPN tunnel for interface 0:
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create TUNNEL_NAME_IF0 \
--peer-external-gateway = AZURE_GW_NAME \
--peer-external-gateway-interface = AZURE_GW_INT_NUM_0 \
--region = REGION \
--ike-version = IKE_VERS \
--shared-secret = SHARED_SECRET \
--router = ROUTER_NAME \
--vpn-gateway = HA_VPN_GATEWAY_NAME \
--interface = INT_NUM_0
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create azure-tunnel-1 \
--peer-external-gateway azure-peer-gw \
--peer-external-gateway-interface 0 \
--region us-central1 \
--ike-version 2 \
--shared-secret xo2aTKHipD/oE1GAXgj3lMwjBmJXZjqD \
--router cloud-router \
--vpn-gateway ha-vpn-gw-a \
--interface 0
Create the VPN tunnel for interface 1:
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create TUNNEL_NAME_IF1 \
--peer-external-gateway = AZURE_GW_NAME \
--peer-external-gateway-interface = AZURE_GW_INT_NUM_1 \
--region = REGION \
--ike-version = IKE_VERS \
--shared-secret = SHARED_SECRET \
--router = ROUTER_NAME \
--vpn-gateway = HA_VPN_GATEWAY_NAME \
--interface = INT_NUM_1
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create azure-tunnel-2 \
--peer-external-gateway azure-peer-gw \
--peer-external-gateway-interface 1 \
--region us-central1 \
--ike-version 2 \
--shared-secret xo2aTKHipD/oE1GAXgj3lMwjBmJXZjqD \
--router cloud-router \
--vpn-gateway ha-vpn-gw-a \
--interface 1
Create BGP sessions
For dynamic routing, you use
Cloud Router
to establish BGP sessions between Google Cloud and Azure. We recommend
using dynamic routing instead of static routing whenever possible, as discussed
in the Cloud VPN Overview
and Cloud VPN Network and Tunnel Routing .
You need to create a BGP session for each VPN tunnel. Each BGP session consists
of a BGP interface to the Cloud Router and a BGP peer. You create a
BGP peer for each of the two VPN tunnels that you just created.
For the commands used in this section, replace the following:
ROUTER_NAME : the name you assigned to the Cloud Router.
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 and
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 :
the name for the Cloud Router BGP interface; it can be helpful to
use names related to the tunnel names configured previously.
MASK_LENGTH : specify 30 ; each BGP session on the same
Cloud Router must use a unique /30 CIDR from the 169.254.0.0/16
block.
GOOGLE_BGP_IP_0 and
GOOGLE_BGP_IP_1 : the BGP peering IP addresses for the HA VPN gateway interfaces that you
configure; each tunnel uses a different gateway interface. Because the allowed
ranges for Azure APIPA BGP peering IP addresses are 169.254.21.* and
169.254.22.* , you must select an available IP address in the /30 CIDR
of those ranges for your Cloud Router BGP peering IP addresses.
AZURE_BGP_IP_0 and AZURE_BGP_IP_1 :
the APIPA BGP peering IP addresses that you already configured on the Azure
active-active VPN gateway; each tunnel uses a different address.
TUNNEL_NAME_IF0 and TUNNEL_NAME_IF1 :
the tunnels associated with the HA VPN gateway interface
that you configured.
AZURE_ASN : the ASN that you configured for the
active-active peer VPN gateway in Azure.
BGP_PEER_NAME_1 and BGP_PEER_NAME_2
with unique names for each BGP peer.
For example, azure‑bgp‑peer‑1 and azure‑bgp‑peer‑2 .
To create BGP sessions for the VPN tunnels, follow these steps:
For the first VPN tunnel, add a BGP interface to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name = ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--mask-length = MASK_LENGTH \
--vpn-tunnel = TUNNEL_NAME_IF0 \
--ip-address = GOOGLE_BGP_IP_0 \
--region = REGION
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute routers add-interface cloud-router \
--interface-name azure-tunnel-1-int-0 \
--mask-length 30 \
--vpn-tunnel azure-tunnel-1 \
--ip-address 169.254.21.2 \
--region us-central1
For the first VPN tunnel, add a BGP peer to the interface:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name = BGP_PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn = AZURE_ASN \
--interface = ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--peer-ip-address = AZURE_BGP_IP_0 \
--region = REGION
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer cloud-router \
--peer-name azure-bgp-peer-1 \
--peer-asn 65515 \
--interface azure-tunnel-1-int-0 \
--peer-ip-address 169.254.21.1 \
--region us-central1
For the second VPN tunnel, add a BGP interface to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name = ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--mask-length = MASK_LENGTH \
--vpn-tunnel = TUNNEL_NAME_IF1 \
--ip-address = GOOGLE_BGP_IP_1 \
--region = REGION
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute routers add-interface cloud-router \
--interface-name azure-tunnel-2-int-1 \
--mask-length 30 \
--vpn-tunnel azure-tunnel-2 \
--ip-address 169.254.22.2 \
--region us-central1
For the second VPN tunnel, add a BGP peer to the interface:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name = BGP_PEER_NAME_2 \
--peer-asn = AZURE_ASN \
--interface = ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--peer-ip-address = AZURE_BGP_IP_1 \
--region = REGION
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer cloud-router \
--peer-name azure-bgp-peer-2 \
--peer-asn 65515 \
--interface azure-tunnel-2-int-1 \
--peer-ip-address 169.254.22.1 \
--region us-central1
Create local network gateways and VPN connections in Azure
With your Google Cloud components created and configured, you return to
your Azure environment to finish connecting Google Cloud to Azure.
To finish this connection, you create the following components in Azure:
Two local network gateways that represent your Google Cloud VPN in
Azure.
Two VPN connections that correspond to the two HA VPN
tunnels that you configured in Google Cloud.
Create two local network gateways
A local network gateway is a specific object that represents your Google
Cloud VPN in Azure.
When you create a local network gateway, you specify the following information:
A name for the local network gateway.
The IP address of the HA VPN interface to be used in the
connection.
The IP address of the Google Cloud Router to which you want to create
a connection.
The IP address prefixes that are routed through the VPN gateway to the
Cloud Router.
The address prefixes that you specify are the prefixes that are located on your
Cloud VPN.
If your Cloud virtual private network changes or you need to change the external
IP address for the Cloud Router, you can update the values later.
You need to create two local network gateways: one gateway that connects to the
first HA VPN tunnel interface on Google Cloud and
another gateway that connects to the second HA VPN tunnel
interface.
For more information, see the create a local network gateway section of the Create a site-to-site VPN connection in the Azure portal tutorial in the Azure documentation.
To create the first local network gateway, follow these steps:
Sign in to the Azure Portal.
In Search resources, service, and docs (G+/) , type local network gateway .
In the search results under Marketplace , locate and select local network gateway .
Click Create .
On the Basics tab of the Create local network gateway page, specify
the following values for your local network gateway:
In the Subscription list, verify that the correct subscription is showing.
In the Resource group list, select the same resource group as the one that you created for the VNet earlier in this document.
For Region , select the same location that your VNet resides in.
For Name , enter a name for your local network gateway, such as azure-to-google-locgateway1 .
For Endpoint , select IP address.
In the IP address box, enter the IP address for INTERFACE0 of your HA VPN (that is, enter HA_VPN_INT_0 ).
For Address Space, enter the address ranges for the network that this
local network represents.
You can add multiple address space ranges. Make sure that the ranges you
specify here do not overlap with ranges of other networks that you want
to connect to.
On the Advanced tab, configure the BGP settings as follows:
For Configure BGP settings , select Yes .
For Autonomous system number (ASN) , enter the ASN for your Cloud Router (that is, enter GOOGLE_ASN ).
For BGP peer IP address , enter the BGP IP address for the Cloud Router in tunnel 1 (that is, enter GOOGLE_BGP_IP_0 ).
To validate the local network gateway configuration, click Review and create at the bottom of the page.
After the validation passes, click Create to create the local network gateway.
To create the second local network gateway, follow these steps:
In the Azure Portal, in Search resources, service, and docs (G+/) , type
local network gateway .
Under Marketplace , in the search results, locate and select
local network gateway .
On the Basics tab of the Create local network gateway page, specify
the following values for your local network gateway:

For Configure BGP settings , select Yes .
For Autonomous system number (ASN) , enter the ASN for your Cloud Router (that is, enter GOOGLE_ASN ).
For BGP peer IP address , enter the BGP IP address for the Cloud Router in tunnel 1 (that is, enter GOOGLE_BGP_IP_1 ).
To validate your local network gateway configuration, click Review and create at the bottom of the page.
After the validation passes, click Create to create the local network gateway.
Create two VPN connections
To create the VPN connections in Azure, you need the preshared keys, or
SHARED_SECRET , that you configured when you set up the
HA VPN tunnels on Google Cloud.
In the Azure Portal, locate the active-active VPN gateway that you created in
Create an active-active VPN gateway .
Select Connections .
At the top of the Connections page, select +Add .
On the Add connection page, specify the following values for your first
connection:
For Name , enter a name for the connection, such as
azure-vnet-to-google1 .
For Connection type , select Site-to-site (IPsec) .
For Local network gateway , specify the first local network gateway
that you created, such as azure-to-google-locgateway1 .
For Shared key (PSK) , specify the shared key that you configured for
the first HA VPN tunnel.
Select Enable BGP .
For IKE Protocol , select IKEv2 .
Click OK .
On the Connections page, select +Add to add a second connection
with the following values:
For Name , enter a name for the connection, such as azure-vnet-to-google2 .
For Connection type , select Site-to-site (IPsec) .
For Local network gateway , specify the second local network gateway
that you created, such as azure-to-google-locgateway2 .
For Shared key (PSK) , specify the shared key that you configured for
the second HA VPN tunnel.
Select Enable BGP .
For IKE Protocol , select IKEv2 .
Click OK .
On the Connections page, verify that the status of both connections is
listed as Connected .
Verify the configuration
In Google Cloud, you can verify your HA VPN
configuration by first examining (listing) your Cloud Router
configuration and then checking the status of the HA VPN
tunnels.
In Cloud Shell, list the BGP peering IP addresses chosen by Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers get-status ROUTER_NAME \
--region = REGION \
--format = 'flattened(result.bgpPeerStatus[].name,
result.bgpPeerStatus[].ipAddress, result.bgpPeerStatus[].peerIpAddress)'
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute routers get-status cloud-router \
--region us-central1 \
--format='flattened(result.bgpPeerStatus[].name,result.bgpPeerStatus[].ipAddress,result.bgpPeerStatus[].peerIpAddress)'
The expected output for a Cloud Router managing two HA VPN tunnels (index 0 and index 1 ) should look like the following example:
result.bgpPeerStatus[0].ipAddress: 169.254.21.2
result.bgpPeerStatus[0].name: azure-bgp-peer-1
result.bgpPeerStatus[0].peerIpAddress: 169.254.21.1
result.bgpPeerStatus[1].ipAddress: 169.254.22.2
result.bgpPeerStatus[1].name: azure-bgp-peer-2
result.bgpPeerStatus[1].peerIpAddress: 169.254.22.1
In Cloud Shell, view the status of the first HA VPN tunnel:
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels describe TUNNEL_NAME_IF0 \
--region = REGION
Replace the following:
TUNNEL_NAME_IF0 : the tunnel associated with the first HA VPN gateway interface that you configured.
REGION : region where you deployed the HA VPN gateway.
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels describe azure-tunnel-1 -–region=us-central1
The expected output for the tunnel should look similar to the following example:
creationTimestamp: '2022-09-28T17:13:21.592-07:00'

Test connectivity
To test HA VPN connections, you first need to create VMs on each side of the tunnel.
Next, you need to make sure that you have firewall rules defined in Google Cloud that allow inbound ICMP traffic from the Azure network subnets. With the VMs and firewall rules in place, you can then test connectivity by using ping and test bandwidth by using iperf .
Create test VMs on each side of the tunnels to test ping requests.
You must also configure the Azure network firewall to allow inbound traffic from the subnet prefixes that are used in your Virtual Private Cloud.
On Google Cloud, configure a firewall rule that allows inbound ICMP traffic from your Azure VPN:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create RULE_NAME \
--network NETWORK \
--direction ingress \
--action allow \
--source-ranges AZURE_VNET_RANGE \
--rules icmp \
Replace AZURE_VNET_RANGE with the IP address range that is assigned to your Azure VNet.
The command should look similar to the following example:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-azure-icmp \
--network google-to-azure-vpc \
--direction ingress \
--action allow \
--source-ranges 10.0.0.0/16 \
--rules icmp
Test the connection using the ping command.
Measure bandwidth between your test machines using iperf .
Clean up
Delete the Google Cloud and Azure resources that you have created
during this tutorial.
Delete the Google Cloud project
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources
used in this tutorial, you can delete your project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Delete Azure resource group
Delete the Azure Manager resource group that you created when you created the
VNet. In this tutorial, the name of the example resource group
is azure-to-google-resgroup .
For more information, see
Azure Resource Manager resource group and resource deletion .
