Organization policies for Compute Engine
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Organization Policy Service provides centralized, programmatic
control over your organization's resources. You can use organization policies
to enforce constraints on how Compute Engine resources, such as virtual
machine (VM) instances, disks, and networks, are configured. For more
information about Organization Policy, see
Introduction to the Organization Policy Service .
You can set policies at the organization, folder, or project level.
Descendant resources inherit policies, which lets you enforce broad
controls at the organization level and apply more specific constraints at the
folder or project level.
This document provides an overview of how you can use Organization Policy to
manage your Compute Engine resources.
Use cases
You can use organization policies to enforce governance across your
Compute Engine resources. Common goals include:
Cost management : Control spending by restricting which VM machine types or
Persistent Disk sizes can be created in a given project.
Security posture : Enforce security best practices, such as requiring
OS Login for all VM instance access, or disabling the interactive serial console.
Compliance : Meet regulatory requirements such as requiring VMs in a
specific project to run on sole-tenant nodes to support hardware isolation.
Constraint types
When you use the Organization Policy, you can apply the following types of
constraints:
Managed constraints : Google-provided, predefined
constraints that are built on a modern platform, identifiable by the
compute.managed.* prefix. They support safe rollout tooling, such as
dry run and Policy Simulator, and tag-conditioned statements, which let
you grant granular exemptions to specific resources.
Managed constraints (legacy) : Google-provided, predefined constraints
identifiable by the compute.* prefix. While functional, they generally
lack support for modern safe rollout tools, such as Dry Run and Policy
Simulator, and don't support tag-conditioned statements. When an
equivalent alternative is available, we recommend migrating to managed
constraints to take advantage of enhanced governance and safe
rollout capabilities.
Custom constraints : Constraints that you create for your specific needs
using the Common Expression Language (CEL). Custom constraints let you
enforce policies on specific fields that are not addressed by managed
constraints. Like managed constraints, custom constraints support
tag-conditioned statements and safe rollout tools, such as Dry Run and
Policy Simulator. To learn more about creating and managing custom
constraints for Compute Engine, see
Custom constraints .
A limit of 20 constraints per Compute Engine resource applies to the total
number of managed constraints and custom constraints combined. Legacy managed
constraints don't count toward this limit.
Compute Engine constraints
The following sections list the Compute Engine constraints that Organization Policy supports.
Managed constraints
Managed constraints for Compute Engine simplify governance for
common security scenarios and integrate with safe rollout tools, such as dry-run
and Policy Simulator, which let you test their impact before enforcement. For a
list of managed constraints for Compute Engine, see
Managed constraints .
Managed constraints (legacy)
These constraints are from the previous generation and don't support safe
rollout tools. We recommend migrating to managed constraints when an
equivalent is available.

Constraint
Description
compute.allowedDeviceEncryptionKeys
Restricts the Cloud Key Management Service keys that can be used to encrypt device resources.
compute.disableAllIpv6
Disables creation of or update to subnet stacks of type IPV4_IPV6 but
does not affect existing IPV4_IPV6 stack type subnets. If this constraint
is active, any existing IPV4_IPV6 stack type subnetworks continue to
function. However, if there are IPV4_IPV6 stack type subnetworks in the
project when this constraint is activated, you must delete them before you
can create an IPV4_ONLY stack type subnetwork in the same region, even if
you are using a different VPC network.
compute.disableGuestAttributes
Disables Compute Engine guest attributes, which can be used to publish
hostnames, IP addresses, and other instance-related information from
within a virtual machine instance.
compute.disableInstanceDataAccessApis
Disables access to Compute Engine instance metadata APIs needed to access
sensitive instance metadata, such as sshKeys, serialPortLogging, and
startup-/shutdown-scripts.
compute.disableInternetNetworkEndpointGroup
Disables creation of Internet Network Endpoint Groups.
compute.disableNestedVirtualization
When set to true , disables hardware-accelerated nested virtualization for
all Compute Engine VMs in the project.
compute.disableSerialPortAccess
Disables serial port access to Compute Engine VMs.
compute.disableSerialPortLogging
Disables serial port logging to Google Cloud Observability from Compute Engine VMs.
compute.disableVpcExternalIpv6
If this constraint is active, you cannot create VPC networks with ULA
internal IPv6 ranges, or assign external IPv6 addresses to VMs in VPC
networks. This constraint does not affect internal IPv6 addresses in VPC
networks.
compute.enableComplianceMemoryProtection
Enables memory protection features on Compute Engine virtual machines.
compute.requireConfidentialVm
Requires that all new Compute Engine VM instances use Confidential VM.
compute.requireGuestAttributes
Requires Compute Engine guest attributes, which can be used to publish
hostnames, IP addresses, and other instance-related information from
within a virtual machine instance.
compute.requireOsLogin
Requires all new Compute Engine VM instances to enable OS Login.
compute.requireShieldedVm
Requires that all new VM instances are Shielded VMs.
compute.restrictCloudNATUsage
Restricts Cloud NAT usage to only specified VPC networks.
compute.restrictDedicatedInterconnectUsage
Restricts Dedicated Interconnect usage to only specified VPC networks.
compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes
Restricts creation of load balancers to only allowed types.
compute.restrictPartnerInterconnectUsage
Restricts Partner Interconnect usage to only specified VPC networks.
compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes
Restricts creation of protocol forwarding to internal or external target
instances.
compute.restrictSharedVpcHostProjects
Restricts the set of host projects that projects in scope can attach to.
compute.restrictSharedVpcSubnetworks
Restricts the set of Shared VPC subnetworks that projects in scope can use.
compute.restrictVpcPeering
Restricts VPC Network Peering to only allowed VPC networks.
compute.restrictVpnPeerIPs
Restricts VPN peer IPs to only allowed IPs.
compute.setNewProjectDefaultToZonalDnsOnly
When set to true , new projects default to Zonal DNS only; VMs created in
these projects have zonal DNS names ( .zone.c.project-id.internal ).
Projects for which Global DNS is disabled cannot be reverted to Global
DNS.
compute.skipDefaultNetworkCreation
Skips the automatic creation of the default VPC network and related
resources during Google Cloud Project creation.
compute.storageResourceUseRestrictions
Restricts the use of Compute Engine storage resources (such as PD-Standard,
PD-SSD, PD-Balanced, Local-SSD) based on location.
compute.trustedImageProjects
Restricts image access to only trusted images from the specified projects.
compute.vmCanIpForward
Restricts which VM instances can enable IP forwarding.
compute.vmExternalIpAccess
Restricts VM instances that are allowed to use external IP addresses.
