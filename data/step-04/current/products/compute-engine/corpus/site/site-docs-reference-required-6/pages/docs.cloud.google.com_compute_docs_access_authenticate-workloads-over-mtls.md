This document describes how to set up automatic provisioning and lifecycle
management of managed workload identities for Compute Engine. You
configure CA pools to issue certificates using
Certificate Authority Service (CA) ,
which is a highly-available, scalable Google Cloud service that simplifies and
automates the deployment, management, and security of CA services. Each VM
is provisioned with X.509 credentials from the configured CA pool. These
credentials can then be used to establish mTLS connections.
Before you begin
Review the
Managed workload identities overview
documentation.
Enable the Compute Engine API:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create VMs that use managed workload identity certificates
for authentication to other workloads,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on the project:
Compute Instance Admin (v1) ( roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1 )
Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Overview
With managed workload identities for Compute Engine, you can implement
mutually authenticated and encrypted communications between any two
Compute Engine VMs. Workload applications running on the configured VMs
can use the X.509 credentials for per-VM
mTLS . The
guest agent automatically rotates these mTLS
certificates and refreshes credentials on the VM.
By using managed workload identities, you can centrally administer identity for your
workloads. Compute Engine VMs can be authorized to receive a
workload identity that is based on key attributes, such as the instance ID,
instance name, or the attached service account. For the workloads to be
attested, the compute administrator or developer must create VM instances for
the workload with a matching instance name, instance ID, service account name,
or service account ID.
Managed workload identities conforms to the open source
Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone (SPIFFE) standard .
SPIFFE IDs for Google Cloud workloads are in the following format:
spiffe://< TRUST_DOMAIN /ns/ NAMESPACE /sa/ WORKLOAD_ID .
The TRUST_DOMAIN corresponds to an
Identity and Access Management (IAM) workload identity pool.
Managed workload identities are defined within a
workload identity pool ,
which acts as a top-level container to hold workload identities that have a
common trust boundary. Under a workload identity pool, identities are organized
into administrative boundaries called namespaces . For a workload to get a
managed identity, you must define attestation policies to authorize it. A
workload attestation policy ensures that only trusted workloads can assert a
managed identity.
To use managed workload identities for your applications, you must perform the
following tasks:
Security Administrator :
Create managed workload identities
in a workload identity pool.
Define the workload attestation policy .
Configure Certificate Authority Service to issue certificates for managed workload identities .
Authorize managed workload identities to request certificates from the CA pool .
Define the trust and certificate issuance configuration within the workload identity pool .
Compute Administrator :
Configure instances to use workload identities for
individual Compute Engine instances
Access workload credentials on a Linux instance .
Configure managed workload identities in Identity and Access Management
Follow the instructions in
Configure managed workload identities authentication .
These instructions detail how to complete the following:
Create a workload identity pool.
Create namespaces in the workload identity pool. You use the namespaces to
create administrative boundaries for your managed workload identities, for
example, a namespace for each of the applications owned by your
organization.
Create a managed workload identity in a namespace in the workload identity
pool. For example, you might create a namespace for an application and
create managed identities within that namespace for the microservices that
support that application.
Optional: Create a service account to create attestation rules based on
service account ID.
Create a workload attestation policy that allows your workload to be issued
credentials for the managed workload identity. Compute Engine VMs
can be authorized to receive a managed workload identity based on key
attributes such as the instance ID, instance name, or the attached service
account.
Configure Certificate Authority Service to issue certificates for
managed workload identities:
Configure the root CA pool
Configure the subordinate CAs
Authorize the managed workload identity pool to request certificates
from the CA pool
Enable managed workload identities for individual compute instances
You can enable managed workload identities for a compute instance either when creating
the instance or by updating the configuration for an existing instance.
Create instances with managed workload identities enabled
When you create a compute instance, to enable the managed workload identities feature
for the instance, you must do the following:
If the attestation of the instance for the workload identity is based on a
service account, then specify that service account
Include the --identity and --identity-certificate
flags
gcloud
Use the gcloud alpha compute instances create command
to create a new instance.
If you're using a service account for attestation, include the service
account information when creating the instance.
You can add additional lines to the command to configure the instance,
such as the machine type and image, instead of using the default values.
For more information, see
Create and start a VM instance .
gcloud alpha compute instances create INSTANCE_NAME \
--zone= INSTANCE_ZONE \
--service-account SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--identity=// TRUST_DOMAIN /ns/ NAMESPACE /sa/ WORKLOAD_IDENTIFIER \
--identity-certificate \
...
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_NAME : a unique name for the
instance. For details on valid instance names, see
Name resources .
INSTANCE_ZONE : the zone to create the
instance in.
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME : the name of the
service account that is allowed to receive the managed workload
identity.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project where the
service account was created.
TRUST_DOMAIN : the ID for the trust domain,
in the following format:
$ POOL_ID .global.$ PROJECT_NUMBER .workload.id.goog
The trust domain value uses the following placeholders:
POOL_ID : the name of the workload
identity pool
PROJECT_NUMBER : the project number for
the project in which the workload identity pool was created
NAMESPACE : the name of the namespace that
contains the workload attestation policy that authorizes the
workload to assert a managed workload identity
WORKLOAD_IDENTIFIER : the name of the
managed workload identity that was created in the namespace of the
workload identity pool
Enable managed workload identities on existing instances
To enable managed workload identities for an existing compute instance, update the
instance to configure the following:
If the attestation of the instance for the workload identity is based on a
service account and the instance doesn't already have an attached service
account, then create and attach a service account to the instance.
Enable the feature using the --identity-certificate flag and specify
which managed workload identity to use with the --identity flag.
Restart the VM.
gcloud
Use the gcloud alpha compute instances update command
to update the configuration for an instance.
If the instance doesn't already have an attached service account,
attach the service account to the instance .
Update the configuration for an existing instance to enable
managed workload identities.
gcloud alpha compute instances update INSTANCE_NAME \
--zone= ZONE \
--identity-certificate \
--identity=// TRUST_DOMAIN /ns/ NAMESPACE /sa/ WORKLOAD_IDENTIFIER
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_NAME : the instance name
ZONE : the zone where the instance is located
TRUST_DOMAIN : the ID for the trust domain, in the
following format:
none
$ POOL_ID .global.$ PROJECT_NUMBER .workload.id.goog
The trust domain value uses the following placeholders:
* POOL_ID : the name of the workload identity pool
* PROJECT_NUMBER : the project number for the project
in which the workload identity pool was created
+ NAMESPACE : the name of the namespace that contains
the workload attestation policy that authorizes the
workload to assert a managed workload identity
+ WORKLOAD_IDENTIFIER : the name of the managed workload
identity that was created in the namespace of the workload identity pool
Stop the VM.
gcloud alpha compute instances stop INSTANCE_NAME \
--zone= ZONE
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_NAME : the instance name
ZONE : the zone where the instance is located
Start the VM.
gcloud alpha compute instances start INSTANCE_NAME \
--zone= ZONE
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_NAME : the instance name
ZONE : the zone where the instance is located
Access workload credentials on a Linux VM
After you create and start a compute instance that uses managed workload identities,
the Google Cloud infrastructure (including the
Guest Agent ) automatically
provisions and manages the rotation of the credentials for the instance.
The workload certificates, including the private key and trust bundles, are
placed into a specific directory on the VM's file system:
/var/run/secrets/workload-spiffe-credentials . Applications can read the
certificates, private key and the trust bundle from the file system directly to
establish mTLS connections.
Note: Your application code must verify that the private key and certificate
file are consistent before using them to establish mTLS connection. A
mismatch between the private key and certificate can happen if the
Compute Engine guest agent refreshes the credentials from the metadata server
(MDS) in the time between the app reading the private key PEM file and the
certificates PEM file or the other way around. For example, apps written in
Golang can use the
tls.LoadX509KeyPair method
to check for consistency between the public and private key pair.
The Compute Engine guest agent on the guest OS runs a workload refresh
job and, if needed, creates the directory
/var/run/secrets/workload-spiffe-credentials . The directory
permissions are set to 0755 (rwxr-xr-x) .
The directory contains the following files created with 0644 (rw-r--r--)
permissions:
private_key.pem : a PEM-formatted private key
certificates.pem : a bundle of PEM-formatted X.509 certificates that
can be presented to other VMs as the client certificate chain, or used
as a server certificate chain.
ca_certificates.pem : a bundle of PEM-formatted X.509 certificates to
use as trust anchors when validating the certificates of peers.
Note: ca_certificates.pem contains certificates for the local SPIFFE
trust domain for the VM, which is:
spiffe:// POOL_ID .global. PROJECT_NUMBER .workload.id.goog
config_status : a log file containing error messages.
Refreshing the credentials and trust bundle
The Compute Engine control plane automatically rotates the managed workload
identity credentials and the trust anchors periodically.
If your applications use the file system to access the workload credentials and
trust bundle, the Compute Engine guest agent automatically refreshes the
credentials and the trust bundle, for example, when the mTLS certificates are
rotated.
Update certificate issuance and trust config
You can modify the certificate issuance config and trust config for a VM that
uses managed workload identities.
Caution: Updating the certificate issuance config and trust config for a
workload identity pool affects all VMs in the workload identity pool.
Update individual Compute Engine VMs
Note: Only the certificate issuance config and trust config values can be
updated. The managed workload identity cannot be changed after you create a
compute instance.
To update the certificate issuance config and trust config, you update the
workload identity pool. Use the
gcloud alpha iam workload-identity-pools update command ,
as shown in the following example:
gcloud alpha iam workload-identity-pools update WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POOL_ID \
--location="global" \
--inline-certificate-issuance-config-file= CIC_JSON_FILE_PATH \
--inline-trust-config-file= TC_JSON_FILE_PATH \
--project= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POOL_ID : The ID of the workload identity
pool.
CIC_JSON_FILE_PATH : The path to the new JSON-formatted
certificate issuance config file ( cic.json ).
TC_JSON_FILE_PATH : Optional: The path to the new
JSON-formatted trust config file ( tc.json ). If your workloads authenticate
across different trust domains, you must specify this file. Otherwise you
can omit the --inline-trust-config setting.
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project name.
