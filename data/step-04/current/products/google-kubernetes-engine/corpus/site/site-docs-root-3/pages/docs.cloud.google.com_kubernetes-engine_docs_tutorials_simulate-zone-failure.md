Standard
A common regulatory requirement is that a company can demonstrate their disaster
recovery (DR) capability. For applications that run in the cloud, this
requirement includes the reliability and availability of services when servers
hosted in one zone become unavailable for a period of time. This document is for
Admins and architects, Operators, and Backup and disaster recovery (DR) administrators
that want to learn how to simulate a zone failover when using a
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Standard regional cluster.
GKE regional clusters
are created in a user-chosen region, and run the control plane on VMs situated
in multiple zones within the chosen region. GKE
Autopilot clusters are always regional, and GKE
Standard clusters can be regional or zonal. This tutorial uses a
GKE Standard regional cluster. Cluster nodes communicate
with the control plane through a load balancer, which means that the node
location and the control plane VM location don't always match. In the
Google Cloud console, you can't disable a particular zone when you use a
regional cluster. For more information, see
GKE cluster architecture .
This tutorial provides three different methods for simulating zone failure. You
can simulate a zone failure and verify the correct application response using
whichever method is required for your own compliance purposes.
The methods in this document also apply to
zonal clusters ,
including single-zone and multi-zonal. These methods only affect the nodes in
targeted zones, and the GKE control plane isn't affected.
Objectives
Create a regional GKE Standard cluster using the
default configuration.
Deploy a sample microservices application to the regional cluster.
Simulate a zone outage using one of the following three methods:
Reduce the node pool's zones in a regional cluster.
Use a single-zone node pool.
Cordon and drain the target failure-zone's nodes.
Verify the microservices availability.

Create a regional Standard cluster
Before simulating a zone failure, create a regional cluster with a multi-zone
node pool. The cluster's control plane and nodes are replicated across multiple
zones in the specified region.
Use the Google Cloud CLI to create the cluster:
Create a new GKE Standard cluster using the default
configuration:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--location CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--num-nodes 2
Replace the following parameters:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name for your cluster.
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION : the Compute Engine
region of the control plane of your
cluster, such as us-central1 .
GKE takes a few minutes to create the cluster and verify
everything works correctly. Two nodes are created in each zone of the region
that you specify.
Check the zones of each node created in the previous step:
kubectl get node -o = custom-columns = 'NAME:.metadata.name,ZONE:.metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone,INT_IP:.status.addresses[0].address'
The output looks like the following example:
NAME ZONE INT_IP
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1 asia-southeast1-c 10.128.0.37
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node2 asia-southeast1-c 10.128.0.36
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node3 asia-southeast1-b 10.128.0.38
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node4 asia-southeast1-b 10.128.0.33
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node5 asia-southeast1-a 10.128.0.35
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node6 asia-southeast1-a 10.128.0.34
Connect to the cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--location CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Deploy a sample microservices application
To see the effect of the simulated failover in this document, deploy a sample
microservices-based application to your cluster. In this document, you use the
sample Cymbal Bank application :
In your shell, clone the following GitHub repository and change into the
directory:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos.git
cd bank-of-anthos/
Deploy the Cymbal Bank sample application to the GKE cluster
you created in the previous section:
kubectl apply -f ./extras/jwt/jwt-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes-manifests
Wait for the Pods to be ready:
kubectl get pods
After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a Running state:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
accounts-db-0 1 /1 Running 0 16s
balancereader-7dc7d9ff57-sstm5 0 /1 Running 0 15s
contacts-7ddc76d94-rr28x 0 /1 Running 0 14s
frontend-747b84bff4-2mtlv 0 /1 Running 0 13s
ledger-db-0 1 /1 Running 0 13s
ledgerwriter-f6cc7889d-9qjfg 0 /1 Running 0 13s
loadgenerator-57d4cb57cc-zqvqb 1 /1 Running 0 13s
transactionhistory-5dd7c7fd77-lwkv8 0 /1 Running 0 12s
userservice-cd5ddb4bb-wwhml 0 /1 Running 0 12s
When the Pods are all in a Running state, get the frontend Service
external IP address:
kubectl get service frontend | awk '{print $4}'
In a web browser window, open the IP address shown in the output of the
kubectl get service command to access your instance of Cymbal Bank.
The default credentials are automatically populated, so you can sign in to
the app and explore some of the sample transactions and balances. There are
no specific actions you need to take, other than to confirm that the Cymbal
Bank runs successfully. It might take a minute or two for all the Services
to correctly start and let you sign in. Wait until all the Pods are in a
Running state and you can successfully sign in to the Cymbal Bank site
before you move on to the next section and simulate a zone failure.
Simulate a zone failure
In this section, you simulate a failure with one of the zones. There are three
different ways you can simulate this failover. You only need to choose one
method. Simulate a zone failure and verify the correct application response
using whichever method is required for your own compliance purposes.
Note: If your applications contain stateful workloads, such as databases, make sure
that the data is stored in a detached Persistent Disk Volume and that read
replicas are deployed across multiple zones. Check this data storage before you
delete a node pool (simulate a zone failure), or consider using regional
Persistent Disk. For additional protection, you can also use
Backup for GKE .
StatefulSets data consistency, reliability, and mitigation strategy is outside
the scope of this document. If you don't consider these storage factors, there's
a risk of potential loss of data. Consult the documentation for your specific
database or stateful application, such as PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB,
Redis, or Cassandra to learn about their recommended high availability and
disaster recovery strategies.
Reduce node pool zones
By default, a node pool of a regional cluster has nodes that span across all
zones of its region. In the following diagram, Cloud Load Balancing distributes
traffic to a node pool that spans three zones. Each zone has two nodes, and your
Pods can run in nodes in any of these zones.
In this section, you simulate a zone failure by updating the node pool to only
run in two out of three zones. This approach verifies that your application can
respond to the loss of a zone by correctly redistributing Pods and traffic
across other zones.
To update the node pool to only run in certain zones and simulate failure,
complete the following steps:
Check the availability of regional cluster and Services:
kubectl get po -o wide \
kubectl get node -o = custom-columns = 'NAME:.metadata.name,ZONE:.metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone,INT_IP:.status.addresses[0].address'
The result is similar to the following example output:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE
accounts-db-0 1/1 Running 0 6m30s 10.28.1.5 regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node3

userservice-cd5ddb4bb-zfr2g 1/1 Running 0 6m28s 10.28.5.8 regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1
NAME ZONE INT_IP
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node5 asia-southeast1-c 10.148.0.6
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node6 asia-southeast1-c 10.148.0.7
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node2 asia-southeast1-a 10.148.0.8
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1 asia-southeast1-a 10.148.0.9
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node3 asia-southeast1-b 10.148.0.5
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node4 asia-southeast1-b 10.148.0.4
In this example, all the Cymbal Bank workloads are deployed in all zones. To
simulate a failure, you disable one of the zones, such as
asia-southeast1-c , where the frontend service is deployed.
Simulate a zone outage. Update the existing node pool ( default-pool ) to
only specify two zones out of the three zones:
gcloud container node-pools update default-pool \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--node-locations = ZONE_A, ZONE_B \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Replace ZONE_A, ZONE_B with the two zones where you
want the node pool to continue to running.
Verify microservices availability after you update the node pool:
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl get node -o = custom-columns = 'NAME:.metadata.name,ZONE:.metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone,INT_IP:.status.addresses[0].address'
The output should look like the following example:
NAME ZONE INT_IP
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node2 asia-southeast1-a 10.148.0.8
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1 asia-southeast1-a 10.148.0.9
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node3 asia-southeast1-b 10.148.0.5
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node4 asia-southeast1-b 10.148.0.4

loadgenerator-57d4cb57cc-7fvrc 1/1 Running 0 28m 10.28.4.7 regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node2

userservice-cd5ddb4bb-zfr2g 1/1 Running 0 28m 10.28.5.8 regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1
In this example output, asia-southeast1-c is no longer in use. The
frontend service you access from a browser with the URL http://EXTERNAL_IP
is still accessible. A user would still be able to do deposit and payment
actions, even though one of the zones is no longer available.
Use a single-zone node pool
In this section, you simulate a zone failure by deleting two of the node pools.
This approach verifies that your application can respond to the loss of a node
pool by correctly redistributing Pods and traffic across a node pool in another
zone. To simulate a zone outage on a regional cluster, you expand the basic
cluster previously created, running the Cymbal Bank application across multiple
node pools. This method of simulating the zone interruption more closely
reflects an actual zone failure than the first example of updating active zones
in a node pool, as it's more common for multiple node pools to exist in a
cluster:
The cluster that you build in this section to simulate a single-zone node pool
failure includes the following components:
Default node pool — usually created when you create a regional
GKE Standard cluster — that's a multi-zonal
node pool ( default-pool ).
This cluster with the single default-pool is what you created earlier in
this document.
Additional node pools ( zonal-node-pool-1 and zonal-node-pool-2 ) that
also run services for the example Cymbal Bank application.
The dotted lines in the diagram show how traffic only serves zonal-node-pool-2
after you simulate a failure in default-pool and zonal-node-pool-1 .
To create additional node pools and simulate failure, complete the following
steps:
Check availability of the regional cluster:
gcloud container node-pools list \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
kubectl get node -o = custom-columns = 'NAME:.metadata.name,ZONE:.metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone,INT_IP:.status.addresses[0].address'
The result is similar to the following example output:
NAME: default-pool
MACHINE_TYPE: e2-medium
DISK_SIZE_GB: 100
NODE_VERSION: 1.27.8-gke.1067004
NAME ZONE. INT_IP
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node5-pzmc asia-southeast1-c 10.148.0.6
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node6-qf1l asia-southeast1-c 10.148.0.7
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node2-dlk2 asia-southeast1-a 10.148.0.8
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1-pkfd asia-southeast1-a 10.148.0.9
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node3-6b6n asia-southeast1-b 10.148.0.5
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node4-h0lc asia-southeast1-b 10.148.0.4
In this example output, all Cymbal Bank Pods are deployed in all zones under
the same cluster and run in the existing default-pool .
Create two new single-zone node pools:
gcloud beta container node-pools create zonal-node-pool-1 \
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME \
--location CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--num-nodes 4 \
--node-locations ZONE_A
gcloud beta container node-pools create zonal-node-pool-2 \
--cluster CLUSTER_NAME \
--location CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--num-nodes 4 \
--node-locations ZONE_B
Replace ZONE_A and ZONE_B with the
two zones where you want the new single-zone node pools to run.
To simulate a zone failure, delete the default-pool regional node pool and
one of the new single-zone node pools:
gcloud container node-pools delete default-pool \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
gcloud container node-pools delete zonal-node-pool-1 \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
During the node-pool deletion process, workloads are shut down and
rescheduled to another available node pool. When this process happens, the
Services and Deployments aren't available. This behavior means that downtime
windows need to be specified for DR reporting or documentation.
Verify the continued availability of the microservices:
kubectl get po -o wide \
kubectl get node -o = custom-columns = 'NAME:.metadata.name,ZONE:.metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone,INT_IP:.status.addresses[0].address'
The output should look similar like the following example:
NAME ZONE INT_IP
regional-cluster-1-node-pool3-node1 asia-southeast1-b 10.148.0.8
regional-cluster-1-node-pool3-node2 asia-southeast1-b 10.148.0.9
regional-cluster-1-node-pool3-node3 asia-southeast1-b 10.148.0.5

userservice-cd5ddb4bb-zfr2g 1/1 Running 0 28m 10.28.5.8 regional-cluster-1-zonal-node-pool-2-node1
In this example output, as the default-pool and the zonal-node-pool-1 no
longer exist, all Services run in zonal-node-pool-2 .
Cordon and drain nodes in a zone
In this section, you cordon and drain specific nodes in your cluster. You cordon
and drain all the nodes in a single zone, which simulates the loss of the Pods
that run on those nodes across the zone:
In this diagram, you cordon and drain the nodes in the first zone. The nodes in
the other two zones continue to run. This approach verifies that your
application can respond to the loss of all of the nodes in a zone by correctly
redistributing Pods and traffic across nodes that run in other zones.
To cordon and drain the nodes in one of the zones, simulating failure, complete
the following steps:
Check availability of the regional cluster and Services. Look at the node
names of the target failure zone. You want to specify a zone where the
frontend Pods run:
kubectl get pods -o wide
The output should look like the following example:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE
accounts-db-0 1/1 Running 0 4m7s 10.96.4.4 regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node2
balancereader-7dc7d9ff57-lv4z7 1/1 Running 0 4m7s 10.96.1.5 regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1

ledgerwriter-f6cc7889d-4hqbm 1/1 Running 0 4m6s 10.96.0.12 regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node5
loadgenerator-57d4cb57cc-fmq52 1/1 Running 0 4m6s 10.96.4.6 regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node2
transactionhistory-5dd7c7fd77-72zpx 1/1 Running 0 4m6s 10.96.6.12 regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node3
userservice-cd5ddb4bb-b7862 1/1 Running 0 4m6s 10.96.1.6 regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1
Associate the Pods listed in the previous output with the node's zone:
kubectl get node -o = custom-columns = 'NAME:.metadata.name,ZONE:.metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone,INT_IP:.status.addresses[0].address'
The output should look like the following example:
NAME ZONE INT_IP
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1 asia-southeast1-b 10.148.0.41
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node2 asia-southeast1-b 10.148.0.42
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node3 asia-southeast1-a 10.148.0.37
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node4 asia-southeast1-a 10.148.0.38
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node5 asia-southeast1-c 10.148.0.40
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node6 asia-southeast1-c 10.148.0.39
In the previous example output, the frontend Pods are located in
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1 in zone asia-southeast1-b .
In the next step, you trace all nodes in zone asia-southeast1-b , which
in this example output are regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1 and
regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node2
Cordon and drain target nodes in one of the zones. In this example, that's
the two nodes in asia-southeast1-b :
kubectl drain regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node1 \
--delete-emptydir-data --ignore-daemonsets
kubectl drain regional-cluster-1-default-pool-node2 \
--delete-emptydir-data --ignore-daemonsets
This command marks the nodes as unschedulable, and simulates node failures.
Kubernetes reschedules Pods to other nodes in functioning zones.
Look at where the new frontend Pods and other example Cymbal Bank Pods that
were previously running on the node in the failure zone are now
rescheduled:
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl get node -o = custom-columns = 'NAME:.metadata.name,ZONE:.metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone,INT_IP:.status.addresses[0].address'
The output should look like the following example:

In this example output, there are no example Cymbal Bank Pods that run on
cordoned nodes, and all Pods only now run in the other two zones.
Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) on the nodes might block node draining. Assess
PDB policies before the cordon and drain action. To understand more about
PDB and its relation with managing disruption, see how to ensure reliability
and uptime for your GKE cluster.
Note: After you have simulated the failure, you can use kubectl uncordon
to allow Pods to be scheduled on the nodes again.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the
resources used in this tutorial:
Delete the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project you created for
the tutorial.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
