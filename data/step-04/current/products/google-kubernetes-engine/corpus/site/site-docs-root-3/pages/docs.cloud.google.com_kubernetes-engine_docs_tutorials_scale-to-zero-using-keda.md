Scale to zero using KEDA
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Standard
This tutorial shows how to scale your GKE workloads down to zero
Pods using KEDA . Scaling the deployments to zero Pods saves
resources during periods of inactivity (such as weekends and non-office hours),
or for intermittent workloads such as periodic jobs.
Objectives
This tutorial describes the following use cases:
Scale your Pub/Sub workload to zero :
Scale the number of Pods in proportion to the number of messages queued
on the Pub/Sub topic. When the queue is empty,
the workload automatically scales down to zero Pods.
Scale your LLM workload to zero .
Deploy your LLM model servers on nodes with GPU. When the service is
idle, the workload automatically scales down to zero Pods.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
GPU resources used by GKE
Pub/Sub
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .

When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell to
run commands. Cloud Shell is a shell environment for managing
resources hosted on Google Cloud. It comes preinstalled with the
Google Cloud CLI , kubectl ,
Helm and Terraform
command-line tools. If you don't use Cloud Shell, you must install the
Google Cloud CLI and Helm.
To run the commands on this page, set up the gcloud CLI in one of the following
development environments:
Cloud Shell
To use an online terminal with the gcloud CLI already set up, activate
Cloud Shell:
At the bottom of this page, a Cloud Shell session starts and displays a
command-line prompt. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Local shell
To use a local development environment, follow these steps:
Install the gcloud CLI.

Setting up your environment
Note: This tutorial assumes that your GKE cluster, Pub/Sub topic, and Pub/Sub subscription are all located in the same Google Cloud project.
To set up your environment with Cloud Shell, follow these steps:
Set environment variables:
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
export PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format 'get(projectNumber)' )
export LOCATION = LOCATION
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud
project ID
and LOCATION with the
regions or zones where your
GKE cluster should be created.
Note: For deploying an Ollama workload ,
choose a location that supports the g2-standard-4 machine type. For more
information, see
Available regions and zones .
If you don't follow the entire tutorial in a single session, or if your
environment variables are unset for some reason, make sure to run this
command again to set the variables again.
Create a Standard GKE cluster with
cluster autoscaling and
Workload Identity Federation for GKE
enabled:
gcloud container clusters create scale-to-zero \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID } --location = ${ LOCATION } \
--machine-type = n1-standard-2 \
--enable-autoscaling --min-nodes = 1 --max-nodes = 5 \
--workload-pool = ${ PROJECT_ID } .svc.id.goog
Install KEDA
KEDA is a component that complements Kubernetes Horizontal
Pod Autoscaler. With KEDA, you can scale a Deployment to zero Pods and up from
zero Pods to one Pod. A Deployment is a Kubernetes API object that lets you run multiple replicas of Pods that are distributed among the nodes in a cluster.. The standard
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler algorithm
applies after GKE creates at least one Pod.
After GKE scales the Deployment to zero Pods, because no Pods are
running, autoscaling cannot rely on Pod metrics such as CPU utilization. As a
consequence, KEDA allows fetching metrics originating from outside the cluster
using an implementation of the Kubernetes
External Metrics API .
You can use this API to autoscale based on metrics such as the number of
outstanding messages on a Pub/Sub subscription. See the
KEDA documentation for a list of all
supported metric sources.
Install KEDA on your cluster with Helm or with kubectl .
Helm
Run the following commands to add the KEDA Helm repository, install the KEDA
Helm chart, and give the KEDA service account read access to
Cloud Monitoring:
helm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.github.io/charts
helm repo update
helm install keda kedacore/keda --create-namespace --namespace keda
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding projects/ ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--role roles/monitoring.viewer \
--member = principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/ ${ PROJECT_NUMBER } /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ ${ PROJECT_ID } .svc.id.goog/subject/ns/keda/sa/keda-operator
Note that this command also sets up authorization rules that require the
cluster to be set up with Workload Identity Federation for GKE.
kubectl
Run the following commands to install KEDA using kubectl apply and to give
the KEDA service account read access to Cloud Monitoring:
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://github.com/kedacore/keda/releases/download/v2.15.1/keda-2.15.1.yaml
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding projects/ ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--role roles/monitoring.viewer \
--member = principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/ ${ PROJECT_NUMBER } /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ ${ PROJECT_ID } .svc.id.goog/subject/ns/keda/sa/keda-operator
Note that this command also sets up authorization rules that require the
cluster to be set up with Workload Identity Federation for GKE.
Confirm that all KEDA resources appear under the keda namespace:
kubectl get all -n keda
For more information about KEDA design and resources, see the
KEDA documentation .
Scale your Pub/Sub workload to zero
This section describes a workload that processes messages from a
Pub/Sub subscription, handling each message and acknowledging its
completion. The workload scales dynamically: as the number of unacknowledged
messages increases, autoscaling instantiates more Pods to ensure timely
processing.
Scaling to zero ensures that no Pods are instantiated when no messages have been
received for a while. This saves resources as no Pods stay idle for long periods
of time.
Deploy a Pub/Sub workload
Deploy a sample workload that processes messages queued on a Pub/Sub
topic. To simulate a realistic workload, this sample program waits three seconds
before acknowledging a message. The workload is configured to run under the
keda-pubsub-sa service account.
Run the following commands to create the Pub/Sub topic and subscription,
configure their permission, and create the Deployment starting the workload
under the keda-pubsub namespace.
gcloud pubsub topics create keda-echo
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create keda-echo-read --topic = keda-echo
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding projects/ ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--role = roles/pubsub.subscriber \
--member = principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/ ${ PROJECT_NUMBER } /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ ${ PROJECT_ID } .svc.id.goog/subject/ns/keda-pubsub/sa/keda-pubsub-sa
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/refs/heads/main/cost-optimization/gke-keda/cloud-pubsub/deployment/keda-pubsub-with-workload-identity.yaml
Configure scale-to-zero
To configure your Pub/Sub workload to scale to zero, use KEDA to
define a ScaledObject resource to specify how the deployment should scale.
KEDA will then automatically create and manage the underlying
HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) object.
Create the ScaledObject resource to describe the expected autoscaling behavior:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/refs/heads/main/cost-optimization/gke-keda/cloud-pubsub/deployment/keda-pubsub-scaledobject.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
This creates the following object:
apiVersion : keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind : ScaledObject
metadata :
name : keda-pubsub
namespace : keda-pubsub
spec :
maxReplicaCount : 5
scaleTargetRef :
name : keda-pubsub
triggers :
- type : gcp-pubsub
authenticationRef :
name : keda-auth
metadata :
subscriptionName : "projects/${PROJECT_ID}/subscriptions/keda-echo-read"
Inspect the HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) object that KEDA creates based on
the ScaledObject object:
kubectl get hpa keda-hpa-keda-pubsub -n keda-pubsub -o yaml
Note: Even if the minReplicas field is not set to zero, KEDA overrides it by
removing any Pods from the target Deployment when scaling to zero.
You can read more about autoscaling in the
Kubernetes documentation .
Wait until KEDA acknowledges that the Pub/Sub subscription is empty,
and scales the Deployment to zero replicas.
Inspect the workload autoscaler:
kubectl describe hpa keda-hpa-keda-pubsub -n keda-pubsub
Observe that in the command response, the ScalingActive condition is false.
The associated message shows that the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler acknowledges
that KEDA scaled the deployment to zero, at which point it stops operating
until the Deployment scales back up to one Pod.
Name : keda-hpa-keda-pubsub
Namespace : keda-pubsub
Metrics : ( current / target )
"s0-gcp-ps-projects-[...]]" (target average value) : 0 / 10

---- ------ ------ -------
AbleToScale True ScaleDownStabilized recent recommendations were higher than current one [...]
ScalingActive False ScalingDisabled scaling is disabled since the replica count of the target is zero
ScalingLimited True TooManyReplicas the desired replica count is more than the maximum replica count
Trigger the scale-up
To stimulate the Deployment to scale up:
Enqueue messages on the Pub/Sub topic:
for num in { 1 ..20 }
do
gcloud pubsub topics publish keda-echo --project = ${ PROJECT_ID } --message = "Test"
done
Verify that the Deployment is scaling up:
kubectl get deployments -n keda-pubsub
In the output, observe that the 'Ready' column shows one replica:
NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE
keda-pubsub 1/1 1 1 2d
KEDA scales up the Deployment after it observes that the queue is not empty.
Scale your LLM workload to zero
This section describes a Large Language Model (LLM) workload that deploys an Ollama server
with attached GPU. Ollama allows running popular LLMs such as
Gemma and
Llama 2 , and exposes its features primarily through HTTP.
Install KEDA-HTTP add-on
Scaling an HTTP service down to zero Pods during periods of inactivity causes
request failures, since there's no backend to handle the requests.
This section shows how to solve this problem using the KEDA-HTTP add-on.
KEDA-HTTP starts an HTTP proxy that receives user requests and forwards them to
the Services configured to scale-to-zero. When the Service has no Pod, the proxy
triggers the Service to scale up, and buffers the request until the Service
has scaled up to at least one Pod.
Caution: KEDA-HTTP is in beta.
Install the KEDA-HTTP add-on using Helm. For more information, refer to
KEDA-HTTP documentation .
helm repo add ollama-helm https://otwld.github.io/ollama-helm/
helm repo update
# Set the proxy timeout to 120s, giving Ollama time to start.
helm install http-add-on kedacore/keda-add-ons-http \
--create-namespace --namespace keda \
--set interceptor.responseHeaderTimeout = 120s
Deploy an Ollama LLM workload
To deploy an Ollama LLM workload:
Create a node pool containing g2-standard-4 nodes with attached GPUs, and configure cluster autoscaling
to provide between zero and two nodes:
gcloud container node-pools create gpu --machine-type = g2-standard-4 \
--location = ${ LOCATION } --cluster = scale-to-zero \
--min-nodes 0 --max-nodes 2 --num-nodes = 1 --enable-autoscaling
Note: Your location must support the g2-standard-4 machine type. For more
information, see
Available regions and zones .
Add the official Ollama Helm chart repository, and update your local Helm
client's repository:
helm repo add ollama-helm https://otwld.github.io/ollama-helm/
helm repo update
Deploy the Ollama server using the Helm chart:
helm install ollama ollama-helm/ollama --create-namespace --namespace ollama \
-f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/refs/heads/main/cost-optimization/gke-keda/ollama/helm-values-ollama.yaml
The helm-values-ollama.yaml configuration specifies the LLM models to load,
the GPU requirements, and the TCP port for the Ollama server.
Configure scale-to-zero
To configure your Ollama workload to scale to zero, KEDA-HTTP uses an
HTTPScaledObject .
Create the HTTPScaledObject resource to describe the expected autoscaling behavior:
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/refs/heads/main/cost-optimization/gke-keda/ollama/keda-ollama-httpscaledobject.yaml
This creates the HTTPScaledObject object that defines the following
fields:
scaleTargetRef : specifies the Service to which KEDA-HTTP should forward
the requests. In this example, all requests with the host ollama.ollama
are routed to the Ollama server.
scaledownPeriod : specifies (in seconds) how fast to scale down when no
requests are received.
replicas : specifies the minimum and maximum number of Pods to maintain
for the Ollama deployment.
scalingMetric : specifies the metrics used to drive autoscaling, such as
request rate in this example. For more metric options, see the
KEDA-HTTP documentation .
kind : HTTPScaledObject
apiVersion : http.keda.sh/v1alpha1
metadata :
namespace : ollama
name : ollama
spec :
hosts :
- ollama.ollama
scaleTargetRef :
name : ollama
kind : Deployment
apiVersion : apps/v1
service : ollama
port : 11434
replicas :
min : 0
max : 2
scaledownPeriod : 3600
scalingMetric :
requestRate :
targetValue : 20
Run the following command to verify that KEDA-HTTP has successfully processed
the HTTPScaledObject created in the previous step:
kubectl get hpa,scaledobject -n ollama
The output shows the HorizontalPodAutoscaler (created by KEDA), and the
ScaledObject (created by KEDA-HTTP) resources:
NAME REFERENCE TARGETS MINPODS MAXPODS REPLICAS AGE
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/keda-hpa-ollama Deployment/ollama 0/100 (avg) 1 2 1 2d
NAME SCALETARGETKIND SCALETARGETNAME MIN MAX TRIGGERS AUTHENTICATION READY ACTIVE FALLBACK PAUSED AGE
scaledobject.keda.sh/ollama apps/v1.Deployment ollama 0 2 external-push True False False Unknown 2d
Verify that the Deployment scales down to zero Pods.
Wait the period of time set in the scaledownPeriod field and run the
command:
kubectl get deployments -n ollama
The output shows that KEDA scaled down the Ollama deployment, and that no Pods
are running:
NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE
ollama 0/0 0 0 2d
Trigger the scale-up
To stimulate the Deployment to scale up, call the Ollama service using the proxy
set up by the KEDA-HTTP add-on. This causes the value of the request rate
metric to increase, and triggers the creation of a first Pod.
Use kubectl port forwarding capabilities to access the proxy because the proxy
is not exposed externally.
kubectl port-forward svc/keda-add-ons-http-interceptor-proxy -n keda 8080 :8080 &
# Set the 'Host' HTTP header so that the proxy routes requests to the Ollama server.
curl -H "Host: ollama.ollama" \
http://localhost:8080/api/generate \
-d '{ "model": "gemma:7b", "prompt": "Hello!" }'
The curl command sends the prompt "Hello!" to a Gemma model. Observe
the answer tokens coming back in the response. For the specification of the API,
see the Ollama guide .
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Clean up the Pub/Sub subscription and topic:
gcloud pubsub subscriptions delete keda-echo-read
gcloud pubsub topics delete keda-echo
Delete your GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete scale-to-zero --location = ${ LOCATION }
