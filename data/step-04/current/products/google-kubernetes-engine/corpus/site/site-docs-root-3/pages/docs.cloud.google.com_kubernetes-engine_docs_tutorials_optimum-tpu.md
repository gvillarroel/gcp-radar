Standard
This tutorial shows you how to serve
large language model (LLM) open source models , using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) on
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with the Optimum TPU
serving framework from Hugging Face . In this tutorial,
you download open source models from Hugging Face and deploy the models on a GKE Standard
cluster using a container that runs Optimum TPU.
This guide provides a starting point if you need the granular control, scalability,
resilience, portability, and cost-effectiveness of managed Kubernetes when
deploying and serving your AI/ML workloads.
This tutorial is intended for Generative AI customers in the Hugging Face ecosystem, new or
existing users of GKE, ML Engineers, MLOps (DevOps) engineers, or
platform administrators who are interested in using Kubernetes container
orchestration capabilities for serving LLMs.
Google Cloud products like GKE, Vertex AI, and
Compute Engine support various serving libraries, such as JetStream,
vLLM, and other partner offerings. For example, you can use JetStream to get the
latest optimizations from the project. If you prefer Hugging Face options, you
can use Optimum TPU.
Optimum TPU supports the following features:
Continuous batching
Token streaming
Greedy search and multinomial sampling using transformers.
Objectives
Prepare a GKE Standard cluster
with the recommended TPU topology based on the model characteristics.
Deploy Optimum TPU on GKE.
Use Optimum TPU to serve the supported models through curl.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
If you're using an existing project for this guide,
verify that you have
the permissions required to complete this guide . If you created a new
project, then you already have the required permissions.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the required API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .

Create a Hugging Face account, if you don't already have one.
Ensure your project has sufficient quota for
Cloud TPU in GKE.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to configure clusters and workloads,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on the project:
Service Account Admin ( roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin )
Manage GKE clusters:
Kubernetes Engine Admin ( roles/container.admin )
Build and push images to Artifact Registry:
Artifact Registry Administrator ( roles/artifactregistry.admin )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Prepare the environment
In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell to manage resources hosted on
Google Cloud. Cloud Shell comes preinstalled with the software you'll need
for this tutorial, including
kubectl and
gcloud CLI .
To set up your environment with Cloud Shell, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Set the default environment variables:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
export PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get project )
export CLUSTER_NAME = CLUSTER_NAME
export REGION = REGION_NAME
export ZONE = ZONE
export HF_TOKEN = HF_TOKEN
Replace the following values:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID .
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your GKE cluster.
REGION_NAME : the region where your GKE
cluster, Cloud Storage bucket, and TPU nodes are located. The region
contains zones where TPU v5e machine types are available (for example, us-west1 , us-west4 , us-central1 , us-east1 , us-east5 , or europe-west4 ).
(Standard cluster only) ZONE : the zone where the TPU resources are available (for example, us-west4-a ). For Autopilot clusters, you don't need to specify the
zone, only the region.
HF_TOKEN : your HuggingFace token.
Clone the Optimum TPU repository:
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-tpu.git
Get access to the model
You can use the Gemma 2B or Llama3 8B models. This tutorial focuses on these two models, but Optimum TPU supports more models.
Gemma 2B
To get access to the Gemma models for deployment to
GKE, you must first sign the license consent agreement then generate a
Hugging Face access token.
Sign the license consent agreement
You must sign the consent agreement to use Gemma. Follow these instructions:
Access the model consent page .
Verify consent using your Hugging Face account.
Accept the model terms.
Generate an access token
Generate a new Hugging Face token if you don't already have one:
Click Your Profile > Settings > Access Tokens .
Click New Token .
Specify a Name of your choice and a Role of at least Read .
Click Generate a token .
Copy the generated token to your clipboard.
Llama3 8B
You must sign the consent agreement to use Llama3 8b in the Hugging Face Repo
Generate an access token
Generate a new Hugging Face token if you don't already have one:
Click Your Profile > Settings > Access Tokens .
Select New Token .
Specify a Name of your choice and a Role of at least Read .
Select Generate a token .
Copy the generated token to your clipboard.
Create a GKE cluster
Create a GKE Standard cluster with 1 CPU node:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--num-nodes = 1 \
--location = REGION_NAME
Create TPU node pool
Create a v5e TPU node pool with 1 node and 8 chips:
gcloud container node-pools create tpunodepool \
--location = REGION_NAME \
--num-nodes = 1 \
--machine-type = ct5lp-hightpu-8t \
--node-locations = ZONE \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME
If TPU resources are available, GKE provisions the node pool. If
TPU resources are temporarily unavailable, the output shows a GCE_STOCKOUT
error message. To troubleshoot resource availability errors, refer to
Insufficient TPU resources to satisfy the TPU request .
Build the container
Run the make command to build the image
cd optimum-tpu && make tpu-tgi
Push the image to the Artifact Registry
gcloud artifacts repositories create optimum-tpu --repository-format = docker --location = REGION_NAME && \
gcloud auth configure-docker REGION_NAME -docker.pkg.dev && \
docker image tag huggingface/optimum-tpu REGION_NAME -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID /optimum-tpu/tgi-tpu:latest && \
docker push REGION_NAME -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID /optimum-tpu/tgi-tpu:latest
Create a Kubernetes Secret for Hugging Face credentials
Create a Kubernetes Secret that contains the Hugging Face token:
kubectl create secret generic hf-secret \
--from-literal = hf_api_token = ${ HF_TOKEN } \
--dry-run = client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
Deploy Optimum TPU
To deploy Optimum TPU, this tutorial uses a Kubernetes Deployment. A Deployment is a Kubernetes API object that lets you run multiple replicas of Pods that are distributed among the nodes in a cluster..

Make sure the model is fully downloaded before proceeding to the next section.
Serve the model
Set up port forwarding to the model:
kubectl port-forward svc/service 8080 :8080
Interact with the model server using curl
Verify your deployed models:
In a new terminal session, use curl to chat with the model:
curl 127 .0.0.1:8080/generate -X POST -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?","parameters":{"max_new_tokens":40}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
The output should be similar to the following:
{"generated_text":"\n\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data.\n\nArtificial neural networks are inspired by the way the human brain works. They are made up of multiple layers"}
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the deployed resources
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources
that you created in this guide, run the following command:
