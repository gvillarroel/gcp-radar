Standard
This guide demonstrates how to deploy and serve a Stable Diffusion model on
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using TPUs,
Ray Serve ,
and the
Ray Operator add-on .
This guide is intended for Generative AI customers, new or existing users of
GKE, ML Engineers, MLOps (DevOps) engineers, or platform
administrators who are interested in using Kubernetes container orchestration
capabilities for serving models using Ray.
About Ray and Ray Serve
Ray is an open-source scalable compute framework for AI/ML applications. Ray
Serve is a model serving library for Ray used for scaling and serving models in
a distributed environment. For more information, see
Ray Serve in the Ray
documentation.
About TPUs
Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are specialized hardware accelerators designed to
significantly speed up the training and inference of large-scale machine
learning models. Using Ray with TPUs lets you seamlessly scale high-performance
ML applications. For more information about TPUs, see
Introduction to Cloud TPU in the Cloud TPU
documentation.
About the KubeRay TPU initialization webhook
As part of the Ray Operator add-on, GKE provides validating and
mutating
webhooks
that handle TPU Pod scheduling and certain TPU environment variables required
by frameworks like
JAX for container initialization. The KubeRay
TPU webhook mutates Pods with the app.kubernetes.io/name: kuberay label
requesting TPUs with the following properties:
TPU_WORKER_ID : A unique integer for each worker Pod in the TPU slice.
TPU_WORKER_HOSTNAMES : A list of DNS hostnames for all TPU workers that need
to communicate with each other within the slice. This variable is only
injected for TPU Pods in a multi-host group.
replicaIndex : A Pod label that contains a unique identifier for the
worker-group replica the Pod belongs to. This is useful for multi-host worker
groups, where multiple worker Pods might belong to the same replica, and is
used by Ray to enable multi-host autoscaling.
TPU_NAME : A string representing the GKE TPU PodSlice this Pod
belongs to, set to the same value as the replicaIndex label.
podAffinity : Ensures GKE schedules TPU Pods with matching
replicaIndex labels on the same node pool. This lets GKE
scale multi-host TPUs atomically by node pools, rather than single nodes.
Objectives
Create a GKE cluster with a TPU node pool.
Deploy a Ray cluster with TPUs.
Deploy a
RayService
custom resource.
Interact with the Stable Diffusion model server.

Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:

Ensure sufficient quota
Ensure that your Google Cloud project has sufficient TPU quota in your
Compute Engine region or zone. For more information, see
Ensure sufficient TPU and GKE quotas
in the Cloud TPU documentation. You might also need to increase your
quotas for:
Persistent Disk SSD (GB)
In-use IP addresses
Prepare your environment
To prepare your environment, follow these steps:
Launch a Cloud Shell session from the Google Cloud console, by
clicking
Activate Cloud Shell in the
Google Cloud console .
This launches a session in the bottom pane of the Google Cloud console.
Set environment variables:
export PROJECT_ID= PROJECT_ID
export CLUSTER_NAME=ray-cluster
export COMPUTE_REGION=us-central2-b
export CLUSTER_VERSION= CLUSTER_VERSION
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud
project ID .
CLUSTER_VERSION : the GKE version to
use. Must be 1.30.1 or later.
Clone the GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
Change to the working directory:
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/ai-ml/gke-ray/rayserve/stable-diffusion
Create a cluster with a TPU node pool
Create a
Standard
GKE cluster with a TPU node pool:
Create a Standard mode cluster with the Ray Operator enabled:
gcloud container clusters create ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--addons = RayOperator \
--machine-type = n1-standard-8 \
--cluster-version = ${ CLUSTER_VERSION } \
--location = ${ COMPUTE_REGION }
Create a single-host TPU node pool:
gcloud container node-pools create tpu-pool \
--location = ${ COMPUTE_REGION } \
--cluster = ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--machine-type = ct4p-hightpu-4t \
--num-nodes = 1
To use TPUs with Standard mode, you must select:
A Compute Engine location with capacity for TPU accelerators
A compatible machine type for the TPU and
The physical topology of the TPU PodSlice
Configure a RayCluster resource with TPUs
Configure your RayCluster manifest to prepare your TPU workload:
Configure TPU nodeSelector
GKE uses Kubernetes
nodeSelectors
to ensure that TPU workloads are scheduled on the appropriate TPU topology and accelerator. For more information about selecting TPU nodeSelectors, see
Deploy TPU workloads in GKE Standard .
Update the ray-cluster.yaml manifest to schedule your Pod on a v4 TPU podslice
with a 2x2x1 topology:
nodeSelector:
cloud.google.com/gke-tpu-accelerator: tpu-v4-podslice
cloud.google.com/gke-tpu-topology: 2x2x1
Configure a TPU container resource
To use a TPU accelerator, you must specify the number of TPU chips that
GKE should allocate to each Pod by configuring the
google.com/tpu resource limits and requests in the TPU container field
of your RayCluster manifest workerGroupSpecs .
Update the ray-cluster.yaml manifest with resource limits and requests:
resources:
limits:
cpu: "1"
ephemeral-storage: 10Gi
google.com/tpu: "4"
memory: "2G"
requests:
cpu: "1"
ephemeral-storage: 10Gi
google.com/tpu: "4"
memory: "2G"
Configure worker group numOfHosts
KubeRay v1.1.0 adds a numOfHosts field to the RayCluster custom resource,
which specifies the number of TPU hosts to create per worker group replica.
For multi-host worker groups, replicas are treated as PodSlices rather than
individual workers, with numOfHosts worker nodes being created per replica.
Update the ray-cluster.yaml manifest with the following:
workerGroupSpecs:
# Several lines omitted
numOfHosts: 1 # the number of "hosts" or workers per replica
Create a RayService custom resource

This manifest describes a RayService custom resource that creates a
RayCluster resource with 1 head node and a TPU worker group with a 2x2x1
topology, meaning each worker node will have 4 v4 TPU chips.
The TPU node belongs to a single v4 TPU podslice with a 2x2x1 topology. To
create a multi-host worker group, replace the gke-tpu nodeSelector values,
google.com/tpu container limits and requests, and numOfHosts values with
your multi-host configuration. For more information about TPU multi-host
topologies, see
System architecture in the
Cloud TPU documentation.
Apply the manifest to your cluster:
kubectl apply -f ray-service-tpu.yaml
Verify the RayService resource is running:
kubectl get rayservices
The output is similar to the following:
NAME SERVICE STATUS NUM SERVE ENDPOINTS
stable-diffusion-tpu Running 2
In this output, Running in the SERVICE STATUS column indicates the
RayService resource is ready.
(Optional) View the Ray Dashboard
You can view your Ray Serve deployment and relevant logs from the Ray Dashboard.
Establish a port-forwarding session to the Ray dashboard from the Ray head
service:
kubectl port-forward svc/stable-diffusion-tpu-head-svc 8265 :8265
In a web browser, go to http://localhost:8265/ .
Click the Serve tab.
Send prompts to the model server
Establish a port-forwarding session to the Serve endpoint from the Ray head
service:
kubectl port-forward svc/stable-diffusion-tpu-serve-svc 8000
Open a new Cloud Shell session.
Submit a text-to-image prompt to the Stable Diffusion model server:
python stable_diffusion_tpu_req.py --save_pictures
The results of the stable diffusion inference are saved to a file named diffusion_results.png .
Observe your Ray workloads
To view details for your RayJobs, you can navigate to the Kubernetes Engine > AI/ML > Jobs
section in Google Cloud console.

Clean up
Delete the project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete individual resources
To delete the cluster, type:
gcloud container clusters delete ${ CLUSTER_NAME }
