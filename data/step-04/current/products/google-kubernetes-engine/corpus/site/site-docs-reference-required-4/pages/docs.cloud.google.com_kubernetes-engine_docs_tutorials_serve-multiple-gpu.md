Autopilot
Standard
This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy and serve a large language model (LLM)
using multiple GPUs on GKE for efficient and scalable inference.
You create a GKE cluster that uses multiple L4 GPUs and you
prepare infrastructure to serve any of the following models:
Llama 3 70b
Mixtral 8x7b
Falcon 40b
Depending on the data format of the model, the required number of GPUs varies.
In this tutorial, each model uses two L4 GPUs. To learn more, see
Calculating the amount of GPUs .
This tutorial is intended for Machine learning (ML) engineers,
Platform admins and operators, and for Data and AI specialists who are interested
in using Kubernetes container orchestration capabilities for serving LLMs. To
learn more about common roles and example tasks referenced in Google Cloud
content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Before reading this page, ensure that you're familiar with the following:
Autopilot mode and Standard mode
Current GPU version availability
GPUs in GKE
Objectives
In this tutorial, you:
Create a cluster and node pools.
Prepare your workload.
Deploy your workload.
Interact with the LLM interface.
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure that you have performed the following tasks:
Enable
the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
Enable Google Kubernetes Engine API
If you want to use the Google Cloud CLI for this task,
install and then
initialize the
gcloud CLI. If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest
version by running the gcloud components update command. Earlier gcloud CLI versions might not support running the commands in this document.
Note: For existing gcloud CLI
installations, make sure to set the compute/region property . If you use primarily zonal clusters, set the compute/zone instead. By setting a default location,
you can avoid errors in the gcloud CLI like the following:
One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location . You might need to specify the location in certain commands if the location of your cluster differs from the default that you set.
Some models have additional requirements. Ensure you meet these requirements:
To access models from Hugging Face, use a HuggingFace token .
For the Mixtral 8x7b model - accept the conditions for the Mistral Mixtral model .
For the Llama 3 70b model - make sure you have an active license for the
Meta Llama models .
Warning: Getting access and approval for the Llama model might take up to
three days.
Prepare your environment
In the Google Cloud console, start a Cloud Shell instance:
Open Cloud Shell
Set the default environment variables:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set billing/quota_project PROJECT_ID
export PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get project )
export CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION = us-central1
Replace the PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud
project ID .
Note: If your Cloud Shell instance disconnects throughout the tutorial
execution, repeat the preceding step.
Create a GKE cluster and node pool
You can serve LLMs on GPUs in a GKE Autopilot
or Standard cluster. We recommend that you use a Autopilot
cluster for a fully managed Kubernetes experience. To choose the GKE mode of operation that's the best fit for your workloads, see Choose a GKE mode of operation .
Autopilot
In Cloud Shell, run the following command:
gcloud container clusters create-auto l4-demo \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--location = ${ CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION } \
--release-channel = rapid
GKE creates an Autopilot cluster with CPU and GPU
nodes as requested by the deployed workloads.
Configure kubectl to communicate with your cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials l4-demo --location = ${ CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION }
Standard
In Cloud Shell, run the following command to create a Standard cluster
that uses Workload Identity Federation for GKE :
gcloud container clusters create l4-demo \
--location ${ CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION } \
--workload-pool ${ PROJECT_ID } .svc.id.goog \
--enable-image-streaming \
--node-locations = ${ CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION } -a \
--workload-pool = ${ PROJECT_ID } .svc.id.goog \
--machine-type n2d-standard-4 \
--num-nodes 1 --min-nodes 1 --max-nodes 5 \
--release-channel = rapid
Note: The --node-locations flag might have to be adjusted based on which
region you choose. Check which
zones the L4 GPUs are available if you change
the us-central1 region.
The cluster creation might take several minutes.
Run the following command to create a
node pool for your cluster:
gcloud container node-pools create g2-standard-24 --cluster l4-demo \
--location ${ CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION } \
--accelerator type = nvidia-l4,count = 2 ,gpu-driver-version = latest \
--machine-type g2-standard-24 \
--enable-autoscaling --enable-image-streaming \
--num-nodes = 0 --min-nodes = 0 --max-nodes = 3 \
--node-locations ${ CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION } -a, ${ CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION } -c \
--spot
GKE creates the following resources for the LLM:
A public Standard cluster.
A node pool with g2-standard-24 machine type scaled down to 0 nodes.
You aren't charged for any GPUs until you launch Pods that request GPUs. This node pool provisions Spot VMs , which are priced lower than the default standard Compute Engine
VMs and provide no guarantee of availability. You can remove the --spot flag
from this command, and the cloud.google.com/gke-spot node selector in
the text-generation-inference.yaml config to use on-demand VMs.
Configure kubectl to communicate with your cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials l4-demo --location = ${ CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION }
Prepare your workload
This section shows how to set up your workload depending on the model
you want to use. This tutorial uses Kubernetes Deployments to deploy the model.
A Deployment is a Kubernetes API object that lets you run multiple replicas of Pods that are distributed among the nodes in a cluster..
Llama 3 70b
Set the default environment variables:
export HF_TOKEN = HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN
Replace the HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN with your
HuggingFace token.
Create a
Kubernetes secret
for the HuggingFace token:
kubectl create secret generic l4-demo \
--from-literal = HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN = ${ HF_TOKEN } \
--dry-run = client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

Success: At this point, you have deployed an LLM using L4 GPUs in
GKE.
Calculate the amount of GPUs
The amount of GPUs depends on the value of the QUANTIZE flag. In this
tutorial, QUANTIZE is set to bitsandbytes-nf4 , which means that the model is
loaded in 4 bits.
A 70 billion parameter model would require a minimum of 40 GB of GPU memory
which equals to 70 billion times 4 bits (70 billion x 4 bits= 35 GB) and
considers a 5 GB of overhead. In this case, a single L4 GPU wouldn't have enough
memory. Therefore, the examples in this tutorial use two L4 GPU of memory (2 x
24 = 48 GB). This configuration is sufficient for running Falcon
40b or Llama 3 70b in L4 GPUs.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the cluster
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources
that you created in this guide, delete the GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete l4-demo --location ${ CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION }
