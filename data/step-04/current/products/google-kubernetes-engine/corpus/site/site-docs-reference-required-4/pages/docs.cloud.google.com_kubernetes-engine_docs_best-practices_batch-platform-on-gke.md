This page introduces the best practices for building and optimizing batch processing platforms with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), including best practices for:
Architecture
Job management
Multi-tenancy
Security
Queueing
Storage
Performance
Cost efficiency
Monitoring
GKE provides a powerful framework for orchestrating batch
workloads such as data processing,
training machine learning models ,
running scientific simulations ,
and other high performance computing workloads .
These best practices are intended for platform administrators, cloud architects, and
operations professionals interested in deploying batch workloads in
GKE. The Reference Architecture: Batch Processing Platform on GKE showcases many of the best practices discussed in this guide, and can be deployed in your own Google Cloud project.
How batch workloads work
A batch workload is a group of tasks that run to completion without user
intervention. To define tasks, you use the Kubernetes
Jobs resource.
A batch platform receives the Jobs and queues them in the
order they are received. The queue in the batch platform applies processing
logic such as priority, quota, and allocable resources. By queueing and
customizing the batch processing parameters, Kubernetes lets you optimize the
use of available resources, minimize the idle time for scheduled Jobs, and
maximize cost savings. The following diagram shows the
GKE components that can be part of a batch platform.
Batch platform management
Traditionally, batch platforms have two main user personas, developers and
platform administrators:
A developer submits a Job specifying the program, the
data to be processed, and requirements for the Job. Then, the developer receives
confirmation of the Job submission and a unique identifier. Once the Job is
complete, the developer would get a notification along with any output or
results of the Job.
A platform administrator manages and delivers an efficient and reliable batch
processing platform to the developers.
A batch processing platform must meet the following requirements:
The platform resources are properly provisioned to ensure that Jobs run
with little to no user intervention required.
The platform resources are configured according to the organization's
security and observability best practices.
The platform resources are used as efficiently as possible. In case of
resource contention, the most important work gets done first.
Prepare the batch platform architecture in GKE
A GKE environment consists of nodes, which are Compute Engine
virtual machines (VMs), that are grouped together to form a cluster.
The following table lists the key recommendations when planning and designing
your batch platform architecture:
Recommendation
Resources
Select a GKE mode of operation
GKE has the following modes of operation available:
With Autopilot mode, GKE
automatically manages your cluster configuration, including your nodes, scaling,
security, and other preconfigured settings so you can focus on your workload.
Autopilot clusters are highly-available by default.
With Standard mode, you define and manage your cluster
configuration, including your nodes, scaling, security, and other advanced
settings.
See the high-level comparison between Autopilot and
Standard mode .
Choose the machine type for your nodes
GKE supports the following Compute Engine VMs series:
Cost-optimized, such as E2
Balanced, such as N2, N2D, or N1
Scale-out optimized, such as Tau T2D, or Tau T2A
Memory-optimized, such as M2 or M1
Compute-optimized, such as C2 or C2D
Accelerator-optimized, such as A4 featuring NVIDIA B200 GPUs
Each machine series is associated
with one or more CPU platforms, such as Arm processors and x86 processors from
Intel and AMD.
Learn about the options that are currently available for your workload .
Use hardware accelerators for your nodes
You can also use hardware accelerators such as graphics processing
units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in GKE.
Consider is GPU time-sharing strategy, which allows multiple containers
to share time on the same physical GPU. This approach is useful for
burstable and homogenous GPU workloads with low requests. Multi-instance
GPUs to partition GPUs to share a single GPU resource across multiple
containers at the same time.
Learn about the available GPU
accelerator strategies, such as Time-sharing
and Multi-instance
GPUs .
Learn about TPUs accelerator
strategies .
Enable cluster autoscaler on Standard clusters
GKE automatically
resizes the number of nodes in a given node pool based on the
demands of your workloads. You don't need to manually add or remove
nodes or over-provision your node pools. Instead, you only specify a
minimum and maximum size for the node pool.
We recommend you set
cluster autoscaler with the following configuration:
Use
optimize-utilization profile that removes unused nodes up
to three times faster than the balanced profile. To learn
more, see Autoscaling
profiles .
Set location policy to ANY . The
GKE cluster autoscaler prioritizes utilization of unused
reservations and create nodes in any available zone in the regions. To
learn more, see Location
policy .
Enable node auto-provisioning to automatically manage
and autoscale your infrastructure. Once a node pool is created using
auto-provisioning, cluster autoscaler can dynamically scale the
nodepool. To learn more, see How
node auto-provisioning works .
With Autopilot clusters, you don't need to worry about provisioning nodes or managing node pools because node pools are automatically provisioned through node auto-provisioning, and are automatically scaled to meet the requirements of your workloads.
Enroll your cluster in a release channel
GKE
can automatically manage your cluster version and upgrades. Based on your
release adoption model, you can enroll your cluster in the
GKE available channels.
To learn more, see How
to choose the best release channel for your clusters
Define a scope of maintenance to exclude for your cluster
With a upgrade scope exclusion window defined, GKE
respects that long running batch workloads aren't disrupted for
maintenance until completion. To learn more, see Scope of maintenance to exclude .
Manage the Job lifecycle
In Kubernetes, you run your workloads in a set of
Pods . Pods
are groups of single or multiple containers, with shared storage and network
resources. Pods are defined by a Kubernetes specification.
A Job creates one or more Pods and continually tries to run them until a
specified number of Pods successfully terminate. As Pods complete, the Job
tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful
completions is reached, the Job is complete.
The following table lists the key recommendations when designing and managing
Jobs:
Recommendation
Resources
Select the Job completion mode
Specify the Completion
mode as Indexed . This configuration is useful when assigning
a partition of the data to be processed based on the Pod's index. The Pods
of a Job get an associated completion index. Deleting a Job cleans up
the Pods it created. Suspending a Job deletes its active Pods until the
Job is resumed again.
Set CronJobs for regular scheduled actions
Use CronJob for GKE to perform regular scheduled actions, such as backups, report generation, or scheduled training for machine learning models.
Manage failures in a Job Define the Kubernetes Pod failure
policy and Pod backoff failure limit to handle retriable and non-retriable
failures in a Job. This definition improves the cluster resources
consumption by avoiding unnecessary Pod retries and Job failures due to
Pod disruptions. For example, you can configure preemption ,
API-initiated
eviction , or taint-based
eviction where Pods that don't have a toleration for the
NoExecute taint effect are evicted. Learn how to Handle
retriable and non-retriable pod failures with Pod failure policy .
Manage multiple Jobs as a unit Use the JobSet API to manage
multiple Jobs as a unit to address workload patterns, such as one driver
(or coordinator) and multiple workers (for example, MPIJob ) while setting
Job defaults that are aligned with common patterns based on your use
cases. For example, you can create an Indexed Job by default, create a
headless service for predictable fully qualified domain names (FQDN) for
Pods, and set the associated Pod failure policy.
Extend run time for a Pod that doesn't tolerate restarts
Set
the Kubernetes cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict
annotation to false in the Pod specification. The cluster
autoscaler respects the eviction rules set on Pods. These restrictions can
prevent a node from being deleted by the autoscaler if it contains a Pod with the
cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict annotation.
To learn more, see Considering Pod scheduling and disruption .
Manage Multi-tenancy
GKE cluster
multi-tenancy is an
alternative to managing
GKE resources by different users or workloads, named as
tenants , in a single
organization. The management of GKE resources might follow
criteria such as tenant isolation, quotas and limit ranges , or cost allocation.
The following table lists the key recommendations when managing multi-tenancy:
Recommendation
Resources
Use namespaces to manage tenant isolation You can separate
each tenant and their Kubernetes resources into their own namespaces .
Use policies to enforce tenant isolation Define Policies to
restrict API access, set quotas, constrain resource usage, and restrict
what containers are allowed to do. These policies are scoped by
namespaces.
Set GKE cost allocation Use GKE
cost allocation get insights about cluster resource requests for each
tenant on a namespace basis.
Control access to the batch platform
GKE allows you to finely tune the access permissions of the
workloads running on the cluster.
The following table lists the key recommendations when managing access and security
Recommendation
Resources
Set Workload Identity Federation for GKE
GKE allows workloads in your GKE cluster to
impersonate Identity and Access Management (IAM) service accounts to access
Google Cloud services. By using Workload Identity Federation for GKE, workloads can securely access
secrets stored outside GKE.
To learn more, see
Workload Identity Federation for GKE and access
secrets stored .
Set cluster network isolation
Configure the network isolation of your clusters so that both the control plane endpoint and worker
nodes can have internal IP addresses.
To learn more, see About customizing network isolation .
Use Shielded GKE Nodes
Configure Shielded GKE Nodes to provide strong, verifiable node identity and integrity to increase the security of GKE nodes.
Physical isolation
For security reasons your workloads might
need stronger isolation.
Control scheduling with node taints to physically separate tenants in
node pools using node taints and workload tolerations. This helps ensure
that only the appropriate workloads are scheduled on those node
pools.
Queueing and fair sharing
To control resource consumption, you can assign resource quota limits
for each tenant, queue incoming Jobs, and process Jobs in the order they were
received.
The following table lists the key recommendations when managing queueing and
fair sharing among batch workloads:
Recommendation
Resources
Use Kueue
Kueue is a kubernetes-native Job queueing system for batch, high performance
computing, machine learning, and similar applications in a Kubernetes cluster. To
help with fair sharing of cluster resources between its tenants, Kueue manages
quotas and how Jobs consume them. Kueue makes the following decisions:
When a Job should wait
When a Job should be admitted to start, for example by creating the Pod
When a Job should be preempted, for example by deleting the Pod
To learn how to implement a Job queueing system, see Implement a Job queuing system with quota sharing between namespaces on GKE .
To learn more about Kueue, see Kueue concepts .
Optimize storage, performance, and cost efficiency
The efficient use of our GKE compute and storage resources can reduce costs.
One strategy is to right-size and configure your compute instances to align with your batch
processing needs while not sacrificing performance.
The following table lists the key recommendations when designing and managing
storage and optimizing performance:
Recommendation
Resources
Use Compute Engine Persistent Disks
We recommend you use
the following Compute Engine Persistent Disks configurations:
Use Regional
persistent disks to allow worker nodes in all zones in a region to
access the same underlying durable storage.
For workloads that require high-performance storage, use Local SSDs for ephemeral data, or Extreme Persistent Disk for persistent data.
Use Hyperdisk Throughput
Persistent Disk to independently and dynamically provision throughput
and capacity optimized for batch workloads.
Use network-attached storage
Use
the following network-attached storage alongside Persistent Disk for optimal storage performance:
Use Filestore to allow all worker nodes in a Pod to
access the same storage namespace and scale capacity .
Use Cloud Storage FUSE
to access Cloud Storage directly from a container as a local POSIX mount.
Define Pub/Sub Your batch workload may also read
and write data. For example, you can use Pub/Sub and write the results to
a data warehouse such as BigQuery from where
reports and dashboards are updated.
We recommend you use the
following storage solutions:
For managed object storage, use
Cloud Storage .
For managed
network file storage, use Filestore .
For workloads that require file-system semantics, use Cloud Storage FUSE
CSI driver . This driver allows Kubernetes applications to mount
Cloud Storage buckets as local file systems
Specify tuning parameters for your workload We recommend
you use the following configurations:
Customize your node
system configuration for your workload. For example, set the minimum,
default, and maximum values of the TCP socket receive buffer. Use node
system configuration .
Enable busy polling using network
profiles. Some workloads that are sensitive to network latency might be
improved. Use network profiles.
Increase network bandwidth for
GKE nodes by enabling Google Virtual NIC
(gVNIC) , a virtual network interface designed specifically for
Compute Engine recommended for high performance applications.
Specify the number of threads per core to disable Simultaneous
multi-threading .
Optimize your workloads networking and latency
GKE supports compact placement policy for node pools
which specifies that these nodes (and thus the workloads running on them)
should be placed in closer physical proximity to each other within a zone.
This is especially useful for tightly coupled and high performance
workloads where low latency between different processes comprising the
workload is a major concern. To learn more, see compact
placement .
Use Spot VMs Spot VMs are
Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances that are priced
lower than standard Compute Engine VMs and provide no guarantee of
availability.
We recommend you use the following solutions:
Set autoscaling Spot VMs node pools combined with location_policy=
"ANY" . With this policy, Spot VMs have a lower risk
of being preempted. This combination is especially useful for workloads
that can survive the preemption of individual worker nodes, such as
pleasingly parallel computations.
If your workload has a predictable
resource footprint, combine Google Cloud
Reservations and committed use
discounts may yield significant savings. Create a node pool with its
size set to the number of reserved instances and prioritize saturating
this node pool for maximum usage.
Use image steaming
Use Image
streaming to pull container images. GKE streams data
from eligible images. This allows your workloads to initialize without
waiting for the entire image to download, leading to significantly
improved initialization times and better cost efficiency.
Monitor clusters
GKE is integrated with observability and logging tools that help
you monitor the reliability and efficiency of your cluster. The following table
lists the key recommendations when enabling and using GKE
observability tools:
Recommendation
Resources
Use Prometheus
GKE is integrated with
Google Cloud Observability. Customize the metrics that you want GKE to
send to Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus is enabled for
GKE clusters by default. We
recommend that you use managed collection to eliminate the complexity of
setting up and maintaining Prometheus servers.
To learn more, see
Managed Service for Prometheus .
Use Cloud Monitoring dashboards
Use the Monitoring dashboards for GKE
to see a high level overview of cluster and resource
utilization and drill down and filter through various
metrics and dimensions.
To learn more, see Observing
your GKE clusters .
Observe your AI/ML workloads in Google Cloud console
In Google Cloud console, navigate to Kubernetes Engine > AI/ML > Jobs
to view your JobSets, Jobs, PyTorchJobs, and RayJobs. You can access details
such as logs, events, and visualizations in observability dashboards.
To view child Jobs inside a JobSet or workers belonging to a RayJob,
in the user interface, navigate to the parent resource.
