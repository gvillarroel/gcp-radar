Autopilot
Standard
This tutorial shows you how to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) using
Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with JAX.
Fine-tuning lets you adapt a foundation model like Gemma 3 to a
specific domain or task. This process improves the precision and accuracy of the
model by updating its parameters with your own specialized dataset.
This guide is a good starting point if you need the granular control,
customization, scalability, resilience, portability, and cost-effectiveness of
managed Kubernetes when fine-tuning your AI/ML workloads.
Background
By using TPUs on GKE with Jax to fine-tune an LLM, you can build a
robust, production-ready fine-tuning solution with all the benefits of managed
Kubernetes.
Gemma
Gemma is a set of openly
available, lightweight, generative AI/ML multimodal
models released under an open license. These AI models are available to run in
your applications, hardware, mobile devices, or hosted services.
Gemma 3 introduces multimodality, and it supports vision-language
input and text outputs. It handles context windows of up to 128,000 tokens and
supports over 140 languages. Gemma 3 also offers improved math,
reasoning, and chat capabilities, including structured outputs and function
calling.
You can use the Gemma models for text generation, or you can also
tune these models for specialized tasks.
For more information, see the Gemma
documentation .
TPUs
TPUs are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that Google
custom-developed to accelerate machine learning and AI models that are built
using frameworks such as TensorFlow ,
PyTorch , and JAX .
Before you use TPUs in GKE, we recommend that you complete the
following learning path:
Learn about current TPU version availability with the Cloud TPU system
architecture .
Learn about TPUs in
GKE .
JAX
JAX is a high-performance machine learning
framework that is designed to be used with TPUs and GPUs. JAX provides an API
for building and training machine learning models.
To learn more, see the JAX repository .
Objectives
This tutorial covers the following steps:
Create a GKE Autopilot or Standard cluster
with the recommended TPU topology, based on the model characteristics.
During this tutorial, you perform the fine-tuning on single-host node pools.
Add data to a Cloud Storage bucket and mount it to the container through
Cloud Storage FUSE.
Deploy the LLM fine-tuning Job on GKE.
Monitor the fine-tuning Job and view the logs.

Ensure that you have sufficient quota for 16 TPU Trillium (v6e)
chips. In this tutorial, you use a node pool configuration that requires 16 chips and on-demand
instances .
Ensure that you have a Docker repository. If you don't have one,
create a standard repository in
Artifact Registry.
Prepare the environment
In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell to
manage resources hosted on Google Cloud. Cloud Shell comes
preinstalled with the software you need for this tutorial, including
kubectl and
Google Cloud CLI .
To set up your environment with Cloud Shell, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, launch a Cloud Shell session and click
Activate Cloud Shell . This action launches a session in
the bottom pane of the Google Cloud console.
Set the default environment variables:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set billing/quota_project PROJECT_ID
export PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get project )
export CLUSTER_NAME = CLUSTER_NAME
export REGION = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
export ZONE = ZONE
export GCS_BUCKET_NAME = BUCKET_NAME
Replace the following values:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project
ID .
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your
GKE cluster.
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION : the Compute Engine
region where your
GKE cluster and TPU nodes are located. The region must contain
zones where TPU Trillium (v6e) machine types are available.
ZONE : a zone within your selected
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION region where TPU Trillium (v6e)
machine types are available. To list zones where TPU Trillium (v6e) TPUs are available, run the following command:
gcloud compute accelerator-types list --filter = "name~ct6e" --format = "value(zone)"
BUCKET_NAME : the name of the Cloud Storage bucket
that contains your training data.
Clone the sample repository:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples.git
cd kubernetes-engine-samples
Navigate to the working directory:
cd ai-ml/llm-training-jax-tpu-gemma3
Create and configure Google Cloud resources
In this section, you create and configure Google Cloud resources.
Create a GKE cluster
You can fine-tune an LLM on TPUs in a GKE Autopilot or
Standard cluster. We recommend that you use a Autopilot
cluster for a fully managed Kubernetes experience. To choose the
GKE mode of operation that's the best fit for your workloads, see
Choose a GKE mode of operation .
Autopilot
Create a GKE Autopilot cluster that uses
Workload Identity Federation for GKE
and has Cloud Storage FUSE enabled.
gcloud container clusters create-auto ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--location = ${ REGION }
The cluster creation might take several minutes.
Standard
Create a regional GKE Standard cluster that uses
Workload Identity Federation for GKE
and has Cloud Storage FUSE enabled.
gcloud container clusters create ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--enable-ip-alias \
--addons GcsFuseCsiDriver \
--machine-type = n2-standard-4 \
--num-nodes = 2 \
--workload-pool = ${ PROJECT_ID } .svc.id.goog \
--location = ${ REGION }
The cluster creation might take several minutes.
Create a single-host node pool:
gcloud container node-pools create jax-tpu-nodepool \
--cluster = ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--machine-type = ct6e-standard-1t \
--num-nodes = 1 \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--node-locations = ${ ZONE } \
--workload-metadata = GKE_METADATA
GKE creates a TPU Trillium node pool with a 1x1
topology and one node. The --workload-metadata=GKE_METADATA flag configures the node pool to use the GKE metadata server.
Install JobSet
Configure kubectl to communicate with your cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${ CLUSTER_NAME } --location = ${ REGION }
Install the latest released version of JobSet :
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/releases/download/ JOBSET_VERSION /manifests.yaml
Replace JOBSET_VERSION with the latest released version of JobSet . For example, v0.11.0 .
Verify the JobSet installation:
kubectl get pods -n jobset-system
The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
jobset-controller-manager-6c56668494-l4dhc 1/1 Running 0 4m45s
You might need to add more nodes if JobSet is waiting for resources.
Configure Cloud Storage FUSE
To fine-tune the LLM, you need to provide training data. In this tutorial, you use
the TinyStories dataset from Hugging Face.
This dataset contains short stories, synthetically generated by GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4, that use a limited vocabulary.
This section covers the steps to configure Cloud Storage FUSE to read data from a
Cloud Storage bucket.
Download the dataset:
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/resolve/main/TinyStories-train.txt?download = true -O TinyStories-train.txt
Upload the data into a new Cloud Storage bucket:
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// ${ GCS_BUCKET_NAME } \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--enable-hierarchical-namespace \
--uniform-bucket-level-access
gcloud storage cp TinyStories-train.txt gs:// ${ GCS_BUCKET_NAME }
To allow your workload to read data through Cloud Storage FUSE, create a
Kubernetes service account (KSA) and add the required permissions. Run the
permissionsetup.sh script:

After you run this script, the following resources are configured in your
Google Cloud project and GKE cluster:
A new IAM service account named gcs-fuse-sa is created in
your project.
The created Google Cloud Service Account (GSA) ( gcs-fuse-sa ) is granted
the roles/storage.objectViewer role on the Cloud Storage bucket
specified by ${GCS_BUCKET_NAME} . This permission allows the GSA to read objects from
the bucket.
A new KSA named jaxserviceaccount is created in the
default namespace within your GKE cluster.
The IAM policy of the GSA is updated to grant the
roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser role to the KSA.
This permission allows the KSA to impersonate the GSA.
The KSA is annotated to link it to the GSA. This annotation tells GKE
which GSA the KSA should impersonate by using Workload Identity.
Any Pod running in the default namespace of your GKE
cluster that uses the jaxserviceaccount service account will now be able to
authenticate as the gcs-fuse-sa GSA. These Pods will have read access to
the objects stored in the gs://${GCS_BUCKET_NAME} bucket, which is
essential for the fine-tuning Job to access the dataset by using
Cloud Storage FUSE.
Create the fine-tuning script
In this section, you explore the training script that performs a fine-tuning
operation on a
Gemma 3 model. This script uses the Gemma3Tokenizer .

In this script, the following applies:
A Gemma3Tokenizer converts text data into tokens that the model can
process.
The load_and_preprocess_data function reads the training data from a
file, splits it into individual stories, and uses the tokenizer to convert
the text into padded sequences of tokens.
The generate_text function takes the model, its parameters, and a
prompt to generate text.
The train_step function defines a single iteration of training that
includes the forward pass, loss calculation (using cross-entropy),
gradient computation, and parameter updates.
The train_model function iterates through the dataset for a specified
number of epochs, which calls the train_step function for each batch.
The run_training function orchestrates the entire process to load data,
initialize the Gemma 3 model ( Gemma3_270M ) and
optimizer, load pre-trained parameters, set up data sharding for parallel
processing, run a test generation, execute the training loop, and perform
a final text generation to demonstrate the effect of fine-tuning.
The script uses argparse library to accept command-line arguments for maxlen ,
batch_size , and datacount parameters.
Now that you have explored the fine-tuning script, containerize it to run on
GKE.
Containerize the fine-tuning script
Before you run the fine-tuning script in a GKE cluster, you need to
containerize it. This tutorial uses a JAX AI image as the base image.
Open the Dockerfile in the same directory as the Gemma3LLMTrain.py file:

Build the Docker image and push it to an image repository:
export REPOSITORY = REPOSITORY_NAME
export IMAGE_NAME = "jax-gemma3-training"
export IMAGE_TAG = "latest"
export DOCKERFILE_PATH = "./Dockerfile"
export IMAGE_URI = " ${ REGION } -docker.pkg.dev/ ${ PROJECT_ID } / ${ REPOSITORY } / ${ IMAGE_NAME } : ${ IMAGE_TAG } "
docker build -t " ${ IMAGE_URI } " -f " ${ DOCKERFILE_PATH } " .
gcloud auth configure-docker " ${ REGION } -docker.pkg.dev" -q
docker push " ${ IMAGE_URI } "
Replace REPOSITORY_NAME with the name of your Artifact Registry repository.
Add role bindings to the service account:
export PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format 'get(projectNumber)' )
gcloud artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding ${ REPOSITORY } \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--member = "serviceAccount: ${ PROJECT_NUMBER } -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/artifactregistry.reader"
With the image in the repository, you can now deploy the fine-tuning Job into a
GKE cluster.

GKE creates a Job that launches a Pod on a
TPU Trillium (v6e) node. This Pod runs the Python fine-tuning script, which
accesses the fine-tuning data from the specified Cloud Storage bucket
mounted at /data path by using Cloud Storage FUSE. The script then fine-tunes the
Gemma model.
Success: You've successfully fine-tuned a LLM model by using JAX and
TPU Trillium (v6e) in GKE!
Monitor the training Job
In this section, you monitor the progress of the fine-tuning Job and its
performance.
See fine-tuning progress
List the Pods:
# Find the Pods
kubectl get pods
Follow the log output:
kubectl logs -f pods/ POD_NAME
Replace POD_NAME with the name of your Pod.
The output is similar to the following:

Analyze the output:
The Global device count: 1 line indicates the TPU cores used.
The model generates reasonable text before this fine-tuning run because
it loads from a pre-trained checkpoint.
The output generated after fine-tuning shows more resemblance to the start
of a short story, indicating the model is learning from the new dataset.
Fine-tuning on the full dataset should produce even more refined outputs.

Alternative fine-tuning configurations
This section outlines alternative configurations for your fine-tuning workload.
Model selection
This tutorial used the Gemma3_270M model, which is a small model that fits
into a single-host TPU Trillium (v6e) node pool. For larger models that
require more memory and compute for fine-tuning, you can use multi-host or
multislice node pool configurations.
For a complete list of available models, see the Gemma documentation .
Important: When you use other models, ensure that you use the correct tokenizer
for the selected model.
Node pool configurations
This tutorial used a single-host node pool. You can also create
multi-host TPU slice node pools or
multislice node pools ,
depending on your needs.
The following tabs show how to create for multi-host and multislice
node pools:
Multi-host
In Cloud Shell, run the following command:
gcloud container node-pools create jax-tpu-multihost1 \
--cluster = ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--machine-type = ct6e-standard-4t \
--num-nodes = 2 \
--tpu-topology = 2x4 \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--node-locations = ${ ZONE }
GKE creates a TPU Trillium node pool with a 2x4
topology and two nodes.

Performance analysis and optimization
To analyze and optimize the performance of your machine learning fine-tuning, you
can use XProf . XProf is a suite of tools
that profiles and inspects ML workloads built with JAX, TensorFlow, or
PyTorch/XLA. By showing execution traces,
memory usage, and other data, XProf lets you fine-tune your models and training
setup for better efficiency and faster training.
To analyze the performance of your fine-tuning workload by using XProf, you
complete the following steps in this section:
Install the xprof package. Modify your training script to start the XProf
server.
Modify your Kubernetes Job manifest to include a volume mount for XProf
logs.
Grant the service account permissions to write XProf logs to a
Cloud Storage bucket.
Run XProf within your Pod and set up port forwarding to access the XProf
dashboard.
Install the XProf package
Navigate to the directory that contains the XProf samples:
cd ai-ml/llm-training-jax-tpu-gemma3/xprof-enabled
Build the Docker image and push it to an image repository:
export REPOSITORY = REPOSITORY_NAME
export IMAGE_NAME = "jax-gemma3-training-xp"
export IMAGE_TAG = "latest"
export DOCKERFILE_PATH = "./Dockerfile"
export IMAGE_URI = " ${ REGION } -docker.pkg.dev/ ${ PROJECT_ID } / ${ REPOSITORY } / ${ IMAGE_NAME } : ${ IMAGE_TAG } "
docker build -t " ${ IMAGE_URI } " -f " ${ DOCKERFILE_PATH } " .
gcloud auth configure-docker " ${ REGION } -docker.pkg.dev" -q
docker push " ${ IMAGE_URI } "
Replace REPOSITORY_NAME with the name of your Artifact Registry repository.

Grant the service account permissions to write XProf logs
To enable the service account to write and read, add the
"roles/storage.objectUser" role:
export GSA_NAME = " GSA_NAME " # Same as used in initial setup
# Automatically get the current project ID
export PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get-value project )
# Cloud Storage Bucket details
export XPROF_GCS_BUCKET_NAME = " XPROF_GCS_BUCKET_NAME "
# Derived Variables
export GSA_EMAIL = " ${ GSA_NAME } @ ${ PROJECT_ID } .iam.gserviceaccount.com"
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding "gs:// ${ XPROF_GCS_BUCKET_NAME } " \
--member = "serviceAccount: ${ GSA_EMAIL } " \
--role = "roles/storage.objectUser" \
--project = " ${ PROJECT_ID } "
Replace the following:
GSA_NAME : the name of the Google Service Account
to which to grant the role.
XPROF_GCS_BUCKET_NAME : the name of the bucket to
which to grant the role.
Run XProf within your Pod:
kubectl exec POD_NAME -c training-container -it -- bash # exec into the container
xprof --port 9001 --logdir /xprof # start xprof
Replace POD_NAME with the name of your Pod.
Access the XProf dashboard
Set up port forwarding to the XProf server in the Pod:
kubectl port-forward POD_NAME 9001 :9001
In your browser's address bar, enter the following:
http://localhost:9001/
The XProf Trace Viewer opens.
In the TensorBoard window, click Capture profile .
In the Profile Service URL(s) or TPU name field, enter localhost:9002 .
To capture more details, in
the Host Trace (TraceMe) Level , select verbose and enable Python trace logging.
To view the dashboard, click Capture .
TensorBoard captures the profile and lets you analyze the performance of the
training script. The graph shows the execution timeline for both TPU and CPU performance profiles:
For more profiling options to analyze your training workload performance, see
the JAX documentation on Profiling computation .
Fine-tuning in production environments
This tutorial showed you how to test
test JAX-based training in a distributed environment.
For optimized LLM fine-tuning in production, use the
Maxtext library. If you are interested in diffusion
models, use Maxdiffusion implementations.
For long-running training or fine-tuning workloads in production, set up workload checkpointing
to minimize progress loss during a failure. To learn more about setting up
multi-tier checkpointing, see
Train large-scale machine learning models on GKE with Multi-Tier Checkpointing .
