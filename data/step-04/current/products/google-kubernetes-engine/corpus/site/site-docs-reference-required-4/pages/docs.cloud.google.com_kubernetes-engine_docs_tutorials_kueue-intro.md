Autopilot
Standard
This tutorial shows you how to optimize available resources by scheduling
Jobs on
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Kueue . In this
tutorial, you learn to use Kueue to effectively manage and schedule batch jobs,
improve resource utilization, and simplify workload management. You set up
a shared cluster for two tenant teams where each team has its own namespace
and each team creates Jobs that share global resources. You also configure
Kueue to schedule the Jobs based on resource quotas that you define.
This tutorial is for Cloud architects and Platform engineers
who are interested in implementing a batch system using GKE.
To learn more about common roles and example tasks referenced in Google Cloud
content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Before reading this page, ensure that you're familiar with the following:
Autopilot mode and Standard mode
GPUs in GKE
Background
Jobs are applications that run to completion, such as machine learning, rendering,
simulation, analytics, CI/CD, and similar workloads.
Kueue is a cloud-native Job scheduler that works with the default
Kubernetes scheduler, the Job controller, and the cluster autoscaler to provide an
end-to-end batch system. Kueue implements Job queueing, deciding when Jobs should wait
and when they should start, based on quotas and a hierarchy for sharing resources
fairly among teams.
Kueue has the following characteristics:
It is optimized for cloud architectures, where resources are
heterogeneous, interchangeable, and scalable.
It provides a set of APIs to manage elastic quotas and manage Job queueing.
It does not re-implement existing capabilities such as autoscaling,
pod scheduling, or Job lifecycle management.
Kueue has built-in support for the Kubernetes batch/v1.Job API.
It can integrate with other job APIs.
Kueue refers to jobs defined with any API as Workloads, to avoid the confusion
with the specific Kubernetes Job API.

Set defaults for the Google Cloud CLI
In the Google Cloud console, start a Cloud Shell instance:
Open Cloud Shell
Download the source code for this sample app:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/batch/kueue-intro
Set the default environment variables:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set compute/region CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Replace the following values:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID .
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION : the Compute Engine region of the control plane of your cluster.
Create a GKE cluster
Create a GKE Autopilot cluster named kueue-autopilot :
gcloud container clusters create-auto kueue-autopilot \
--release-channel "rapid" --location CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Autopilot clusters are fully managed, and have built-in autoscaling.
Learn more about GKE Autopilot .
Kueue also supports Standard GKE with Node
Auto-provisioning and regular autoscaled node pools.
Note: Autopilot cluster creation can take up to five minutes to complete.
The outcome is similar to the following once the cluster is created:
NAME: kueue-autopilot
LOCATION: us-central1
MASTER_VERSION: 1.26.2-gke.1000
MASTER_IP: 35.193.173.228
MACHINE_TYPE: e2-medium
NODE_VERSION: 1.26.2-gke.1000
NUM_NODES: 3
STATUS: RUNNING
Where the STATUS is RUNNING for the kueue-autopilot .
Get authentication credentials for the cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials kueue-autopilot
Install Kueue on the cluster:
VERSION = VERSION
kubectl apply --server-side -f \
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases/download/ $VERSION /manifests.yaml
Replace VERSION with the latest version of Kueue. For more information about Kueue versions, see Kueue releases .
Wait until the Kueue Pods are ready:
watch kubectl -n kueue-system get pods
The output should be similar to the following before you can continue:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
kueue-controller-manager-66d8bb946b-wr2l2 2/2 Running 0 3m36s
Note: This step may take up to three minutes.
Create two new namespaces called team-a and team-b :
kubectl create namespace team-a
kubectl create namespace team-b
Create the ResourceFlavor
A ResourceFlavor is an object that represents the variations in the nodes available in your cluster by
associating them with node labels and taints. For example, you can use ResourceFlavors to
represent VMs with different provisioning guarantees (for example, spot versus on-demand), architectures
(for example, x86 versus ARM CPUs), brands and models (for example, Nvidia A100 versus T4 GPUs).
In this tutorial, the kueue-autopilot cluster has homogeneous resources.
As a result, create a single ResourceFlavor for CPU, memory, ephemeral-storage,
and GPUs, with no labels or taints.
apiVersion : kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind : ResourceFlavor
metadata :
name : default-flavor # This ResourceFlavor will be used for all the resources
Deploy the ResourceFlavor:
kubectl apply -f flavors.yaml
Create the ClusterQueue
A ClusterQueue is a cluster-scoped object that manages a pool of resources such
as CPU, memory, GPU. It manages the ResourceFlavors, and limits the usage and
dictates the order in which workloads are admitted.
apiVersion : kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind : ClusterQueue
metadata :
name : cluster-queue
spec :
namespaceSelector : {} # Available to all namespaces
queueingStrategy : BestEffortFIFO # Default queueing strategy
resourceGroups :
- coveredResources : [ "cpu" , "memory" , "nvidia.com/gpu" , "ephemeral-storage" ]
flavors :
- name : "default-flavor"
resources :
- name : "cpu"
nominalQuota : 10
- name : "memory"
nominalQuota : 10Gi
- name : "nvidia.com/gpu"
nominalQuota : 10
- name : "ephemeral-storage"
nominalQuota : 10Gi
Deploy the ClusterQueue:
kubectl apply -f cluster-queue.yaml
The order of consumption is determined by .spec.queueingStrategy , where there are two configurations:
BestEffortFIFO
The default queueing strategy configuration.
The workload admission follows the first in first out (FIFO) rule, but if there is not enough quota
to admit the workload at the head of the queue, the next one in line is tried.
StrictFIFO
Guarantees FIFO semantics.
Workload at the head of the queue can block queueing until the workload can be admitted.
In cluster-queue.yaml , you create a new ClusterQueue called cluster-queue . This
ClusterQueue manages four resources, cpu , memory , nvidia.com/gpu and
ephemeral-storage with the flavor created in flavors.yaml .
The quota is consumed by the requests in the workload Pod specs.
Each flavor includes usage limits represented as
.spec.resourceGroups[].flavors[].resources[].nominalQuota . In this case, the ClusterQueue admits
workloads if and only if:
The sum of the CPU requests is less than or equal to 10
The sum of the memory requests is less than or equal to 10Gi
The sum of GPU requests is less than or equal to 10
The sum of the storage used is less than or equal to 10Gi
Create the LocalQueue
A LocalQueue is a namespaced object that accepts workloads from users in the namespace.
LocalQueues from different namespaces can point to
the same ClusterQueue where they can share the resources' quota. In this case,
LocalQueue from namespace team-a and team-b points to the same ClusterQueue
cluster-queue under .spec.clusterQueue .
apiVersion : kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind : LocalQueue
metadata :
namespace : team-a # LocalQueue under team-a namespace
name : lq-team-a
spec :
clusterQueue : cluster-queue # Point to the ClusterQueue
---
apiVersion : kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind : LocalQueue
metadata :
namespace : team-b # LocalQueue under team-b namespace
name : lq-team-b
spec :
clusterQueue : cluster-queue # Point to the ClusterQueue
Each team sends their workloads to the LocalQueue in their own namespace.
Which are then allocated resources by the ClusterQueue.
Deploy the LocalQueues:
kubectl apply -f local-queue.yaml
Create Jobs and observe the admitted workloads
In this section, you create Kubernetes Jobs in the namespace team-a . A Job controller in Kubernetes creates one or more
Pods and helps ensure that they successfully execute a specific
task.
The Job in the namespace team-a has the following attributes:
It points to the lq-team-a LocalQueue.
It requests GPU resources by setting the nodeSelector field to
nvidia-tesla-t4 .
It is composed of three Pods that sleep for 10 seconds in parallel. Jobs are
cleaned up after 60 seconds according to the value defined in the
ttlSecondsAfterFinished field.
It requires 1,500 milliCPU, 1536 Mi of memory, 1,536 Mi of ephemeral storage,
and three GPUs since there are three Pods.
apiVersion : batch/v1
kind : Job
metadata :
namespace : team-a # Job under team-a namespace
generateName : sample-job-team-a-
annotations :
kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name : lq-team-a # Point to the LocalQueue
spec :
ttlSecondsAfterFinished : 60 # Job will be deleted after 60 seconds
parallelism : 3 # This Job will have 3 replicas running at the same time
completions : 3 # This Job requires 3 completions
suspend : true # Set to true to allow Kueue to control the Job when it starts
template :
spec :
nodeSelector :
cloud.google.com/gke-accelerator : "nvidia-tesla-t4" # Specify the GPU hardware
containers :
- name : dummy-job
image : gcr.io/k8s-staging-perf-tests/sleep:latest
args : [ "10s" ] # Sleep for 10 seconds
resources :
requests :
cpu : "500m"
memory : "512Mi"
ephemeral-storage : "512Mi"
nvidia.com/gpu : "1"
limits :
cpu : "500m"
memory : "512Mi"
ephemeral-storage : "512Mi"
nvidia.com/gpu : "1"
restartPolicy : Never
Jobs are also created under the file
job-team-b.yaml
where its namespace belongs to team-b , with requests to
represent different teams with different needs.
To learn more, see deploying GPU workloads in Autopilot .
In a new terminal, observe the status of the ClusterQueue that refreshes every two seconds:
watch -n 2 kubectl get clusterqueue cluster-queue -o wide
In a new terminal, observe the status of the nodes:
watch -n 2 kubectl get nodes -o wide
In a new terminal, create Jobs to LocalQueue from namespace team-a and team-b every 10 seconds:
./create_jobs.sh job-team-a.yaml job-team-b.yaml 10
Observe the Jobs being queued up, admitted in the ClusterQueue, and nodes being brought up with GKE Autopilot.
Note: It is normal to see a warning for the Pods with message Unschedulable while Nodes are scaling up.
Obtain a Job from namespace team-a :
kubectl -n team-a get jobs
The outcome is similar to the following:
NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE
sample-job-team-b-t6jnr 3/3 21s 3m27s
sample-job-team-a-tm7kc 0/3 2m27s
sample-job-team-a-vjtnw 3/3 30s 3m50s
sample-job-team-b-vn6rp 0/3 40s
sample-job-team-a-z86h2 0/3 2m15s
sample-job-team-b-zfwj8 0/3 28s
sample-job-team-a-zjkbj 0/3 4s
sample-job-team-a-zzvjg 3/3 83s 4m50s
Copy a Job name from the previous step and observe the admission status
and events for a Job through the Workloads API:
kubectl -n team-a describe workload JOB_NAME
When the pending Jobs start increasing from the ClusterQueue, end the script by pressing CTRL + C on the running script.
Once all Jobs are completed, notice the nodes being scaled down.
Note: The scale down process can take up to two minutes.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Delete the individual resource
Delete the Kueue quota system:
kubectl delete -n team-a localqueue lq-team-a
kubectl delete -n team-b localqueue lq-team-b
kubectl delete clusterqueue cluster-queue
kubectl delete resourceflavor default-flavor
Delete the Kueue manifest:
VERSION = VERSION
kubectl delete -f \
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases/download/ $VERSION /manifests.yaml
Delete the cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete kueue-autopilot --location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
