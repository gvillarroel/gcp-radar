Optimize AI training on TPUs with DWS and Kueue
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Standard
This document teaches you how to configure a GKE cluster to
maximize AI training availability on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). You
configure an automated fallback system using an open-source job queueing tool
called Kueue , and Google Cloud's
Dynamic Workload Scheduler
(DWS).
The configuration that you define in this document sets up a primary node pool
and a backup pool of nodes:
On-demand (Plan A): This node pool is your first choice for nodes. The
system first attempts to schedule jobs on these on-demand machines. The term
on-demand means that once these machines start running, you have reliable,
uninterrupted access to them.
DWS flex-start (Plan B): This is your backup node pool. When Plan A
machines aren't available, the Kueue scheduling program automatically
assigns your job to this Plan B pool. DWS then searches for the Plan B
hardware, but it doesn't guarantee immediate access because that hardware
might also be unavailable. DWS doesn't give up though: it holds your request
in line for up to 7 days and automatically provides the machines as soon as
they're available.
This approach minimizes the time jobs spend waiting in line. It means that you
don't have to manually check for available resources or rewrite your script for
different machines.
Overview of configuration steps
To configure the automated fallback system, you must complete several
configuration steps. It helps to divide this configuration into two categories:
Cluster Administrator tasks: One-time infrastructure configuration, such
as creating the GKE cluster, provisioning node pools, and
installing the Kueue scheduling controller.
AI Developer tasks: Repetitive, daily workflows, such as defining the
training job requirements and submitting the workload.
Even if you perform all of these steps yourself, keeping this distinction in
mind helps clarify the overall process.
Before you configure the system, review the configuration steps that you'll
perform.

Key concepts
On-demand (Plan A) node pool: The primary, high-priority node pool. Your
job always tries to use this pool first.
DWS flex-start (Plan B) node pool: The backup node pool. If machines in
the primary pool aren't available, the system automatically uses this pool
to search for available hardware.
Kueue: A scheduling program that manages the job queue. It intercepts
your job request and decides which node pool to use (Plan A or Plan B).
Job: The AI training workload you want to run. In this document, you
define it using a RayJob manifest.
Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud TPU API APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the APIs
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
Ensure that you have enough preemptible quota to use TPU flex-start VMs. If
the default quota isn't enough for your needs, request a higher allocation.
For details, see Cloud TPU
quotas and Set
up the Cloud TPU environment .
Define environment variables
To simplify the commands that you run in this document, you can set environment
variables in Cloud Shell . These variables
store values such as the ID of your Google Cloud project, the names of your node
pools, and the location of your GKE cluster.
After you define these variables, you can reuse them in multiple commands by
referencing the variable name (for example, $CLUSTER_NAME ) instead of retyping
or replacing values each time. This approach makes the process easier to follow
and reduces the risk of errors.
To define the following useful environment variables in Cloud Shell, run the
following commands:
export PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get project )
export PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects describe ${ PROJECT_ID } --format = "value(projectNumber)" )
export ZONE = " us-east5-b "
export REGION = " us-east5 "
export CLUSTER_NAME = " tpu-cluster "
export GKE_VERSION = " 1.34 "
export ONDEMAND_NODEPOOL = " on-demand-pool "
export DWS_NODEPOOL = " dws-pool "
Here's an explanation of these environment variables:
PROJECT_ID : The ID of your Google Cloud project.
PROJECT_NUMBER : The unique identifier number for your project (for
example, 123456789012).
ZONE : The compute zone for your cluster (for example, us-east5-b ).
Select a zone with availability for your chosen accelerator type. See
Cloud TPU quotas or GPU quotas for availability info.
REGION : The region where you create the cluster resources (for example,
us-east5 ).
CLUSTER_NAME : The name you choose for your GKE cluster.
GKE_VERSION : The GKE version of your cluster. Use version
1.34 or later.
ONDEMAND_NODEPOOL : The name of your standard on-demand node pool. (This is
your Plan A node pool).
DWS_NODEPOOL : The name of your DWS flex-start node pool. (This is your
Plan B node pool).
Configure the infrastructure (Cluster Administrator)
As the Cluster Administrator, you configure the GKE cluster and
node pools to support the fallback mechanism.
Create a GKE cluster
First, create the GKE cluster. This cluster is the environment in
which you install the Kueue controller, configure your node pools, and run your
AI training jobs. To create and connect to a cluster, perform these steps:
Create the cluster:
gcloud container clusters create ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--cluster-version = ${ GKE_VERSION } \
--machine-type = n2-standard-16 \
--location = ${ ZONE } \
--enable-image-streaming \
--addons = RayOperator \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID }
This command uses the following key flags:
--addons=RayOperator : Installs the Ray Operator on your cluster. You
need this operator to manage the RayJob workload that you submit later
in this document.
--enable-image-streaming : Allows your cluster to pull container images
faster. This feature significantly reduces the time it takes for large AI
container images to start running.
Retrieve the cluster's credentials so that the kubectl CLI can connect to
it. This command updates your Kubernetes config file, which is stored by
default in the ~/.kube/config directory:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--location = ${ ZONE } \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID }
Create the node pools
Create the primary and backup node pools for your environment: the on-demand
node pool ( Plan A ) and the DWS flex-start node pool ( Plan B ):
Create the on-demand node pool : This pool serves as the primary resource
for training jobs:
gcloud container node-pools create ${ ONDEMAND_NODEPOOL } \
--cluster = ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--location = ${ ZONE } \
--machine-type = ct6e-standard-4t \
--tpu-topology = 4x4 \
--reservation-affinity = none \
--enable-autoscaling \
--num-nodes = 0 \
--min-nodes = 0 \
--max-nodes = 4
In this example, your first choice machines are TPU v6e accelerators. You
specify this hardware using the --machine-type=ct6e-standard-4t flag. You
can change this machine type to match the hardware, such as GPUs or
different TPUs, that you want for your AI model.
Create the DWS flex-start node pool : In this example, you select the
same machine type ( --machine-type=ct6e-standard-4t ) that you chose for the
primary on-demand pool. Your Plan B node pool doesn't have to use a
different machine type. Because you really want this specific hardware,
making it your Plan B choice just means you switch to a different method of
acquiring it if it's not immediately available. This alternative method uses
DWS, which continuously searches for the available hardware for up to 7
days:
gcloud container node-pools create ${ DWS_NODEPOOL } \
--cluster = ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--location = ${ ZONE } \
--machine-type = ct6e-standard-4t \
--tpu-topology = 4x4 \
--reservation-affinity = none \
--enable-autoscaling \
--enable-queued-provisioning \
--flex-start \
--num-nodes = 0 \
--min-nodes = 0 \
--max-nodes = 4
These commands use the following key flags:
--num-nodes=0 , --min-nodes=0 , --max-nodes=4 , and
--enable-autoscaling : This combination allows the node pools to scale
up from zero nodes when a job needs them and scale back down when idle,
which helps save costs.
--tpu-topology : Defines the physical arrangement of the TPU chips. You
specify this layout because the physical arrangement of the chips affects
how fast your distributed training job runs.
--reservation-affinity=none : Helps ensure that the node pool doesn't
consume your pre-reserved hardware. Google Cloud lets you reserve
specific machines to help ensure availability. Setting this flag to
none tells the system to bypass those reservations and dynamically
request unreserved machines instead.
--enable-queued-provisioning and --flex-start : (Plan B pool only)
These flags enable DWS to provision nodes for your Plan B pool from
flexible capacity when it becomes available.
Verify the status of flex-start in the node pool
Inspect the DWS flex-start node pool and verify that flex-start is enabled:
gcloud container node-pools describe ${ DWS_NODEPOOL } \
--cluster = ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--location = ${ ZONE } \
--format = "get(config.flexStart)"
If flex-start is enabled, the output is True .
Install and configure Kueue (Cluster Administrator)
In this section, you install the Kueue controller on your cluster. Recall that
Kueue is a scheduling program that manages the job queue. It intercepts your job
request, decides which node pool to use (on-demand or DWS flex-start), and then
assigns the job.
Install Kueue
Run the following command to install Kueue. This command downloads the
installation manifests from the official repository and applies them to your
cluster:
helm install kueue oci://registry.k8s.io/kueue/charts/kueue \
--namespace kueue-system \
--create-namespace \
--set "controllerManager.featureGates[0].name=ElasticJobsViaWorkloadSlices" \
--set "controllerManager.featureGates[0].enabled=true"
Define the configuration rules
Create a YAML manifest that defines the priority rules. These rules tell Kueue
to use the on-demand pool first and the DWS flex-start pool second:
Create a file named dws-tpu-queue.yaml with the following content. This
file defines two flavors of resources (on-demand and DWS flex-start) and a
cluster queue that prioritizes them. This configuration file defines the
logic that Kueue uses to handle your jobs:
ResourceFlavor : At the beginning of this document, you created two
node pools and assigned them names using the environment variables
${ONDEMAND_NODEPOOL} and ${DWS_NODEPOOL} . When it created those node
pools, GKE automatically labeled every node in those
pools with the name you chose for those environment variables. The
ResourceFlavor section tells Kueue to look for nodes with those
labels.
ClusterQueue : This section of the manifest defines the priority rule.
It lists the on-demand flavor first, so Kueue tries to provision
on-demand machines first. If Kueue can't get those machines, it tries to
provision DWS flex-start machines instead.
Quotas : The file sets a quota , which is a limit on the total
resources (such as CPU, memory, and TPU chips) your jobs can use at any
given time in the on-demand node pool. When your jobs reach this limit,
Kueue automatically tries to provision DWS flex-start machines (your
Plan B machines), which you configured in dws-tpu-queue.yaml with a
much higher quota limit.

Apply the configuration to your cluster. The following command uses a
command-line tool called envsubst to replace placeholder variables that
appear in the file dws-tpu-queue.yaml . envsubst replaces the
placeholders with the values of the environment variables that you defined
earlier:
envsubst < dws-tpu-queue.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
Run a training job (AI Developer)
As the AI Developer, you define and submit a training workload by creating a
RayJob manifest. You specify your resource requirements in this manifest, and
the automated fallback system, which the Cluster administrator configured
earlier with Kueue and DWS, handles the underlying node pools for you.
In this section, you perform the following steps:
Create a Python training script.
Store that script in a Kubernetes ConfigMap.
Deploy a RayJob that mounts the ConfigMap as a volume so that the training
script can be executed on the nodes.
After performing these steps, Ray Train automatically distributes the JAX
workload across the nodes, and Kueue handles getting the machines you need.
The training script
Copy and paste the following Python script into a file called train.py :
import time
import ray
from ray import train
from ray.train import ScalingConfig
from ray.train.v2.jax import JaxTrainer
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
def train_func ():
# JaxTrainer handles JAX distributed setup.
print ( f "Local Devices: { jax . local_devices () } " )
# Simple Linear Regression Training Loop.
key = jax . random . PRNGKey ( 0 )
x = jax . random . normal ( key , ( 1000 , 10 ))
w_true = jax . random . normal ( key , ( 10 , 1 ))
y = jnp . dot ( x , w_true )
# Initialize weights
w = jnp . zeros (( 10 , 1 ))
learning_rate = 0.1
@jax . jit
def update ( w , x , y ):
y_pred = jnp . dot ( x , w )
loss = jnp . mean (( y_pred - y ) ** 2 )
grad = jax . grad ( lambda w : jnp . mean (( jnp . dot ( x , w ) - y ) ** 2 ))( w )
return w - learning_rate * grad , loss
# Training loop
print ( "Starting training..." )
for epoch in range ( 50 ):
w , loss = update ( w , x , y )
if epoch % 10 == 0 :
train . report ({ "loss" : loss . item (), "epoch" : epoch })
print ( f "Epoch { epoch } : Loss { loss : .4f } " )
print ( "Training Complete!" )
# Allow metrics to sync before closing
time . sleep ( 3 )
def main ():
scaling_config = ScalingConfig (
num_workers = 4 ,
resources_per_worker = { "TPU" : 4 },
use_tpu = True ,
topology = "4x4" ,
accelerator_type = "TPU-V6E"
)
trainer = JaxTrainer (
train_loop_per_worker = train_func ,
scaling_config = scaling_config
)
result = trainer . fit ()
print ( f "Run Result: { result . metrics } " )
if __name__ == "__main__" :
main ()
The training script uses JAX , a Python library
for high-performance numerical computing, to train a linear regression model.
This script is a simplified example designed to demonstrate how to use DWS and
Kueue for automated fallback, and doesn't perform data
parallelism
or model
parallelism .
Notice that the ScalingConfig section of the training script defines the
hardware requirements for the training job. That section requests a 4x4 TPU
topology, which matches the physical layout of the node pools you configured
earlier.
Create the ConfigMap
Upload the contents of your train.py script into a Kubernetes
ConfigMap object. This allows the cluster to store the script and make it
available to your RayJob:
kubectl create configmap jax-train-script --from-file = train.py
The RayJob that you define in the next section mounts this ConfigMap as a
volume. This makes the script file appear inside the Ray containers so that the
Ray software can find and execute it.
Apply the RayJob manifest
Create a file named rayjob-tpu-v6e-dws.yaml with the following content. This
manifest defines your training job and tells the system how to route it:
apiVersion : ray.io/v1
kind : RayJob
metadata :

cloud.google.com/gke-tpu-topology : 4x4
This manifest includes three configurations that make the fallback system work:
Requests specific hardware: The nodeSelector section specifies the
hardware that your script requires (in this example, a tpu-v6e-slice with
a 4x4 topology).
Selects the queue: The kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name label routes your job
directly to Kueue. This enables the automated fallback logic.
Tolerates DWS flex-start nodes: The tolerations section allows the job
to run on your Plan B node pool. Because DWS flex-start nodes are specially
marked (tainted) by GKE so that normal workloads don't
accidentally run on them, your job must explicitly tolerate the
cloud.google.com/gke-queued taint.
Submit the workload
To prove that the fallback system works, you need to submit two jobs. The first
job consumes the Plan A on-demand capacity, which forces the second job to fall
back to the Plan B DWS flex-start capacity.
Run the following command to submit the two jobs. The command uses a for loop
and envsubst to inject a unique job ID into the manifest for each run:
for i in 1 2 ; do
export JOB_ID = $i
envsubst < rayjob-tpu-v6e-dws.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
echo "Submitted Job $i "
sleep 2
done
After you submit the jobs, the system handles the workload as follows:
Intercept: Kueue detects the jobs by using the queue label and
temporarily suspends them.
Decision: Kueue evaluates resource availability against the
administrator's rules. It checks the Plan A pool first.
Assignment:
Because Plan A resources are available for the first job, Kueue assigns
Job 1 there.
Because Job 1 consumes the Plan A resources, Kueue automatically assigns
Job 2 to the Plan B (DWS flex-start) pool.
Launch: Kueue unsuspends the jobs. This action triggers the
GKE cluster autoscaler to provision the nodes and start the
training scripts.
Connect to the RayJob
As a final verification step, you can use the kubectl port-forward command to
connect to the Ray Dashboard and watch your jobs run.
To check the status of your first job, run the following command:
kubectl port-forward service/rayjob-tpu-v6e-dws-1-head-svc 8265 :8265 &
After you run this command, open a web browser and go to
http://localhost:8265 . In the Ray Dashboard, you can view the job status and
reported metrics to verify that both jobs complete successfully on their
respective node pools.
You can also view the logs for the first job by running the following command:
kubectl logs job/rayjob-tpu-v6e-dws-1
The truncated output of the training script should resemble the following. You
should see the messages Training Complete! and Job
'rayjob-tpu-v6e-dws-1-498t6' succeeded near the end of the output:

Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used
in this document, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep
the project and delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Delete the individual resources
If you want to keep the GGoogle Cloud project you used in this document, run the
following command to delete the cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--location = ${ ZONE } \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--quiet
Summary
In this document, you configured and tested a Ray training environment. This
environment uses a primary node pool and a backup DWS pool to maximize hardware
availability. By automatically falling back to DWS when primary machines are
unavailable, you minimized the time your training jobs spend waiting in line.
To get this working, you performed the following steps:
Created a GKE cluster: Established the environment to
host the node pools and scheduling tools.
Configured the node pools: Created an on-demand node pool (Plan A) and a
DWS node pool (Plan B).
Installed and configured Kueue: Deployed the Kueue controller and
applied priority rules instructing the system to try Plan A first and fall
back to Plan B.
Created a ConfigMap: Deployed a simplified JAX training script to the
cluster to serve as the test workload.
Defined a RayJob manifest: Configured the job to request specific
hardware, route to the Kueue controller, and tolerate DWS nodes.
Submitted the workload: Submitted two jobs to force Kueue to
automatically route the second job to Plan B when Plan A resources are
consumed.
Verified the results: Used port forwarding to connect to the Ray
Dashboard and confirmed that both jobs ran successfully.
