Deploy GPU-accelerated Ray for AI workloads on GKE
Autopilot
Standard
This page shows you how to set up and run a GPU-enabled Ray cluster on
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to scale your AI/ML workloads.
Why use Ray?
Using Ray on GKE, facilitated by KubeRay , lets you scale Python and AI applications. Ray handles
the application scaling, and GKE manages the underlying servers
and resources.
This combination makes it easier to manage resources, automatically adjust
capacity, ensure reliability, and deploy your applications across various
environments. By connecting your distributed Ray applications with your existing
cloud infrastructure and tools on GKE, you can simplify
operations and provision a robust, scalable platform for complex tasks by using
standard Kubernetes methods.
For more information, see the blog post Why GKE for your Ray AI workloads .
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure you have performed the following tasks:
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the GKE API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Configure the gcloud CLI to use your federated identity.
For more information, see
Sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Install kubectl : kubectl is the primary command line tool for
interacting with GKE clusters. If you use Cloud Shell,
kubectl is already installed. Otherwise, install it in your terminal
by running the gcloud components install kubectl command.
To verify your installation, run this command: kubectl version --client
Install Ray : we highly recommend that you create and enter
a Python virtual environment ( venv ) before you install Ray so
that you can isolate its dependencies.
Install Python .
Create and activate a new virtual environment .
Install the latest stable version of Ray by running this command inside
your virtual environment: pip install -U "ray[default]" .
To verify your installation, run this command: ray --version . Note the
Ray version (for example, 2.44.1) in the output.
Ensure your Google Cloud project has sufficient quota for L4 GPUs. For
more information, see About GPUs
and Allocation quotas .
Create a GKE cluster
You can deploy your workload in a GKE Autopilot or
Standard cluster. We recommend that you use an Autopilot
cluster for a fully managed Kubernetes experience. To choose the GKE
mode of operation that's the best fit for your workloads, see
Choose a GKE mode of operation .
Autopilot
In Autopilot mode ,
Google manages your cluster configuration, including scaling, security, and
other preconfigured settings. Autopilot clusters are optimized to run
most production workloads and provision compute resources based on your
Kubernetes manifests.
In the terminal, run the following gcloud container clusters create-auto command:
gcloud container clusters create-auto my-ray-enabled-cluster \
--enable-ray-operator \
--enable-ray-cluster-monitoring \
--enable-ray-cluster-logging \
--location = us-central1
This Google Cloud CLI command creates an Autopilot cluster named my-ray-enabled-cluster , with these settings:
--enable-ray-operator : installs the Ray Operator on the cluster, which
simplifies managing Ray clusters within Kubernetes.
--enable-ray-cluster-monitoring : sets up integration with
Cloud Monitoring for Ray cluster metrics.
--enable-ray-cluster-logging : configures integration with Cloud Logging
to collect logs from your Ray cluster.
--location=us-central1 : specifies the geographical region where the
GKE cluster will be created. Be aware that accelerator
availability and supported types vary by location. For more information,
see GPU regions and zones .
Autopilot clusters automatically provisions and scales nodes (including
GPU-enabled ones that use compute classes) based on workload demands, optimizing
both utilization and cost. This automatic provisioning and scaling of resources
in Autopilot clusters simplifies resource management, and lets you
focus on your models instead of infrastructure.
If you use a GKE Standard cluster, the flags
and settings for enabling Ray might be different. For more information, see
Enable the Ray Operator on GKE .
Configure kubectl to communicate with your cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-ray-enabled-cluster \
--location = us-central1
Standard
In Standard mode ,
you have more control over the underlying
infrastructure of your GKE cluster. You manage node pools,
node sizes, and other configurations directly, allowing for greater
customization. Standard clusters are suitable for workloads that
need specific configurations or tight control over resources.
In the terminal, run the following gcloud container clusters create command:
gcloud container clusters create my-ray-enabled-cluster \
--addons = RayOperator \
--enable-ray-cluster-monitoring \
--enable-ray-cluster-logging \
--location = us-central1 \
--enable-autoprovisioning \
--max-cpu = 10 \
--max-memory = 64
This Google Cloud CLI command creates an Standard cluster named
my-ray-enabled-cluster , with these settings:
--addons=RayOperator : installs the Ray Operator on the cluster, which
simplifies managing Ray clusters within Kubernetes.
--enable-ray-cluster-monitoring : sets up integration with
Cloud Monitoring for Ray cluster metrics.
--enable-ray-cluster-logging : configures integration with Cloud Logging
to collect logs from your Ray cluster.
--location=us-central1 : specifies the geographical region where the
GKE cluster will be created. Be aware that accelerator
availability and supported types vary by location. For more information,
see GPU regions and zones .
--enable-autoprovisioning : automatically creates and deletes
node pools and scale
nodes within those pools based on your workload's
demands.
--max-cpu : maximum number of cores to which the cluster can scale.
--max-memory : maximum number of gigabytes of memory to which the
cluster can scale.
Configure kubectl to communicate with your cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-ray-enabled-cluster \
--location = us-central1
Install the KubeRay kubectl ray plugin
The kubectl ray plugin simplifies common Ray on Kubernetes workflows. For the
latest installation instructions, see the KubeRay documentation .
Go to the
releases page
and download the binary for your platform. For example, to install kubectl
ray plugin version 1.3.2 on Linux amd64, run the following commands:
curl -LO https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/releases/download/v1.3.2/kubectl-ray_v1.3.2_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf kubectl-ray_v1.3.2_linux_amd64.tar.gz
cp kubectl-ray ~/.local/bin
Replace ~/.local/bin with the directory in your PATH .
Verify your installation:
kubectl ray version
If you see a warning like KubeRay operator installation cannot be found: no KubeRay operator deployments found in any namespace. , you can safely ignore it.
If the installation was successful, the output is the version of
the kubectl ray plugin.
Create the custom compute class in your cluster
A custom compute class
in GKE lets you define specific hardware requirements,
like the GPU type and count, by priority. GKE uses this priority when
provisioning nodes for your workloads.
To create the example custom compute class for this guide, follow these
steps:
Save the following compute class specification as nvidia-l4-compute-class.yaml :
apiVersion : cloud.google.com/v1
kind : ComputeClass
metadata :
name : gpu-compute-class
spec :
priorities :
- gpu :
type : nvidia-l4
count : 1
spot : true
- gpu :
type : nvidia-l4
count : 1
spot : false
nodePoolAutoCreation :
enabled : true
whenUnsatisfiable : DoNotScaleUp
Create the compute class by by running this command:
kubectl apply -f nvidia-l4-compute-class.yaml
What happens after you apply the custom compute class?
After applying the compute class YAML file, GKE will automatically
provision nodes with one NVIDIA L4 GPU when your Ray cluster requests them.
It will prioritize Spot VMs as defined in your manifest.
The whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotScaleUp setting
instructs GKE to not create nodes that don't meet the
specified requirements.
Create and verify the Ray cluster
You can now create your Ray cluster on your GKE cluster.
Create the Ray cluster . Use the kubectl ray create cluster
command to define and create your Ray cluster. This command simplifies the
process by handling the underlying Kubernetes resource creation.
kubectl ray create cluster my-ray-cluster \
--worker-replicas = 1 \
--worker-cpu = 2 \
--worker-memory = 4Gi \
--worker-gpu = 1 \
--worker-node-selectors = "cloud.google.com/compute-class=gpu-compute-class"
The kubectl ray create cluster command uses the KubeRay plugin to
translate your specifications into a RayCluster custom resource definition and sends it to
the Kubernetes API to create the RayCluster object. This object acts as a
blueprint, telling the Ray Operator how to provision and manage the actual
Ray cluster components (head and worker nodes) within GKE.
By default, GKE schedules the head Pod on a node from the E2 machine series.
The example command uses these settings:
kubectl ray create cluster my-ray-cluster : specifies the name of the
Ray cluster you want to create.
--worker-node-selectors : tells Kubernetes to schedule worker Pods on
nodes that are labeled with cloud.google.com/compute-class=gpu-compute-class .
Important: For best results, use the
--ray-version flag with the kubectl ray create cluster command to match your
local Ray and Python versions with the corresponding versions in the Ray
cluster. Keeping versions closely aligned generally improves stability.
Verify the Ray cluster status . Use these commands to verify that
your Ray cluster is up and running.
Check the RayCluster resource by running this command:
kubectl ray get cluster
This command lists all the Ray clusters in your Kubernetes namespace. You
should see my-ray-cluster listed. It might take a few minutes for the
cluster to initialize.
Check the Kubernetes Pods by running this command:
kubectl get pods
This command lists all the Pods that are running in your Kubernetes namespace. You
should see Pods related to your Ray cluster:
A Pod for the Ray head node, with a name like my-ray-cluster-head-0 .
One or more Pods for the Ray worker nodes, with names like
my-ray-cluster-worker-group-0-xxxxx . The number of worker Pods depends on
the initial configuration of your Ray cluster and any autoscaling that
might have occurred.
Submit a Ray job
After your Ray cluster is ready, you can submit a Ray job to your running Ray
cluster on GKE.
To do this, use the kubectl ray session command to start an interactive
session, and the ray job submit command to start job execution.
Start a Ray interactive session . To establish a local connection to
your Ray cluster, run this command:
kubectl ray session my-ray-cluster
This command initiates port forwarding between your local machine and the Ray
head node in your GKE cluster. Note that your terminal will
be occupied while this session is active; to proceed, open a separate
terminal instance.
Create the sample code to run . Save the following example code to a
file named sample_code.py .
Tip: For training and deploying your actual AI/ML
models in production, you would substitute this basic example with Python
code that utilizes libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. For a more comprehensive PyTorch training example, see pytorch-mnist/train.py .
import ray
import os
import requests
ray . init ()
@ray . remote
class Counter :
def __init__ ( self ):
# Used to verify runtimeEnv
self . name = os . getenv ( "counter_name" )
assert self . name == "test_counter"
self . counter = 0
def inc ( self ):
self . counter += 1
def get_counter ( self ):
return " {} got {} " . format ( self . name , self . counter )
counter = Counter . remote ()
for _ in range ( 5 ):
ray . get ( counter . inc . remote ())
print ( ray . get ( counter . get_counter . remote ()))
# Verify that the correct runtime env was used for the job.
assert requests . __version__ == "2.26.0"
Open a new terminal and submit the Ray job .
Open a new terminal on your local machine. If you created a virtual
environment for your Ray installation, ensure you activate it in this new
terminal as well.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the sample_code.py file.
Run the following command:
ray job submit \
--working-dir = . \
--runtime-env-json = '{"pip": ["requests==2.26.0"], "env_vars": {"counter_name": "test_counter"}}' \
--address http://localhost:8265 python sample_code.py
The example command uses these settings:
--working-dir=. : specifies the current directory as the working
directory to be made available to the Ray job on the cluster.
Ideally, this directory contains just the application source code
you want to run on Ray. In our example, this is the sample_code.py file.
--runtime-env-json='{"pip": ["requests==2.26.0"], "env_vars":
{"counter_name": "test_counter"}}' : defines the runtime environment for
the job. It specifies the required Python library version
( requests==2.26.0 ) and sets an environment variable ( counter_name ) for
the job's execution.
View the Ray job . You can monitor the job in one of these ways:
Ray dashboard : open your web browser and go to
http://localhost:8265 . This URL opens the Ray dashboard, where you can
see information about your running job, including its status, logs, and
resource usage.
Metrics Explorer : use the prebuilt metrics dashboards in the
Google Cloud console. For more information, see
Collect and view logs and metrics for Ray clusters on GKE .
Terminate the Ray session . After you finish interacting with
the Ray cluster or monitoring your job, you can terminate the interactive
session by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal where you ran the
kubectl ray session command.
Success: Congratulations on deploying your first Ray job on GKE!
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, follow these steps.
If you deployed the quickstart in a new Google Cloud project, and if you no
longer need the project, delete it by completing the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page .
In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, enter the project ID, and the click Shut down to delete the project.
If you did not create a new Google Cloud project, and if you no longer need the
GKE cluster, you can delete it by running this command:
gcloud container clusters delete my-ray-enabled-cluster \
--location = us-central1
