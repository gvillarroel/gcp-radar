Standard
Autopilot
This tutorial shows you how to efficiently share accelerator resources between
training- and inference-serving workloads within a single Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
cluster. By distributing your mixed workloads across a single cluster,
you improve resource utilization, simplify cluster management, reduce issues
from accelerator quantity limitations, and enhance overall cost-effectiveness.
In this tutorial, you create a high-priority serving Deployment
using the Gemma 2 large language
model (LLM) for inference and the Hugging Face TGI (Text Generation Interface) serving
framework, along with a low-priority LLM fine-tuning Job. Both workloads
run on a single cluster that uses NVIDIA L4 GPUs. You use
Kueue ,
an open source Kubernetes-native Job queueing system, to manage and schedule your
workloads. Kueue lets you prioritize serving tasks and preempt lower-priority
training Jobs to optimize resource utilization. As serving
demands decrease, you reallocate the freed-up accelerators to resume training
Jobs. You use Kueue and priority classes to manage resource quotas throughout
the process.
This tutorial is intended for Machine learning (ML) engineers,
Platform admins and operators, and Data and AI specialists who want to train
and host a machine learning (ML) model on a GKE cluster, and who
also want to reduce costs and management overhead, especially when dealing with
a limited number of accelerators. To learn more about common roles and example
tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Before reading this page, ensure that you're familiar with the following:

Click Your Profile > Settings > Access Tokens .
Select New Token .
Specify a Name of your choice and a Role of at least Read .
Select Generate a token .
Copy the generated token to your clipboard.
Launch Cloud Shell
In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell to manage resources hosted on
Google Cloud. Cloud Shell comes preinstalled with the software you need
for this tutorial, including
kubectl ,
gcloud CLI , and Terraform .
To set up your environment with Cloud Shell, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, launch a Cloud Shell session by clicking
Activate Cloud Shell in the Google Cloud console . This launches a session in the
bottom pane of Google Cloud console.
Set the default environment variables:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
export PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get project )
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud
project ID .
Clone the sample code from GitHub. In Cloud Shell, run the following commands:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/ai-ml/mix-train-and-inference
export EXAMPLE_HOME = $( pwd )
Create a GKE cluster
You can use an Autopilot or Standard cluster for your mixed
workloads. We recommend that you use an Autopilot cluster for a fully
managed Kubernetes experience. To choose the GKE mode of
operation that's the best fit for your workloads, see
Choose a GKE mode of operation .
Autopilot
Set the default environment variables in Cloud Shell:
export HF_TOKEN = HF_TOKEN
export REGION = REGION
export CLUSTER_NAME = "llm-cluster"
export PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects list \
--filter = " $( gcloud config get-value project ) " \
--format = "value(PROJECT_NUMBER)" )
export MODEL_BUCKET = "model-bucket- $PROJECT_ID "
Replace the following values:
HF_TOKEN : the Hugging Face token you generated
earlier.
REGION : a region that supports the accelerator
type you want to use, for example, us-central1 for the L4 GPU.
You can adjust the MODEL_BUCKET variable—this
represents the Cloud Storage bucket where you store your trained
model weights.
Create an Autopilot cluster:
gcloud container clusters create-auto ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--release-channel = rapid
Create the Cloud Storage bucket for the fine-tuning job:
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// ${ MODEL_BUCKET } \
--location ${ REGION } \
--uniform-bucket-level-access
To grant access to the Cloud Storage bucket, run this command:
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding "gs:// $MODEL_BUCKET " \
--role = roles/storage.objectAdmin \
--member = principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/ $PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ $PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog/subject/ns/llm/sa/default \
--condition = None
To get authentication credentials for the cluster, run this command:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials llm-cluster \
--location = $REGION \
--project = $PROJECT_ID
Create a namespace for your Deployments. In Cloud Shell, run the following
command:
kubectl create ns llm
Standard
Set the default environment variables in Cloud Shell:
export HF_TOKEN = HF_TOKEN
export REGION = REGION
export CLUSTER_NAME = "llm-cluster"
export GPU_POOL_MACHINE_TYPE = "g2-standard-24"
export GPU_POOL_ACCELERATOR_TYPE = "nvidia-l4"
export PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects list \
--filter = " $( gcloud config get-value project ) " \
--format = "value(PROJECT_NUMBER)" )
export MODEL_BUCKET = "model-bucket- $PROJECT_ID "
Replace the following values:
HF_TOKEN : the Hugging Face token you generated
earlier.
REGION : the region that supports the accelerator
type you want to use, for example, us-central1 for the L4 GPU.
You can adjust these variables:
GPU_POOL_MACHINE_TYPE : the node pool machine series that you want to
use in your selected region. This value depends on the accelerator type
you selected. To learn more, see Limitations of using GPUs on GKE . For example, this
tutorial uses g2-standard-24 with two GPUs attached per node. For the
most up-to-date list of available GPUs, see GPUs for Compute Workloads .
GPU_POOL_ACCELERATOR_TYPE : the accelerator type
that's supported in your selected region. For example, this tutorial uses nvidia-l4 . For the
latest list of available GPUs, see GPUs for Compute Workloads .
MODEL_BUCKET : the Cloud Storage bucket where
you store your trained model weights.
Create a Standard cluster:
gcloud container clusters create ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--workload-pool = ${ PROJECT_ID } .svc.id.goog \
--release-channel = rapid \
--machine-type = e2-standard-4 \
--addons GcsFuseCsiDriver \
--num-nodes = 1
Create the GPU node pool for inference and fine-tuning workloads:
gcloud container node-pools create gpupool \
--accelerator type = ${ GPU_POOL_ACCELERATOR_TYPE } ,count = 2 ,gpu-driver-version = latest \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--node-locations = ${ REGION } -a \
--cluster = ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--machine-type = ${ GPU_POOL_MACHINE_TYPE } \
--num-nodes = 3
Create the Cloud Storage bucket for the fine-tuning job:
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// ${ MODEL_BUCKET } \
--location ${ REGION } \
--uniform-bucket-level-access
To grant access to the Cloud Storage bucket, run this command:
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding "gs:// $MODEL_BUCKET " \
--role = roles/storage.objectAdmin \
--member = principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/ $PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ $PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog/subject/ns/llm/sa/default \
--condition = None
To get authentication credentials for the cluster, run this command:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials llm-cluster \
--location = $REGION \
--project = $PROJECT_ID
Create a namespace for your Deployments. In Cloud Shell, run the following
command:
kubectl create ns llm
Create a Kubernetes Secret for Hugging Face credentials
To create a Kubernetes Secret that contains the Hugging Face token, run the
following command:
kubectl create secret generic hf-secret \
--from-literal = hf_api_token = $HF_TOKEN \
--dry-run = client -o yaml | kubectl apply --namespace = llm --filename = -
Configure Kueue
In this tutorial, Kueue is the central resource manager, enabling efficient
sharing of GPUs between your training and serving workloads. Kueue achieves this
by defining resource requirements ("flavors"), prioritizing workloads through
queues (with serving tasks prioritized over training), and dynamically allocating
resources based on demand and priority. This tutorial uses the
Workload resource
type to group the inference and fine-tuning workloads, respectively.
Kueue's preemption feature ensures that high-priority serving
workloads always have the necessary resources by pausing or evicting
lower-priority training Jobs when resources are scarce.
To control the inference server Deployment with Kueue, you enable pod integration and configure managedJobsNamespaceSelector to exclude the
kube-system and kueue-system namespaces.
In the /kueue directory, view the code in kustomization.yaml . This
manifest installs the Kueue resource manager with custom configurations.

In Cloud Shell, run the following command to install Kueue:
cd ${ EXAMPLE_HOME }
kubectl kustomize kueue | kubectl apply --server-side --filename = -
Wait until the Kueue Pods are ready:
watch kubectl --namespace = kueue-system get pods
The output should look similar to the following:

kueue-controller-manager-bdc956fc4-vhcmx 1/1 Running 0 3m15s
In the /workloads directory, view the flavors.yaml , cluster-queue.yaml , and
local-queue.yaml files. These manifests specify how Kueue manages resource quotas:
ResourceFlavor
This manifest defines a default
ResourceFlavor
in Kueue for resource management.
apiVersion : kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind : ResourceFlavor
metadata :
name : default-flavor
ClusterQueue
This manifest sets up a Kueue
ClusterQueue
with resource limits for CPU, memory, and GPU.
This tutorial uses nodes with two Nvidia L4 GPUs attached, with the corresponding node type of g2-standard-24 , offering 24 vCPU and 96 GB RAM. The example
code shows how to limit your workload's resource usage to a maximum of six GPUs.
The preemption field in the ClusterQueue configuration references the PriorityClasses to determine which Pods can be preempted when resources are
scarce.

Deploy the TGI inference server
In this section, you deploy the TGI container to serve the Gemma
2 model.
In the /workloads directory, view the tgi-gemma-2-9b-it-hp.yaml file. This
manifest defines a Kubernetes Deployment to deploy the TGI serving runtime and gemma-2-9B-it model. A Deployment is a Kubernetes API object that lets you run multiple replicas of Pods that are distributed among the nodes in a cluster..
The Deployment prioritizes inference tasks and uses two GPUs for the model.
It uses tensor parallelism , by setting the NUM_SHARD
environment variable, to fit the model into GPU memory.

Apply the manifest by running the following command:
kubectl apply --filename = tgi-gemma-2-9b-it-hp.yaml --namespace = llm
The deployment operation will take a few minutes to complete.
To check if GKE successfully created the Deployment, run the
following command:
kubectl --namespace = llm get deployment
The output should look similar to the following:
NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE
tgi-gemma-deployment 1/1 1 1 5m13s
Verify Kueue quota management
In this section, you confirm that Kueue is correctly enforcing the
GPU quota for your Deployment.
To check if Kueue is aware of your Deployment, run this command to retrieve the
status of the Workload objects:
kubectl --namespace = llm get workloads
The output should look similar to the following:
NAME QUEUE RESERVED IN ADMITTED FINISHED AGE
pod-tgi-gemma-deployment-6bf9ffdc9b-zcfrh-84f19 lq cluster-queue True 8m23s
To test overriding the quota limits, scale the Deployment to four replicas:
kubectl scale --replicas = 4 deployment/tgi-gemma-deployment --namespace = llm
Run the following command to see the number of replicas that GKE
deploys:
kubectl get workloads --namespace = llm
The output should look similar to the following:
NAME QUEUE RESERVED IN ADMITTED FINISHED AGE
pod-tgi-gemma-deployment-6cb95cc7f5-5thgr-3f7d4 lq cluster-queue True 14s
pod-tgi-gemma-deployment-6cb95cc7f5-cbxg2-d9fe7 lq cluster-queue True 5m41s
pod-tgi-gemma-deployment-6cb95cc7f5-tznkl-80f6b lq 13s
pod-tgi-gemma-deployment-6cb95cc7f5-wd4q9-e4302 lq cluster-queue True 13s
The output shows that only three Pods are admitted due to the resource
quota that Kueue enforces.
Run the following to display the Pods in the llm namespace:
kubectl get pod --namespace = llm
The output should look similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
tgi-gemma-deployment-7649884d64-6j256 1/1 Running 0 4m45s
tgi-gemma-deployment-7649884d64-drpvc 0/1 SchedulingGated 0 7s
tgi-gemma-deployment-7649884d64-thdkq 0/1 Pending 0 7s
tgi-gemma-deployment-7649884d64-znvpb 0/1 Pending 0 7s
Now, scale down the Deployment back to 1. This step is required before
deploying the fine-tuning job, otherwise it won't get admitted due to the
inference job having priority.
kubectl scale --replicas = 1 deployment/tgi-gemma-deployment --namespace = llm
Explanation of the behavior
The scaling example results in only three replicas (despite scaling to four)
because of the GPU quota limit that you set in the ClusterQueue configuration. The
ClusterQueue's spec.resourceGroups section defines a nominalQuota of "6" for
nvidia.com/gpu . The Deployment specifies that each Pod requires "2" GPUs.
Therefore, the ClusterQueue can only accommodate a maximum of three replicas of
the Deployment at a time (since 3 replicas * 2 GPUs per replica = 6 GPUs, which
is the total quota).
When you attempt to scale to four replicas, Kueue recognizes that this action would
exceed the GPU quota and it prevents the fourth replica from being scheduled. This
is indicated by the SchedulingGated status of the fourth Pod. This behavior
demonstrates Kueue's resource quota enforcement.
Deploy the training Job
In this section, you deploy a lower-priority fine-tuning Job for a Gemma
2 model that requires four GPUs across two Pods. A Job controller in Kubernetes creates one or more
Pods and helps ensure that they successfully execute a specific
task.
This Job will use the remaining GPU
quota in the ClusterQueue. The Job uses a prebuilt image and saves checkpoints
to allow restarting from intermediate results.
The fine-tuning Job uses the b-mc2/sql-create-context dataset. The source for the fine-tuning job can be found in the repository .
View the fine-tune-l4.yaml file. This manifest defines the fine-tuning Job.

Apply the manifest to create the fine-tuning Job:
cd ${ EXAMPLE_HOME } /workloads
sed -e "s/<MODEL_BUCKET>/ $MODEL_BUCKET /g" \
-e "s/<PROJECT_ID>/ $PROJECT_ID /g" \
-e "s/<REGION>/ $REGION /g" \
fine-tune-l4.yaml | kubectl apply --filename = - --namespace = llm
Verify that your Deployments are running. To check
the status of the Workload objects, run the following command:
kubectl get workloads --namespace = llm
The output should look similar to the following:
NAME QUEUE RESERVED IN ADMITTED FINISHED AGE
job-finetune-gemma-l4-3316f lq cluster-queue True 29m
pod-tgi-gemma-deployment-6cb95cc7f5-cbxg2-d9fe7 lq cluster-queue True 68m
Next, view the Pods in the llm namespace by running this command:
kubectl get pod --namespace = llm
The output should look similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
finetune-gemma-l4-0-vcxpz 2/2 Running 0 31m
finetune-gemma-l4-1-9ppt9 2/2 Running 0 31m
tgi-gemma-deployment-6cb95cc7f5-cbxg2 1/1 Running 0 70m
The output shows that Kueue admits both your fine-tune Job and inference
server Pods to run, reserving the correct resources based on your specified
quota limits.
View the output logs to verify that your fine-tuning Job saves checkpoints to
the Cloud Storage bucket. The fine-tuning Job takes around 10 minutes before
it starts saving the first checkpoint.
kubectl logs --namespace = llm --follow --selector = app = finetune-job
The output for the first saved checkpoint looks similar to the following:
{"name": "finetune", "thread": 133763559483200, "threadName": "MainThread", "processName": "MainProcess", "process": 33, "message": "Fine tuning started", "timestamp": 1731002351.0016131, "level": "INFO", "runtime": 451579.89835739136}
…
{"name": "accelerate.utils.fsdp_utils", "thread": 136658669348672, "threadName": "MainThread", "processName": "MainProcess", "process": 32, "message": "Saving model to /model-data/model-gemma2/experiment/checkpoint-10/pytorch_model_fsdp_0", "timestamp": 1731002386.1763802, "level": "INFO", "runtime": 486753.8924217224}
Test Kueue preemption and dynamic allocation on your mixed workload
In this section, you simulate a scenario where the inference server's load increases, requiring it to scale up. This scenario demonstrates how Kueue prioritizes the
high-priority inference server by suspending and preempting the lower-priority
fine-tuning Job when resources are constrained.
Run the following command to scale the inference server's replicas to two:
kubectl scale --replicas = 2 deployment/tgi-gemma-deployment --namespace = llm
Check the status of the Workload objects:
kubectl get workloads --namespace = llm
The output looks similar to the following:
NAME QUEUE RESERVED IN ADMITTED FINISHED AGE
job-finetune-gemma-l4-3316f lq False 32m
pod-tgi-gemma-deployment-6cb95cc7f5-cbxg2-d9fe7 lq cluster-queue True 70m
pod-tgi-gemma-deployment-6cb95cc7f5-p49sh-167de lq cluster-queue True 14s
The output shows that the fine-tuning Job is no longer admitted because the
increased inference server replicas are using the available GPU quota.
Check the status of the fine-tune Job:
kubectl get job --namespace = llm
The output looks similar to the following, indicating that the fine-tune Job
status is now suspended:
NAME STATUS COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE
finetune-gemma-l4 Suspended 0/2 33m
Run the following command to inspect your Pods:
kubectl get pod --namespace = llm
The output looks similar to the following, indicating that Kueue terminated the
fine-tune Job Pods to free resources for the higher priority inference server
Deployment.
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
tgi-gemma-deployment-6cb95cc7f5-cbxg2 1/1 Running 0 72m
tgi-gemma-deployment-6cb95cc7f5-p49sh 0/1 ContainerCreating 0 91s
Next, test the scenario where the inference server load decreases and its
Pods scale down. Run the following command:
kubectl scale --replicas = 1 deployment/tgi-gemma-deployment --namespace = llm
Run the following command to display the Workload objects:
kubectl get workloads --namespace = llm
The output looks similar to the following, indicating that one of the inference
server Deployments is terminated, and the fine-tune Job is re-admitted.
NAME QUEUE RESERVED IN ADMITTED FINISHED AGE
job-finetune-gemma-l4-3316f lq cluster-queue True 37m
pod-tgi-gemma-deployment-6cb95cc7f5-cbxg2-d9fe7 lq cluster-queue True 75m
Run this command to display the Jobs:
kubectl get job --namespace = llm
The output looks similar to the following, indicating that the fine-tune
Job is running again, resuming from the latest available checkpoint.
NAME STATUS COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE
finetune-gemma-l4 Running 0/2 2m11s 38m
