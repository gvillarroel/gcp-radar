Autopilot
Standard
This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy and manage containerized agentic AI/ML
applications by using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). By combining the Google
Agent Development Kit (ADK) with a self-hosted large language model (LLM) like
Llama 3.1 served by vLLM, you can operationalize AI agents efficiently and at
scale while maintaining full control over the model stack. This tutorial walks you
through the end-to-end process of taking a Python-based agent from development
to production deployment on a GKE Autopilot cluster with GPU acceleration.
This tutorial is intended for Machine learning (ML) engineers, Developers, and
Cloud architects who are interested in using Kubernetes
container orchestration capabilities for serving agentic AI/ML applications. To
learn more about common roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud
content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Note: The approach in this tutorial requires provisioning a GKE cluster with GPU hardware to run the LLM, which is different from the Vertex AI approach, where model inference is handled by Google's managed infrastructure. For more information about the Vertex AI approach, see Deploy an agentic AI application on GKE with the ADK and Vertex AI .
Before you begin, ensure you are familiar with the following:
GKE
Containerization with Docker
Background
This section describes the key technologies used in this tutorial.
Agent Development Kit (ADK)
Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for developing
and deploying AI agents. Although it's optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK doesn't require you to use a specific model or deployment, and is built for compatibility with other frameworks. ADK was designed to make agent development feel more like software development, to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures that range from basic tasks to complex
workflows.
For more information, see the ADK documentation .
GKE managed Kubernetes service
Google Cloud offers a range of services, including GKE,
which is well-suited to deploying and managing AI/ML workloads.
GKE is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying,
scaling, and managing containerized applications. GKE provides
the necessary infrastructure—including scalable resources, distributed computing,
and efficient networking—to handle the computational demands of LLMs.
For more information about key Kubernetes concepts, see Start learning about Kubernetes . For more information about the GKE and how it helps you scale, automate, and manage Kubernetes, see GKE overview .
vLLM
vLLM is a highly optimized open source LLM serving framework that can increase
serving throughput on GPUs, with features such as the following:
Optimized transformer implementation with PagedAttention .
Continuous batching to improve the overall serving throughput.
Tensor parallelism and distributed serving on multiple GPUs.
For more information, see the vLLM documentation .
Objectives
This tutorial shows you how to do the following:
Set up your Google Cloud environment.
Provision a GPU-enabled GKE cluster.
Deploy a Llama 3.1 model by using the vLLM inference server.
Build a container image for your ADK-based agent.
Deploy the agent to the GKE cluster and connect it to the self-hosted LLM.
Test your deployed agent.
Architecture
This tutorial presents a scalable architecture for deploying agentic AI
applications on GKE. The ADK agent application runs on a standard CPU node pool and the self-hosted LLM (Llama 3.1 on vLLM) runs on a GPU-enabled node pool, both within the same GKE cluster.
This architecture separates the agent's application logic from the LLM inference workload, which allows each component to be scaled and managed independently.
Figure 1 : A scalable architecture for deploying agentic AI
on GKE.
The architecture has two core components, each on its own GKE
Deployment:
ADK agent application : your agent's custom-built
business logic and tools (like get_weather ) are in a container image. The image runs on a standard CPU node pool and communicates with the LLM using an internal Kubernetes service.
Self-hosted LLM (Llama 3.1 on vLLM) : the Llama 3.1 model runs on a
dedicated vLLM server on a GPU-enabled node pool. This deployment uses a
public container image ( vllm/vllm-openai:v0.8.5 ) that's configured to
download and serve the specified model from Hugging Face when the container
starts. The agent communicates with this server through a REST API exposed
by the vllm-llama3-service Kubernetes service.
Both the ADK agent and the vLLM deployments run on the same
GKE cluster. This colocation within a single cluster simplifies
networking, management, and deployment while still allowing for specialized
hardware assignment for components of the application.
Costs
This tutorial uses the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
Artifact Registry
Cloud Build

Prepare the environment
This tutorial uses Cloud Shell to manage resources hosted on Google Cloud.
Cloud Shell comes preinstalled with the software you need for this tutorial,
including kubectl , terraform , and the Google Cloud CLI .
To set up your environment with Cloud Shell, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, launch a Cloud Shell session and click
Activate Cloud Shell . This action launches a session in
a Google Cloud console pane.
Set the default environment variables:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION = REGION
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following values:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID .
REGION : the Google Cloud region
(for example, us-east4 ) to provision your
GKE cluster, Artifact Registry, and other regional resources.
Make sure to specify a region that supports L4 GPUs and G2 machine type
instances. To check for region availability, see
GPU regions and zones
in the Compute Engine documentation.
Clone the sample project
From your Cloud Shell terminal, clone the tutorial's sample code repository:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples.git
Navigate to the tutorial directory:
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/ai-ml/adk-vllm
Create and configure Google Cloud resources
To deploy your agent, you first need to provision the necessary Google Cloud
resources. You can create the GKE cluster and Artifact Registry
repository using either the gcloud CLI or Terraform.
gcloud
This section provides gcloud CLI commands to set up your
GKE cluster and Artifact Registry.
Create a GKE cluster : You can deploy your
containerized agentic application in a GKE Autopilot
or Standard cluster. Use an Autopilot
cluster for a fully managed Kubernetes experience. To choose the
GKE mode of operation that best fits your workloads, see
About GKE modes of operation .
Autopilot
In Cloud Shell, run the following command:
gcloud container clusters create-auto CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = $GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION
Replace CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your
GKE cluster.
With Autopilot, GKE automatically provisions
nodes based on your workload's resource requests.
The GPU required for the LLM is requested in the deploy-llm.yaml
manifest by using a nodeSelector .
To add a nodeSelector request the nvidia-l4 GPU, follow these steps:
Open kubernetes-engine-samples/ai-ml/adk-vllm/deploy-llm/deploy-llm.yaml
in an editor.
Add the following nodeSelector under spec.template.spec :
nodeSelector :
cloud.google.com/gke-accelerator : nvidia-l4
Standard
In Cloud Shell, create a Standard cluster by running the following command:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = $GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION
Replace CLUSTER_NAME with the name of
your GKE cluster.
Create a GPU-enabled
node pool
for your cluster by running the following command:
gcloud container node-pools create gpu-node-pool \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = $GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION \
--machine-type = g2-standard-8 \
--accelerator = type = nvidia-l4,count = 1 \
--enable-gvnic
The deploy-llm.yaml file specifies an nvidia-l4 GPU, which is
available in the G2 machine series. For more information about
this machine type, see
GPU machine types
in the Compute Engine documentation.
Create an Artifact Registry repository : Create an Artifact Registry
repository to securely store and manage your agent's Docker container image.
gcloud artifacts repositories create REPO_NAME \
--repository-format = docker \
--location = $GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION
Replace REPO_NAME with the name of the
Artifact Registry repository you want to use (for example, adk-repo ).
Get the repository URL : To verify the full path to
your repository, run this command. You'll use this format to tag your Docker image when you build the agent image.
gcloud artifacts repositories describe REPO_NAME \
--location $GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION
Terraform
This section describes how to use the Terraform configuration included in the
sample repository to provision your Google Cloud resources automatically.
Navigate to the Terraform directory : The \terraform directory
contains all the necessary configuration files to create the
GKE cluster and other required resources.
cd terraform
Create a Terraform variables file : Copy the provided example
variables file ( example_vars.tfvars ) to create your own
vars.tfvars file.
cp example_vars.tfvars vars.tfvars
Open the vars.tfvars file in an editor and replace the placeholder values with your specific configuration. At a minimum, you must replace
PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project ID
and CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your
GKE cluster.
Initialize Terraform : To download the necessary
provider plugins for Google Cloud, run this command.
terraform init
Review the execution plan : This command shows the infrastructure
changes Terraform will make.
terraform plan -var-file = vars.tfvars
Apply the configuration : To create the
resources in your Google Cloud project, execute the Terraform plan. Confirm with yes when prompted.
terraform apply -var-file = vars.tfvars
After you run these commands, Terraform provisions your GKE
cluster and Artifact Registry repository, and configures the necessary
IAM roles and service accounts, including
Workload Identity Federation for GKE.
To learn more about using Terraform, see Provision GKE resources with Terraform .
Configure kubectl to communicate with your cluster
To configure kubectl to communicate with your cluster, run the following
command:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = ${ GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION }
Replace CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your
GKE cluster.
Build the agent image
After you create the infrastructure using either gcloud CLI or
Terraform, follow these steps to build your agent application.
Grant the required IAM role for Cloud Build : The Cloud Build
service requires permissions to push the agent's container image to
Artifact Registry. Grant the roles/artifactregistry.writer role to the
Compute Engine default service account, which is used by Cloud Build.
Construct the email for the Compute Engine default service account:
export PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format = "value(projectNumber)" )
export COMPUTE_SA_EMAIL = ${ PROJECT_NUMBER } -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
Grant the roles/artifactregistry.writer role to the service account:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: ${ COMPUTE_SA_EMAIL } \
--role = roles/artifactregistry.writer
Build and push the agent container image : From the project root
directory ( adk/llama/vllm ), build your Docker image
and push it to your Artifact Registry by running these commands.
export IMAGE_URL = " ${ GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION } -docker.pkg.dev/ ${ PROJECT_ID } / REPO_NAME /adk-agent:latest"
gcloud builds submit --tag $IMAGE_URL
Verify that the image has been pushed : After the build process
completes successfully, verify that your agent's container image
was pushed to Artifact Registry by listing the images in your repository.
gcloud artifacts docker images list ${ GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION } -docker.pkg.dev/ ${ PROJECT_ID } / REPO_NAME
You should see an output that lists the image you just pushed and tagged as
latest .
Deploy the model
After setting up your GKE cluster and building the agent image,
the next step is to deploy the self-hosted Llama 3.1 model to your cluster. To
do this, deploy a pre-configured vLLM inference server that pulls the model
from Hugging Face and serves it internally within the cluster.
Create a Kubernetes secret for Hugging Face credentials : To allow
the GKE cluster to download the gated Llama 3.1 model, you
must provide your
Hugging Face token
as a Kubernetes secret. The deploy-llm.yaml manifest is configured to use
this secret for authentication.
kubectl create secret generic hf-secret \
--from-literal = hf-token-secret = HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN
Replace HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN with your token.
View the manifest : From your project root directory
( adk/llama/vllm ), navigate to the /deploy-llm directory that contains
the model Deployment manifest.
cd deploy-llm
Apply the manifest : Run the following command to apply the
deploy-llm.yaml manifest to your cluster.
kubectl apply -f deploy-llm.yaml
The command creates three Kubernetes resources:
A Deployment that runs the vLLM server, configured to use the
meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model.
A Service named vllm-llama3-service that exposes the vLLM server on an
internal cluster IP address, allowing the ADK agent to communicate with it.
A ConfigMap containing a Jinja chat template required by the Llama 3.1
model.
Verify the model Deployment : The vLLM server pulls the model files
from Hugging Face. This process can take several minutes. You can monitor
the status of the Pod to ensure its readiness.
Wait for the Deployment to become available.
kubectl wait --for = condition = available --timeout = 600s deployment/vllm-llama3-deployment
View the logs from the running Pod to confirm that the server
started successfully.
export LLM_POD = $( kubectl get pods -l app = vllm-llama3 -o jsonpath = '{.items[0].metadata.name}' )
kubectl logs -f $LLM_POD
The deployment is ready when you see log output similar to the following,
indicating the
LLM server has started and the API routes are available:
INFO 07-16 14:15:16 api_server.py:129] Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Send a request directly to the model server to confirm that the
LLM is ready. To do this, open a new Cloud Shell terminal and run the following command to forward the vllm-llama3-service to your local machine:
kubectl port-forward service/vllm-llama3-service 8000 :8000
In another terminal, send a sample request to the model's
API endpoint by using curl . For example:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
"prompt": "Hello!",
"max_tokens": 10
}'
If the command returns a successful JSON response, your LLM is ready.
You can now terminate the port-forward process by returning to its terminal
window and pressing Ctrl+C , then proceed to deploy the agent.
Deploy the agent application
The next step is to deploy the ADK-based agent application.
Navigate to the /deploy-agent directory : From your project root
directory ( adk/llama/vllm ), navigate to the /deploy-agent directory
that contains the agent's source code and deployment manifest.
cd ../deploy-agent
Update the agent deployment manifest :
The sample deploy-agent.yaml manifest file contains a placeholder for
your project ID in the container image URL. You must replace the placeholder
with your Google Cloud project ID.
image : us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID /adk-repo/adk-agent:latest
To perform this substitution in place, you can run the following command:
sed -i "s/<PROJECT_ID>/ $PROJECT_ID /g" deploy-agent.yaml
Make sure the readinessProbe path is set to / instead of /dev-ui .
To perform this substitution in place, you can run the following command:
sed -i "s|path: /dev-ui/|path: /|g" deploy-agent.yaml
Apply the manifest : Run the following command to apply the
deploy-agent.yaml manifest to your cluster.
kubectl apply -f deploy-agent.yaml
This command creates two Kubernetes resources:
A Deployment named adk-agent that runs your custom-built agent
container image.
A Service named adk-agent of type NodePort that exposes the agent
application so it can be accessed for testing.
Verify the agent deployment : Check the status of the Pod to ensure
it is running correctly.
Wait for the Deployment to become available:
kubectl wait --for = condition = available --timeout = 300s deployment/adk-agent
View the logs from the running agent Pod:
export AGENT_POD = $( kubectl get pods -l app = adk-agent -o jsonpath = '{.items[0].metadata.name}' )
kubectl logs -f $AGENT_POD
The deployment is successful when you see log output similar to the following,
indicating that the Uvicorn server is running and ready to accept requests:
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Test your deployed agent
After successfully deploying both the vLLM server and the agent application,
you can test the end-to-end functionality by interacting with the agent's web
UI.
Note: This tutorial uses the LLM to determine which
tool to call based on your prompt, but the tool itself uses
hardcoded mock data for simplicity instead of a live API. The
agent's get_weather tool retrieves weather information
from a predefined dictionary for "paris," "ottawa," and "tokyo,"
instead of a real-time external service.
Forward the agent's service to your local machine : The adk-agent
service is of type NodePort , but the most direct way to access it from
your Cloud Shell environment is to use the
kubectl port-forward command. Create a secure tunnel to the agent's Pod by running this command.
kubectl port-forward $AGENT_POD 8001 :8001
Access the agent's web UI : In Cloud Shell, click the Web
Preview button and select Preview on port 8001 . A new browser tab
opens, displaying the agent's chat interface.
Interact with the agent : Ask the agent a question that will invoke
its get_weather tool. For example:
What's the weather like in Tokyo?
The agent will first call the LLM to understand the intent and identify
the need to use the get_weather tool. Then, it will execute the tool with
"Tokyo" as the parameter. Finally, it will use the tool's output to
generate a response. You should see a response similar to the following:
The weather in Tokyo is 25°C and sunny.
(Optional) Verify the tool call in the logs : You can observe the
agent's interaction with the LLM and the tool execution by viewing the logs
of the respective Pods.
Agent Pod logs : In a new terminal, view the logs of the
adk-agent Pod. You see the tool call and its result.
kubectl logs -f $AGENT_POD
The output shows the tool being called and the result being processed.
LLM Pod logs : View the logs of the vllm-llama3-deployment
Pod to see the incoming request from the agent.
kubectl logs -f $LLM_POD
The logs shows the full prompt sent by the agent to the LLM,
including the system message, your query, and the definition of the
get_weather tool.
After you finish testing, you can terminate the port-forward process
by returning to its terminal window and pressing Ctrl+C .
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the deployed resources
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources that you created in this tutorial, run the following commands:
gcloud
If you used the gcloud CLI to create your resources, run the
following commands to delete the GKE cluster and the
Artifact Registry repository, and return the
service account's permissions to its original state.
gcloud container clusters delete CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = $GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION
gcloud artifacts repositories delete REPO_NAME \
--location = $GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION
gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: ${ COMPUTE_SA_EMAIL } \
--role = roles/artifactregistry.writer
Terraform
If you used Terraform to provision your infrastructure, you can destroy all the
resources by running a single command from within the /terraform directory.
From your project root directory ( adk/llama/vllm ), navigate to the
/terraform directory:
cd terraform
Run this command to remove all resources defined in your Terraform
configuration files:
terraform destroy
