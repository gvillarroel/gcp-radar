Autopilot
Standard
This page provides an overview of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). GKE
is a managed implementation of the Kubernetes open
source container orchestration platform. Kubernetes was developed by Google,
drawing on years of experience operating production workloads at scale on
Borg , Google's in-house cluster
management system. With GKE, you can deploy and operate your own
containerized applications at scale using
Google Cloud's infrastructure.
This page is for Operators and Developers who are
looking for a scalable, automated, managed Kubernetes solution. To learn more about
common roles, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Get started with GKE
You can start exploring GKE in minutes.
You can use GKE's
free tier ,
which lets you get started with Kubernetes without incurring costs for cluster
management.
Get started in Google Cloud console
Try the quickstart to deploy a
containerized web application.
Read the
Autopilot overview ,
which has guidance and resources for planning and operating your platform.
When to use GKE
GKE is ideal if you need a platform that lets you configure the
infrastructure that runs your containerized apps, such as networking, scaling,
hardware, and security. GKE provides the operational power of
Kubernetes while managing many of the underlying components, such as the
control plane and nodes, for you.
Benefits of GKE
The following table describes some of the benefits of using GKE
as your managed Kubernetes platform:
GKE benefits
Platform management
Fully-managed nodes in GKE
Autopilot mode
with built-in hardening and best practice configurations automatically
applied.
Managed upgrade experience with
release channels
to improve security, reliability, and compliance.
Flexible
maintenance windows and exclusions
that let you configure upgrade type and scope
to meet business needs and architecture constraints.
In GKE Standard mode, flexible
node upgrade strategies
to optimize availability and manage disruptions.
Automatic scaling of nodes based on the number of Pods in the
cluster with Autopilot mode or with node auto-provisioning
in Standard mode.
Node auto-repair
to maintain node health and availability.
Fleet-based team management.
Connect gateway .
Manage GKE cluster configuration with Config Sync .
Built-in logging and monitoring .
Google Cloud integrated CI/CD options with
Cloud Build and Cloud Deploy .
Improved security posture
Hardened node operating system for apps: Container-Optimized OS .
Built-in security measures .
Policy Controller .
Automatic upgrades
to new GKE versions.
Integrated security posture monitoring tooling with the
security posture dashboard .
Google Cloud logging and monitoring integrations with
Google Cloud Observability .
Cost optimization
In Autopilot mode, pay only for the compute resources
your running Pods request.
In GKE Standard mode, you pay for all
resources on nodes, regardless of Pod requests.
Save costs by running fault-tolerant workloads, such as batch jobs, on
Spot Pods .
Minimized operational overhead in Autopilot mode because
Google Cloud manages both the
nodes and the control plane.
Reliability and availability
>99% monthly
uptime SLO .
Pod-level SLA in Autopilot clusters because Google manages
the nodes.
Highly-available control plane and worker nodes in
Autopilot mode
and in
regional Standard clusters .
Proactive monitoring and recommendations
to mitigate potential workload disruptions caused by upcoming
deprecations.
Multi-cluster Service capabilities.
Best practice :
Configure the application CI/CD pipeline to use Cloud Build,
Cloud Deploy, and Artifact Registry.
By using managed build and deployment services,
you can optimize for security, scale, and simplicity.
Use cases for GKE
GKE and Kubernetes are used in a variety of industries, including
robotics, healthcare, retail, education, gaming, and financial services. Examples of workloads you can run include:
AI and ML operations
Data processing at scale
Scalable online games platforms
Reliable applications under heavy load
For case studies by industry and application, refer to
Google Cloud customers .
How GKE works
A GKE environment consists of nodes , which are Compute Engine
virtual machines (VMs) , that are grouped together to form a cluster . You
package your apps (also called workloads ) into containers. You deploy sets
of containers as Pods to your nodes. You use the Kubernetes API to interact
with your workloads, including administering, scaling, and monitoring.
Kubernetes clusters have a set of management nodes called the control plane ,
which run system components such as the Kubernetes API server. In
GKE, Google Cloud manages the
control plane and system components for you. In Autopilot mode, which
is the recommended way to run GKE,
Google Cloud also manages your worker nodes.
Google Cloud automatically upgrades
component versions for improved stability and security, which helps ensure high availability and the integrity of data stored in the cluster's
persistent storage.
For more information, refer to
GKE cluster architecture .
Best practice :
If you run your workloads in VMs, consider using
Migrate for GKE to
containerize the workloads without having to rewrite apps or modify source code.
Kubernetes versions and features
GKE automatically upgrades your control plane to new Kubernetes
versions that add new features and improvements in the open source project. The
Kubernetes version selected for auto-upgrades depends on the stable version in
the GKE release channel you select when you create the cluster.
You can also
manually upgrade your control plane
to a different Kubernetes version than the version GKE selects
for an upgrade. For detailed information on versions and upgrades, refer to the
release notes and
GKE versioning and upgrades .
If you use GKE Standard mode and don't enroll in a
release channel, you won't get automatic upgrades.
GKE includes most beta and stable Kubernetes features. You
can use beta APIs in 1.24 and later .
Best practice :
If you want to try less stable Kubernetes features in the alpha stage, use
alpha Standard clusters .
Also, don't enable beta APIs in production clusters, or carefully considering the implications before doing so.
Modes of operation
GKE has the Autopilot and Standard modes of
operation , which offer you different levels of flexibility, responsibility, and
control. If you want more information before you choose a mode, refer to
Choose a GKE mode of operation .
Best practice :
Use the fully
managed Autopilot
mode , in which Google Cloud manages your
nodes for you and provides a workload-focused, cost-optimized, production-ready
experience. Only use Standard mode if you know you have a specific need
to manually manage the node pools and clusters.
