This page explains how feature and API deprecations that are caused by
Kubernetes and other dependencies work with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This
page also includes tables with information about
specific upstream deprecations . To learn how to
view your exposure to upcoming deprecations, see
Viewing deprecation insights and recommendations .
What are Kubernetes deprecations?
GKE clusters are powered by the Kubernetes
open source cluster management system. The feature set of Kubernetes evolves
over time, and just as new features are introduced over time, sometimes a
feature might need to be removed. Or, a feature may graduate
from the Beta phase to the GA phase. Kubernetes deprecation policy
a deprecated feature or API before it is removed.
After its deprecation period, when a feature or API is removed, you can no
longer use it starting with the corresponding GKE minor version.
If a cluster was dependent on a feature or API that was deprecated,
functionality could be impaired.
Deprecations caused by other upstream dependencies
Apart from Kubernetes features and APIs, GKE also provides
features that are powered by other providers, such as Windows node images backed
by Microsoft, and Ubuntu node images backed by Canonical. When these upstream
providers deprecate or end support for a feature, GKE might have
to remove the corresponding feature. The tables on this page also provide
information about upcoming deprecations and removals that are caused by upstream
dependencies apart from Kubernetes.
How Kubernetes deprecations work with GKE
Running applications on GKE involves shared responsibility
between you and GKE.
As a user, you must assess and mitigate any exposure to deprecated features and
APIs that are removed in upcoming Kubernetes minor versions. In the next
sections, learn about how GKE makes this process easier by
detecting usage of deprecated Kubernetes features and APIs, sharing insights
about this usage, and providing recommendations about how to migrate to features
and APIs compatible with upcoming minor versions.
If GKE detects that a cluster is using a feature that is
removed in an upcoming minor version of Kubernetes, automatic cluster upgrades to
the next minor version are paused, and GKE shares a deprecation
insight and recommendation.
Warning: GKE cannot guarantee the detection of all usage of
deprecated features or APIs, and cannot guarantee that upgrades will be paused.
As part of the shared responsibility
model, you must review upcoming deprecations, assess your clusters for exposure,
and mitigate any exposure to deprecations. To ensure that a cluster is not
upgraded, use maintenance exclusions .
What happens when GKE pauses automatic upgrades?
If GKE detects usage of a deprecated feature or API,
GKE pauses automatic upgrades
to prevent your cluster from being upgraded into a broken state. Upgrades to the
next Kubernetes minor version
are paused, but GKE continues to deliver patch upgrades
to the cluster on the current minor version. For example, if a cluster is on
version 1.21.11-gke.1100 and has calls to deprecated APIs that are removed from
version 1.22, GKE pauses the automatic upgrade to version 1.22.
However, GKE does not pause the automatic upgrade to a new patch
version, 1.21.11-gke.1900.
As GKE cannot guarantee that all usage is detected, GKE
cannot guarantee that upgrades are always paused when a deprecated feature or
API is used. To ensure that a cluster is not upgraded, you must use maintenance exclusions .
When does GKE resume automatic upgrades?
Once GKE hasn't detected usage of the deprecated feature or calls
to deprecated APIs for 30 days, the cluster is automatically upgraded if the
next minor version is the auto-upgrade target for your cluster in the cluster's
release channel , and your
cluster doesn't have other factors preventing upgrades such as an active
maintenance exclusion. To see when the minor version becomes an auto-upgrade
target in your cluster's release channel, see the release
schedule
for an estimated date, and the release
notes for the specific announcement. To
get auto-upgrade targets for a specific cluster, see Get information about a
cluster's upgrades .
If GKE continues to detect usage of the deprecated feature on the
cluster, then GKE keeps the cluster on its current minor version
until the version's end of support
date.
The dates for the end of support of minor versions are available in the Release
Schedule . As the end of support date
for a minor version depends on release channel enrollment, ensure that you refer
to the correct date that is reflective of your cluster's release channel:
Release channels other than Extended : If your cluster is enrolled in the
Rapid, Regular, Stable channels or the cluster isn't enrolled in a release
channel, this date is the minor version's end of standard
support .
Extended channel : If your cluster is enrolled in the Extended
channel ,
GKE won't automatically upgrade your cluster from the minor
version until the end of extended
support .
Once this date is reached, the cluster is automatically upgraded to the next
minor version and the cluster environment might be impaired as the removed
feature is still being used. To learn more, read about Automatic upgrades at
the end of support .
Important: After June 30, 2024—when 1.26 reaches end of standard
support —
GKE begins to automatically upgrade clusters still using version
1.26 and deprecated APIs (removed in version 1.27) to version 1.27.
GKE will stop pausing automatic
upgrades
after June 30, 2024 for clusters still using deprecated APIs removed in
version 1.27 . We recommend that
you upgrade your clusters to version 1.27 as soon as possible as
GKE minor versions that have reached end of support will no
longer receive security patches and bug fixes. To learn more about the
GKE minor version lifecycle, see GKE versioning
and support .
What are deprecation insights and recommendations?
If GKE detects that a cluster is using a feature that is removed
in an upcoming minor version of Kubernetes, GKE shares a deprecation insight and recommendation ,
notifying you of your cluster's usage of a deprecated feature. This insight
provides information about last detected usage, and further details depending
on the type of deprecation. To learn about viewing this information, see
Viewing deprecation insights and recommendations .
Assess and mitigate exposure to upcoming Kubernetes deprecations
GKE provides migration guides that instruct you how to migrate
from deprecated features and APIs to those compatible with the upcoming minor
version. For a list of upcoming deprecations and their migration guides, see
Kubernetes deprecations information .
While GKE shares insights about clusters it has detected are
exposed to a deprecation, detection of all exposures to upcoming deprecations is
not guaranteed. For example, if a deprecated feature has not been used in the
last 30 days, GKE does not detect any usage, and an insight and
recommendation is not generated.
You must independently assess your cluster environment's exposure to any
upcoming deprecations before you upgrade your cluster to the next minor version.
You can exercise control over the upgrade process by choosing a release channel , using maintenance windows and exclusions ,
or manually upgrading your clusters
if you have determined that they are not exposed to deprecations on the next
minor version.
Resolving exposure to Kubernetes deprecations
You can take action by reviewing upcoming deprecations .
View deprecation insights and recommendations ,
to assess if your cluster is exposed, and use migration guides to mitigate the
exposure before the last available minor version supporting the feature reaches
its end of support .
After you make changes to stop usage of deprecated APIs or features in your
cluster, GKE waits until it has no longer observed use of
deprecated APIs or features for 30 days, and then unblocks automatic upgrades.
Automatic upgrades proceed according to the
release schedule .
You can also
upgrade your cluster manually
if you've confirmed that the upgrade does not cause disruption to your
cluster environment. You can do this by first creating a test cluster and
checking whether the upgrade causes any disruption. If it does not, you can
manually upgrade your cluster.
When you dismiss a recommendation, you only hide it for all users. Automatic
upgrades remain paused until you migrate out of the deprecated features and
GKE does not detect usage of the deprecated features for 30
consecutive days.
Kubernetes deprecations information
The following sections provide information about ongoing deprecations, including
guides explaining how to migrate to features or APIs compatible with available
Kubernetes minor versions. You can check these tables to see if GKE
detects and reports usage with insights and recommendations .
These tables only provide information about ongoing deprecations, and omit
previously included information for features or APIs that were deprecated with
versions that are significantly past their end of support date.
