Standard
This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Weaviate
vector database cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
Weaviate is an open-source vector database with low-latency
performance and basic support for different media types such as text and images.
It supports semantic search, question answering, and classification. Weaviate is
fully built on Go and it stores both objects and vectors, allowing the use of vector
search, keyword search, and a combination of both as a hybrid search. From an
infrastructure perspective, Weaviate is a cloud-native and fault-tolerant database.
Fault tolerance is delivered by leaderless architecture where each node of the
database
cluster can serve read and write requests which in turn excludes a single point
of failure.
This tutorial is intended for cloud platform administrators and architects ,
ML engineers ,
and MLOps (DevOps) professionals interested in deploying vector database clusters
on GKE.
Benefits
Weaviate offers the following benefits:
Libraries for various programming languages and open API to
integrate with other services.
Horizontal scaling.
A balance between cost-effectiveness and query speed, especially when dealing
with large datasets. You can choose how much data is stored in memory versus on disk.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Plan and deploy GKE infrastructure for Weaviate.
Deploy and configure the Weaviate database in a GKE cluster.
Run a Notebook to generate and store example vector embeddings within your
database, and perform vector-based search queries.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell to
run commands. Cloud Shell is a shell environment for managing
resources hosted on Google Cloud. It comes preinstalled with the
Google Cloud CLI , kubectl ,
Helm and Terraform
command-line tools. If you don't use Cloud Shell, you must install the Google Cloud CLI.
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Cloud Resource Manager, Compute Engine, GKE,
and IAM Service Account Credentials APIs:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com iamcredentials.googleapis.com
Install the Google Cloud CLI.

To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com iamcredentials.googleapis.com
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/compute.securityAdmin, roles/compute.viewer,
roles/container.clusterAdmin, roles/container.admin, roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin, roles/iam.serviceAccountUser, roles/monitoring.viewer
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Set up your environment
To set up your environment with Cloud Shell, follow these steps:
Set environment variables for your project, region, and a Kubernetes
cluster resource prefix:
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX = weaviate
export REGION = us-central1
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud
project ID.
This tutorial uses us-central1 region to create your deployment
resources.
Check the version of Helm:
helm version
Update the version if it's older than 3.13:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
Clone the sample code repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
Navigate to the weaviate directory:
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/databases/weaviate
Create your cluster infrastructure
In this section, you run a Terraform script to create a private, highly-available,
regional GKE cluster to deploy your Weaviate database.
You can choose to deploy Weaviate using a
Standard or Autopilot cluster .
Each has its own advantages and different pricing models.
Autopilot
The following diagram shows an Autopilot GKE cluster
deployed in the project.
To deploy the cluster infrastructure, run the following commands in the Cloud Shell:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = terraform/gke-autopilot init
terraform -chdir = terraform/gke-autopilot apply \
-var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
GKE replaces the following variables at runtime:
GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN uses the gcloud auth print-access-token
command to retrieve an access token that authenticates interactions with
various Google Cloud APIs
PROJECT_ID , REGION , and KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX are the environment
variables defined in the Set up your environment section and assigned
to the new relevant variables for the Autopilot cluster you are creating.
When prompted, type yes .
The output is similar to the following:
...
Apply complete! Resources: 9 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Outputs:
kubectl_connection_command = "gcloud container clusters get-credentials weaviate-cluster --region us-central1"
Terraform creates the following resources:
A custom VPC network and private subnet for the Kubernetes nodes.
A Cloud Router to access the internet through Network Address Translation (NAT).
A private GKE cluster in the us-central1 region.
A ServiceAccount with logging and monitoring permissions for the cluster.
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus configuration for
cluster monitoring and alerting.
Standard
The following diagram shows a Standard private regional GKE cluster deployed
across three different zones.
To deploy the cluster infrastructure, run the following commands in the Cloud Shell:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = terraform/gke-standard init
terraform -chdir = terraform/gke-standard apply \
-var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
GKE replaces the following variables at runtime:
GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN uses the gcloud auth print-access-token
command to retrieve an access token that authenticates interactions with
various Google Cloud APIs.
PROJECT_ID , REGION , and KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX are the environment variables
defined in Set up your environment section and assigned to the new
relevant variables for the Standard cluster that you are creating.
When prompted, type yes . It might take several minutes for these commands to
complete and for the cluster to show a ready status.
The output is similar to the following:
...
Apply complete! Resources: 10 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Outputs:
kubectl_connection_command = "gcloud container clusters get-credentials weaviate-cluster --region us-central1"
Terraform creates the following resources:
A custom VPC network and private subnet for the Kubernetes nodes.
A Cloud Router to access the internet through Network Address Translation (NAT).
A private GKE cluster in the us-central1 region with autoscaling enabled
(one to two nodes per zone).
A ServiceAccount with logging and monitoring permissions for the cluster.
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus configuration for cluster monitoring and alerting.
Connect to the cluster
Configure kubectl to fetch credentials and communicate with your new GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials \
${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster --location ${ REGION }
Deploy the Weaviate database to your cluster
To use Helm chart to deploy the Weaviate database to your GKE cluster, follow
these steps:
Add the Weaviate database Helm Chart repository before you can deploy it on your
GKE cluster:
helm repo add weaviate https://weaviate.github.io/weaviate-helm
Create the namespace weaviate for the database:
kubectl create ns weaviate
Create a secret to store the API key:
kubectl create secret generic apikeys --from-literal = AUTHENTICATION_APIKEY_ALLOWED_KEYS = $( openssl rand -base64 32 ) -n weaviate
Deploy an internal load balancer to access Weaviate from within the virtual network:
kubectl apply -n weaviate -f manifests/05-ilb/ilb.yaml
The ilb.yaml manifest describes the load balancer service:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
metadata :
annotations :
#cloud.google.com/neg: '{"ingress": true}'
networking.gke.io/load-balancer-type : "Internal"
labels :

targetPort : 8080
- name : grpc
port : 50051
protocol : TCP
targetPort : 50051
selector :
app : weaviate
type : LoadBalancer
Apply the manifest to deploy Weaviate cluster:
helm upgrade --install "weaviate" weaviate/weaviate \
--namespace "weaviate" \
--values ./manifests/01-basic-cluster/weaviate_cluster.yaml
The weaviate_cluster.yaml manifest describes the Deployment.
A Deployment is a Kubernetes API object that lets you run multiple replicas of Pods that are distributed among the nodes in a cluster.:

Wait for a few minutes for the Weaviate cluster to fully start.
Check the Deployment status:
kubectl get weaviate -n weaviate --watch
The output is similar to following, if the weaviate database is successfully
deployed:
NAME: weaviate
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Jun 18 13:15:53 2024
NAMESPACE: weaviate
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
Wait for Kubernetes to start the resources:
kubectl wait pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name = weaviate --for condition = Ready --timeout = 300s -n weaviate
Run queries with Vertex AI Colab Enterprise notebook
This section explains how to connect to your Weaviate database using Colab Enterprise.
You can use a dedicated runtime template to deploy to the weaviate-vpc , so the
notebook can communicate with resources in the GKE cluster.
For more information about Vertex AI Colab Enterprise, see
Colab Enterprise documentation .
Create a runtime template
To create a Colab Enterprise runtime template:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Colab Enterprise Runtime Templates
page and make sure your project is selected:
Go to Runtime Templates
Click add_box New Template . The
Create new runtime template page appears.
In the Runtime basics section:
In the Display name field, enter weaviate-connect .
In the Region drop-down list, select us-central1 . It's the same region as your GKE cluster.
In the Configure compute section:
In the Machine type drop-down list, select e2-standard-2 .
In the Disk size field, enter 30 .
In the Networking and security section:
In the Network drop-down list, select the network where your
GKE cluster resides.
In the Subnetwork drop-down list, select a corresponding subnetwork.
Clear the Enable public internet access checkbox.
To finish creating the runtime template, click Create . Your runtime template
appears in the list on the Runtime templates tab.

The notebook contains both code cells and text that describes each code block. Running
a code cell executes its commands and displays an output. You can run the cells
in order, or run individual cells as needed.
View Prometheus metrics for your cluster
The GKE cluster is configured with Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus ,
which enables collection of metrics in the Prometheus format. This service provides
a fully managed solution for monitoring and alerting, allowing for collection, storage,
and analysis of metrics from the cluster and its applications.
The following diagram shows how Prometheus collects metrics for your cluster:
The GKE private cluster in the diagram contains the following components:
Weaviate Pods that expose metrics on the path /metrics and port 2112 .
Prometheus-based collectors that process the metrics from the Weaviate Pods.
A PodMonitoring resource that sends the metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
To export and view the metrics, follow these steps:
Create the PodMonitoring
resource to scrape metrics by labelSelector :
kubectl apply -n weaviate -f manifests/03-prometheus-metrics/pod-monitoring.yaml
The pod-monitoring.yaml manifest describes the PodMonitoring resource:
apiVersion : monitoring.googleapis.com/v1
kind : PodMonitoring
metadata :
name : weaviate
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
app : weaviate
endpoints :
- port : 2112
interval : 30s
path : /metrics
To import a custom Cloud Monitoring dashboard
with the configurations defined in dashboard.json :
gcloud --project " ${ PROJECT_ID } " monitoring dashboards create --config-from-file monitoring/dashboard.json
After the command runs successfully, go to the Cloud Monitoring
Dashboards :
Go to Dashboards overview
From the list of dashboards, open the Weaviate Overview dashboard. It might
take some time to collect and display metrics. The dashboard shows amount of Shards, Vectors and operations latency
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
The easiest way to avoid billing is to delete the project you created for
this tutorial.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
If you deleted the project, your clean up is complete. If you didn't delete the
project, proceed to delete the individual resources.
Delete individual resources
Set environment variables.
export PROJECT_ID = ${ PROJECT_ID }
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX = weaviate
export REGION = us-central1
Run the terraform destroy command:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = terraform/ FOLDER destroy \
-var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
Replace FOLDER with either gke-autopilot or
gke-standard , depending on the type of GKE cluster you created .
When prompted, type yes .
Find all unattached disks:
export disk_list = $( gcloud compute disks list --filter = "-users:* AND labels.name= ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster" --format "value[separator=|](name,region)" )
Delete the disks:
for i in $disk_list ; do
disk_name = $( echo $i | cut -d '|' -f1 )
disk_region = $( echo $i | cut -d '|' -f2 | sed 's|.*/||' )
echo "Deleting $disk_name "
gcloud compute disks delete $disk_name --region $disk_region --quiet
done
Delete the GitHub repository:
rm -r ~/kubernetes-engine-samples/
