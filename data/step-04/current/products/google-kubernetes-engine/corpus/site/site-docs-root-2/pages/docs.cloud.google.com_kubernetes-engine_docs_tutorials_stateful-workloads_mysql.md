Standard
This document is intended for database administrators, cloud architects, and
operations professionals interested in deploying a highly available MySQL
topology on Google Kubernetes Engine.
Follow this tutorial to learn how to deploy a MySQL InnoDB Cluster and a
MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet , in addition to
MySQL Router
middleware on your GKE cluster, and how to perform upgrades.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
Create and deploy a stateful Kubernetes service.
Deploy a MySQL InnoDB Cluster for high availability.
Deploy Router middleware for database operation routing.
Deploy a MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet for disaster tolerance.
Simulate a MySQL cluster failover.
Perform a MySQL version upgrade.
The following sections describe the architecture of the solution you will
build in this tutorial.
MySQL InnoDB Cluster
In your regional GKE cluster, using a StatefulSet, you
deploy a MySQL database instance with the necessary naming and
configuration to create a MySQL InnoDB Cluster. To provide fault tolerance
and high availability, you deploy three database
instance Pods. This ensures that the majority of Pods on different zones are
available at any given time for a successful primary election using a
consensus protocol, and makes your MySQL InnoDB Cluster tolerant of single
zonal failures.
Figure 1 : Example architecture of a single MySQL InnoDB Cluster
Once deployed, you designate
one Pod as the primary instance to serve both read and write operations. The
other two Pods are secondary read-only replicas. If the primary instance
experiences an infrastructure failure, you can promote
one of these two replica Pods to become the primary.
In a separate namespace, you deploy three MySQL Router Pods to provide
connection routing for improved resilience. Instead of directly connecting to
the database service, your applications connect to MySQL Router Pods.
Each Router Pod is aware of the status and purpose of each MySQL InnoDB
Cluster Pod, and routes application operations to the respective healthy Pod.
The routing state is cached in the Router Pods and updated from the cluster
metadata stored on each node of the MySQL InnoDB Cluster. In the case of an
instance failure, the Router adjusts the connection routing to a live instance.
MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet
You can create a MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet from an initial MySQL InnoDB Cluster.
This lets you increase disaster tolerance if the primary cluster is no longer
available.
Figure 2 : Example multi-region ClusterSet architecture
which contains one primary cluster and one replica cluster
If the MySQL InnoDB Cluster primary instance is no longer available, you can promote
a replica cluster in the ClusterSet to primary. When using MySQL Router
middleware, your application does not need to track the health of the primary
database instance. Routing is adjusted to send connections to the new primary
after the election has occurred. However, it is your responsibility to ensure
that applications connecting to your MySQL Router middleware
follow best practices for resilience, so that connections are retried if an
error occurs during cluster failover.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
Compute Engine

Set up your environment
In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell to manage resources hosted on
Google Cloud. Cloud Shell comes preinstalled with Docker and
the kubectl and gcloud CLI.
To use Cloud Shell to set up your environment:
Set environment variables.
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
export CLUSTER_NAME = gkemulti-west
export CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Replace the following values:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID .
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION : the Compute Engine
region of the control plane of your
cluster. For this tutorial, the region is us-west1 . Typically, you want a region that is close to you.
Set the default environment variables.
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set compute/region CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Clone the code repository.
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
Change to the working directory.
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/databases/gke-stateful-mysql/kubernetes
Create a GKE cluster
In this section, you create a
regional GKE cluster .
Unlike a zonal cluster, a regional cluster's control plane is replicated into
several zones, so an outage in a single zone doesn't make the control plane
unavailable.
To create a GKE cluster, follow these steps:
Autopilot
In Cloud Shell, create a GKE Autopilot cluster in
the us-west1 region.
gcloud container clusters create-auto $CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = $CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Get the GKE cluster credentials.
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = $CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Deploy a Service across three zones. This tutorial uses a Kubernetes Deployment. A Deployment is a Kubernetes API object that lets you run multiple replicas of Pods that are distributed among the nodes in a cluster..

kubectl apply -f prepare-for-ha.yaml
By default, Autopilot provisions resources in two zones.
The Deployment defined in prepare-for-ha.yaml ensures that
Autopilot provisions nodes across three zones in your
cluster, by setting replicas:3 , podAntiAffinity with
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution , and
topologyKey: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone" .
Check the status of the Deployment.
kubectl get deployment prepare-three-zone-ha --watch
When you see three Pods in the ready state, cancel this command with
CTRL+C . The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE
prepare-three-zone-ha 0/3 3 0 9s
prepare-three-zone-ha 1/3 3 1 116s
prepare-three-zone-ha 2/3 3 2 119s
prepare-three-zone-ha 3/3 3 3 2m16s
Run this script to validate that your Pods have been deployed across
three zones.
bash ../scripts/inspect_pod_node.sh default
Each line of the output corresponds to a Pod, and the second column
indicates the zone. The output is similar to the following:
gk3-gkemulti-west1-default-pool-eb354e2d-z6mv us-west1-b prepare-three-zone-ha-7885d77d9c-8f7qb

Standard
In Cloud Shell, create a GKE Standard cluster in
the us-west1 region.
gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = $CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--machine-type = "e2-standard-2" \
--disk-type = "pd-standard" \
--num-nodes = "5"
Get the GKE cluster credentials.
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = $CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Deploy MySQL StatefulSets
In this section, you deploy one MySQL
StatefulSet. A StatefulSet is a Kubernetes controller that maintains a persistent unique identity for each of its Pods.
Each StatefulSet
consists of three MySQL replicas.
To deploy the MySQL StatefulSet, follow these steps:
Create a namespace for the StatefulSet.
kubectl create namespace mysql1
Create the MySQL secret.
apiVersion : v1
kind : Secret
metadata :
name : mysql-secret
type : Opaque
data :
password : UGFzc3dvcmQkMTIzNDU2 # Password$123456
admin-password : UGFzc3dvcmQkMTIzNDU2 # Password$123456
kubectl apply -n mysql1 -f secret.yaml
The password is deployed with each Pod, and is used by management scripts
and commands for MySQL InnoDB Cluster and ClusterSet deployment
in this tutorial.
Create the StorageClass.
apiVersion : storage.k8s.io/v1
kind : StorageClass
metadata :
name : fast-storageclass
provisioner : pd.csi.storage.gke.io
volumeBindingMode : WaitForFirstConsumer
reclaimPolicy : Retain
allowVolumeExpansion : true
parameters :
type : pd-balanced
kubectl apply -n mysql1 -f storageclass.yaml
This storage class uses the pd-balanced Persistent Disk type that
balances performance and cost. The volumeBindingMode field is set to
WaitForFirstConsumer meaning that GKE delays provisioning
of a PersistentVolume until the Pod is created. This setting ensures that
the disk is provisioned in the same zone where the Pod is scheduled.
Deploy the StatefulSet of MySQL instance Pods.

kubectl apply -n mysql1 -f c1-mysql.yaml
This command deploys the StatefulSet consisting of three replicas. In this
tutorial, the primary MySQL cluster is deployed across three zones in
us-west1 . The output is similar to the following:
service/mysql created
statefulset.apps/dbc1 created
In this tutorial, the resource limits and requests are set to minimal
values to save cost. When planning for a production workload,
make sure to set these values appropriately for your organization's needs.
Verify the StatefulSet is created successfully.
kubectl get statefulset -n mysql1 --watch
It can take about 10 minutes for the StatefulSet to be ready.
When all three pods are in a ready state, exit the command using Ctrl+C . If
you see PodUnscheduleable errors due to insufficient CPU or memory, wait a
few minutes for the control plane to resize to accommodate the large workload.
The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY AGE
dbc1 1/3 39s
dbc1 2/3 50s
dbc1 3/3 73s
To inspect the placement of your Pods on the GKE cluster nodes,
run this script:
bash ../scripts/inspect_pod_node.sh mysql1 mysql
The output shows the Pod name, the GKE node name, and the
zone where the node is provisioned, and looks similar to the following:
gke-gkemulti-west-5-default-pool-4bcaca65-jch0 us-west1-b dbc1-0
gke-gkemulti-west-5-default-pool-1ac6e8b5-ddjx us-west1-c dbc1-1
gke-gkemulti-west-5-default-pool-1f5baa66-bf8t us-west1-a dbc1-2
The columns in the output represent the hostname, cloud zone, and Pod name,
respectively.
The topologySpreadConstraints policy in the StatefulSet specification
( c1-mysql.yaml ) directs the scheduler to place the Pods evenly across the
failure domain ( topology.kubernetes.io/zone ).
The podAntiAffinity policy enforces the constraint that Pods are required to
not be placed on the same GKE cluster node ( kubernetes.io/hostname ). For the
MySQL instance Pods, this policy results in the Pods being deployed
evenly across the three zones in the Google Cloud region. This placement enables
high availability of the MySQL InnoDB Cluster by placing each database instance
in a separate failure domain.
Prepare the primary MySQL InnoDB Cluster
To configure a MySQL InnoDB Cluster, follow these steps:
In the Cloud Shell terminal, set the group replication
configurations for the MySQL instances to be added to your cluster.
bash ../scripts/c1-clustersetup.sh
POD_ORDINAL_START = ${ 1 :- 0 }
POD_ORDINAL_END = ${ 2 :- 2 }
for i in $( seq ${ POD_ORDINAL_START } ${ POD_ORDINAL_END } ) ; do
echo "Configuring pod mysql1/dbc1- ${ i } "
cat << ' EOF' | kubectl -n mysql1 exec -i dbc1- ${ i } -- bash -c 'mysql -uroot -proot --password=${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}'
INSTALL PLUGIN group_replication SONAME 'group_replication.so' ;
RESET PERSIST IF EXISTS group_replication_ip_allowlist ;
RESET PERSIST IF EXISTS binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking ;
SET @@PERSIST.group_replication_ip_allowlist = 'mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local' ;
SET @@PERSIST.binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking = 'WRITESET' ;
EOF
done
The script will remotely connect into each of the three MySQL instances to
set and persist the following environment variables:
group_replication_ip_allowlist : allows the instance within the cluster
to connect to any instance in the group.
binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking='WRITESET' : allows parallelized
transactions which won't conflict.
In MySQL versions earlier than 8.0.22, use group_replication_ip_whitelist
instead of group_replication_ip_allowlist .
Open a second terminal, so that you do not need to create a shell for each Pod.
Connect to MySQL Shell on the Pod dbc1-0 .
kubectl -n mysql1 exec -it dbc1-0 -- \
/bin/bash \
-c 'mysqlsh --uri="root:$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD@dbc1-0.mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local"'
Verify the MySQL group replication allowlist for connecting to other instances.
\s ql SELECT @@group_replication_ip_allowlist ;
The output is similar to the following:
+----------------------------------+
| @@group_replication_ip_allowlist |
+----------------------------------+
| mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local |
+----------------------------------+
Verify the server-id is unique on each of the instances.
\s ql SELECT @@server_id ;
The output is similar to the following:
+-------------+
| @@server_id |
+-------------+
| 21 |
+-------------+
Configure each instance for MySQL InnoDB Cluster usage and create an
administrator account on each instance.
\j s
dba.configureInstance ( 'root@dbc1-0.mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local' , { password: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" ) ,clusterAdmin: 'icadmin' , clusterAdminPassword: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD" )}) ;
dba.configureInstance ( 'root@dbc1-1.mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local' , { password: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" ) ,clusterAdmin: 'icadmin' , clusterAdminPassword: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD" )}) ;
dba.configureInstance ( 'root@dbc1-2.mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local' , { password: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" ) ,clusterAdmin: 'icadmin' , clusterAdminPassword: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD" )}) ;
All instances must have the same username and password in order for the
MySQL InnoDB Cluster to function properly. Each command produces
output similar to the following:
...
The instance 'dbc1-2.mysql:3306' is valid to be used in an InnoDB cluster.
Cluster admin user 'icadmin'@'%' created.
The instance 'dbc1-2.mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local:3306' is already
ready to be used in an InnoDB cluster.
Successfully enabled parallel appliers.
Verify that the instance is ready to be used in a MySQL InnoDB Cluster.
dba.checkInstanceConfiguration ()
The output is similar to the following:
...
The instance 'dbc1-0.mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local:3306' is valid to be used in an InnoDB cluster.
{
"status": "ok"
}
Optionally, you can connect to each MySQL instance and repeat this command.
For example, run this command to check the status on the
dbc1-1 instance:
kubectl -n mysql1 exec -it dbc1-0 -- \
/bin/bash \
-c 'mysqlsh --uri="root:$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD@dbc1-1.mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local" \
--js --execute "dba.checkInstanceConfiguration()"'
Create the primary MySQL InnoDB Cluster
Next, create the MySQL InnoDB Cluster using the MySQL Admin
createCluster command. Start with the dbc1-0 instance, which will be
the primary instance for the cluster, then add two additional replicas to
the cluster.
To initialize the MySQL InnoDB Cluster, follow these steps:
Create the MySQL InnoDB Cluster.
var cluster = dba.createCluster ( 'mycluster' ) ;
Running the createCluster command triggers these operations:
Deploy the metadata schema.
Verify that the configuration is correct for Group Replication.
Register it as the seed instance of the new cluster.
Create necessary internal accounts, such as the replication user account.
Start Group Replication.
This command initializes a MySQL InnoDB Cluster with the host dbc1-0 as the
primary. The cluster reference is stored in the cluster variable.
The output looks similar to the following:
A new InnoDB cluster will be created on instance 'dbc1-0.mysql:3306'.
Validating instance configuration at dbc1-0.mysql:3306...
This instance reports its own address as dbc1-0.mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local:3306
Instance configuration is suitable.
NOTE: Group Replication will communicate with other instances using
'dbc1-0.mysql:33061'. Use the localAddress
option to override.
Creating InnoDB cluster 'mycluster' on
'dbc1-0.mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local:3306'...
Adding Seed Instance...
Cluster successfully created. Use Cluster.addInstance() to add MySQL
instances.
At least 3 instances are needed for the cluster to be able to withstand
up to one server failure.
Add the second instance to the cluster.
cluster.addInstance ( 'icadmin@dbc1-1.mysql' , { password: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" ) , recoveryMethod: 'clone' }) ;
Add the remaining instance to the cluster.
cluster.addInstance ( 'icadmin@dbc1-2.mysql' , { password: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" ) , recoveryMethod: 'clone' }) ;
The output is similar to the following:
...
The instance 'dbc1-2.mysql:3306' was successfully added to the cluster.
Verify the cluster's status.
cluster.status ()
This command shows the status of the cluster. The topology consists of
three hosts, one primary and two secondary instances. Optionally, you can call
cluster.status({extended:1}) .
The output is similar to the following:
{
"clusterName": "mysql1",
"defaultReplicaSet": {
"name": "default",
"primary": "dbc1-0.mysql:3306",
"ssl": "REQUIRED",
"status": "OK",
"statusText": "Cluster is ONLINE and can tolerate up to ONE failure.",
"topology": {
"dbc1-0.mysql:3306": {
"address": "dbc1-0.mysql:3306",
"memberRole": "PRIMARY",
"mode": "R/W",
"readReplicas": {},
"replicationLag": null,
"role": "HA",
"status": "ONLINE",
"version": "8.0.28"
},
"dbc1-1.mysql:3306": {
"address": "dbc1-1.mysql:3306",
"memberRole": "SECONDARY",
"mode": "R/O",
"readReplicas": {},
"replicationLag": null,
"role": "HA",
"status": "ONLINE",
"version": "8.0.28"
},
"dbc1-2.mysql:3306": {
"address": "dbc1-2.mysql:3306",
"memberRole": "SECONDARY",
"mode": "R/O",
"readReplicas": {},
"replicationLag": null,
"role": "HA",
"status": "ONLINE",
"version": "8.0.28"
}
},
"topologyMode": "Single-Primary"
},
"groupInformationSourceMember": "dbc1-0.mysql:3306"
}
Optionally, you can call cluster.status({extended:1}) to obtain additional
status details.
Create a sample database
To create a sample database, follow these steps:
Create a database and load data into the database.
\s ql
create database loanapplication ;
use loanapplication
CREATE TABLE loan ( loan_id INT unsigned AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, firstname VARCHAR ( 30 ) NOT NULL, lastname VARCHAR ( 30 ) NOT NULL , status VARCHAR ( 30 ) ) ;
Insert sample data into the database. To insert data, you must be connected
to the primary instance of the cluster.
INSERT INTO loan ( firstname, lastname, status ) VALUES ( 'Fred' , 'Flintstone' , 'pending' ) ;
INSERT INTO loan ( firstname, lastname, status ) VALUES ( 'Betty' , 'Rubble' , 'approved' ) ;
Verify that the table contains the three rows inserted in the previous step.
SELECT * FROM loan ;
The output is similar to the following:
+---------+-----------+------------+----------+
| loan_id | firstname | lastname | status |
+---------+-----------+------------+----------+
| 1 | Fred | Flintstone | pending |
| 2 | Betty | Rubble | approved |
+---------+-----------+------------+----------+
2 rows in set (0.0010 sec)
Create a MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet
You can create a MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet to manage replication from your primary
cluster to replica clusters, using a dedicated ClusterSet replication channel.
A MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet provides disaster tolerance for MySQL InnoDB Cluster
deployments by linking a primary MySQL InnoDB Cluster with one or more replicas of
itself in alternate locations, such as multiple zones and multiple regions.
If you closed MySQL Shell, create a new shell by running this
command in a new Cloud Shell terminal:
kubectl -n mysql1 exec -it dbc1-0 -- \
/bin/bash -c 'mysqlsh \
--uri="root:$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD@dbc1-0.mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local"'
To create a MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet, follow these steps:
In your MySQL Shell terminal, obtain a cluster object.
\j s
cluster = dba.getCluster ()
The output is similar to the following:
<Cluster:mycluster>
Initialize a MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet with the existing MySQL InnoDB Cluster
stored in the cluster object as the primary.
clusterset = cluster.createClusterSet ( 'clusterset' )
The output is similar to the following:
A new ClusterSet will be created based on the Cluster 'mycluster'.
* Validating Cluster 'mycluster' for ClusterSet compliance.
* Creating InnoDB ClusterSet 'clusterset' on 'mycluster'...

ClusterSet successfully created. Use ClusterSet.createReplicaCluster() to add Replica Clusters to it.
<ClusterSet:clusterset>
Check the status of your MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet.
clusterset.status ()
The output is similar to the following:
{
"clusters": {
"mycluster": {
"clusterRole": "PRIMARY",
"globalStatus": "OK",
"primary": "dbc1-0.mysql:3306"
}
},
"domainName": "clusterset",
"globalPrimaryInstance": "dbc1-0.mysql:3306",
"primaryCluster": "mycluster",
"status": "HEALTHY",
"statusText": "All Clusters available."
}
Optionally, you can call clusterset.status({extended:1}) to obtain additional
status details, including information about the cluster.
Exit MySQL Shell.

Deploy a MySQL Router
You can deploy a MySQL Router to direct client application traffic to the
proper clusters. Routing is based on the connection port of the application
issuing a database operation:
Writes are routed to the primary Cluster instance in the primary ClusterSet.
Reads can be routed to any instance in the primary Cluster.
When you start a MySQL Router, it is bootstrapped against the
MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet deployment. The MySQL Router instances connected
with the MySQL InnoDB ClusterSet are aware of any controlled switchovers or
emergency failovers and direct traffic to the new primary cluster.
To deploy a MySQL Router, follow these steps:
In the Cloud Shell terminal, deploy the MySQL Router.
kubectl apply -n mysql1 -f c1-router.yaml
The output is similar to the following:
configmap/mysql-router-config created
service/mysql-router created
deployment.apps/mysql-router created
Check the readiness of the MySQL Router deployment.
kubectl -n mysql1 get deployment mysql-router --watch
When all three Pods are ready, the output is similar to the following:
NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE
mysql-router 3/3 3 0 3m36s
If you see a PodUnschedulable error in the console, wait a minute or two
while GKE provisions more nodes. Refresh, and you should see
3/3 OK .
Start MySQL Shell on any member of the existing cluster.
kubectl -n mysql1 exec -it dbc1-0 -- \
/bin/bash -c 'mysqlsh --uri="root:$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD@dbc1-0.mysql"'
This command connects to the dbc1-0 Pod, then starts a shell connected to
the dbc1-0 MySQL instance.
Verify the router configuration.
clusterset = dba.getClusterSet ()
clusterset.listRouters ()
The output is similar to the following:
{
"domainName": "clusterset",
"routers": {
"mysql-router-7cd8585fbc-74pkm::": {
"hostname": "mysql-router-7cd8585fbc-74pkm",
"lastCheckIn": "2022-09-22 23:26:26",
"roPort": 6447,
"roXPort": 6449,
"rwPort": 6446,
"rwXPort": 6448,
"targetCluster": null,
"version": "8.0.27"
},
"mysql-router-7cd8585fbc-824d4::": {
...
},
"mysql-router-7cd8585fbc-v2qxz::": {
...
}
}
}
Exit MySQL Shell.
\q
Run this script to inspect the placement of the MySQL Router Pods.
bash ../scripts/inspect_pod_node.sh mysql1 | sort
The script shows the node and Cloud Zone placement of the all of the Pods in
the mysql1 namespace, where the output is similar to the following:
gke-gkemulti-west-5-default-pool-1ac6e8b5-0h9v us-west1-c mysql-router-6654f985f5-df97q
gke-gkemulti-west-5-default-pool-1ac6e8b5-ddjx us-west1-c dbc1-1
gke-gkemulti-west-5-default-pool-1f5baa66-bf8t us-west1-a dbc1-2
gke-gkemulti-west-5-default-pool-1f5baa66-kt03 us-west1-a mysql-router-6654f985f5-qlfj9
gke-gkemulti-west-5-default-pool-4bcaca65-2l6s us-west1-b mysql-router-6654f985f5-5967d
gke-gkemulti-west-5-default-pool-4bcaca65-jch0 us-west1-b dbc1-0
You can observe that the MySQL Router Pods are distributed equally across
the zones; that is, not placed on the same node as a MySQL Pod, or on
the same node as another MySQL Router Pod.
Manage GKE and MySQL InnoDB Cluster upgrades
Updates for both MySQL and Kubernetes are released on a regular schedule. Follow
operational best practices to update your software environment regularly. By
default, GKE manages cluster and node pool upgrades for you.
Kubernetes and GKE also provide additional features to
facilitate MySQL software upgrades.
Plan for GKE upgrades
You can take proactive steps and set configurations to mitigate risk and
facilitate a smoother cluster upgrade when you are running stateful services,
including:
Standard clusters : Follow GKE best practices for upgrading clusters . Choose an appropriate upgrade strategy to ensure the upgrades happen during the period of the maintenance window:
Choose surge upgrades if cost optimization is important and if your workloads
can tolerate a graceful shutdown in less than 60 minutes.
Choose blue-green upgrades if your workloads are less tolerant of disruptions, and a
temporary cost increase due to higher resource usage is acceptable.
To learn more, see Upgrade a cluster running a stateful workload .
Autopilot clusters are automatically upgraded , based on the release channel you selected.
Use maintenance windows
to ensure upgrades happen when you intend them. Before the maintenance window,
ensure your database backups are successful.
Before allowing traffic to the upgraded MySQL nodes, use Readiness Probes and
Liveness Probes to ensure they are ready for traffic.
Create Probes that assess whether replication is in sync before accepting
traffic. This can be done through custom scripts, depending on the complexity
and scale of your database.
Set a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) policy
When a MySQL InnoDB Cluster is running on GKE, there must be a
sufficient number of instances running at any time to meet the quorum requirement.
In this tutorial, given a MySQL cluster of three instances, two instances must
be available to form a quorum. A PodDisruptionBudget policy allows you to
limit the number of Pods that can be terminated at any given time. This is
useful for both steady state operations of your stateful services and for
cluster upgrades.
To ensure that a limited number of Pods are concurrently disrupted, you set the
PDB for your workload to maxUnavailable: 1 . This ensures that at any point in
the service operation, no more than one Pod is not running.
Note: You can also set the minAvailable value to ensure that a minimum number
of Pods are running. However, if using minAvailable alone, to
guarantee cluster availability, make sure that
the value is increased if the size of the cluster increases. In contrast, the
maxUnavailable value provides quorum protection for the cluster without any
changes; the tradeoff is that only one instance can be disrupted for upgrade at
a time.
The following PodDisruptionBudget policy manifest sets the maximum unavailable
Pods to one for your MySQL application.
apiVersion : policy/v1
kind : PodDisruptionBudget
metadata :
name : mysql-pdb
spec :
maxUnavailable : 1
selector :
matchLabels :
app : mysql
To apply the PDB policy to your cluster, follow these steps:
Apply the PDB policy using kubectl .
kubectl apply -n mysql1 -f mysql-pdb-maxunavailable.yaml
View the status of the PDB.
kubectl get poddisruptionbudgets -n mysql1 mysql-pdb -o yaml
In the status section of the output, see the currentHealthy and desiredHealthy
Pods counts. The output is similar to the following:
status:
...
currentHealthy: 3
desiredHealthy: 2
disruptionsAllowed: 1
expectedPods: 3
...
Plan for MySQL binary upgrades
Kubernetes and GKE provide features to facilitate upgrades for
the MySQL binary. However, you need to perform some operations to prepare for
the upgrades.
Keep the following considerations in mind before you begin the
upgrade process:
Upgrades should first be carried out in a test environment. For production
systems, you should perform further testing in a pre-production environment.
For some binary releases, you cannot downgrade the version once an upgrade
has been performed. Take the time to understand the implications of an upgrade.
Replication sources can replicate to a newer version. However, copying from a
newer to an older version is typically not supported.
Make sure you have a complete database backup before deploying the upgraded version.
Keep in mind the ephemeral nature of Kubernetes Pods. Any configuration state
stored by the Pod that is not on the persistent volume will be lost when the
Pod is redeployed.
For MySQL binary upgrades, use the same PDB, node pool update strategy, and
Probes as described earlier.
In a production environment, you should follow these best practices:
Create a container image with the new version of MySQL.
Persist the image build instructions in a source control repository.
Use an automated image build and testing pipeline such as Cloud Build, and
store the image binary in an image registry such as Artifact Registry.
To keep this tutorial simple, you will not build and persist a container image;
instead, you use the public MySQL images.
Deploy the upgraded MySQL binary
To perform the MySQL binary upgrade, you issue a declarative command that
modifies the image version of the StatefulSet resource. GKE
performs the necessary steps to stop the current Pod, deploy a new Pod with
the upgraded binary, and attach the persistent disk to the new Pod.
Verify that the PDB was created.
kubectl get poddisruptionbudgets -n mysql1
Get the list of stateful sets.
kubectl get statefulsets -n mysql1
Get the list of running Pods using the app label.
kubectl get pods --selector = app = mysql -n mysql1
Update the MySQL image in the stateful set.
kubectl -n mysql1 \
set image statefulset/dbc1 \
mysql = mysql/mysql-server:8.0.30
The output is similar to the following:
statefulset.apps/mysql image updated
Check the status of the terminating Pods and new Pods.
kubectl get pods --selector = app = mysql -n mysql1
Validate the MySQL binary upgrade
During the upgrade, you can verify the status of the rollout, the new Pods,
and the existing Service.
Confirm the upgrade by running the rollout status command.
kubectl rollout status statefulset/dbc1 -n mysql1
The output is similar to the following:
partitioned roll out complete: 3 new pods have been updated...
Confirm the image version by inspecting the stateful set.
kubectl get statefulsets -o wide -n mysql1
The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY AGE CONTAINERS IMAGES
dbc1 3/3 37m mysql mysql/mysql-server:8.0.30
Check the status of the cluster.
kubectl -n mysql1 \
exec -it dbc1-0 -- \
/bin/bash \
-c 'mysqlsh \
--uri="root:$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD@dbc1-1.mysql.mysql1.svc.cluster.local" \
--js \
--execute "print(dba.getClusterSet().status({extended:1})); print(\"\\n\")"'
For each cluster instance, look for the status and version values in the output.
The output is similar to the following:
...
"status": "ONLINE",
"version": "8.0.30"
...
Rollback the last app deployment rollout
Warning: Some binary versions cannot be downgraded. Understand
the implications and constraints before performing a binary upgrade.
When you revert the deployment of an upgraded binary version, the rollout
process is reversed and a new set of Pods is deployed with the previous image
version.
To revert the deployment to the previous working version, use the rollout undo
command:
kubectl rollout undo statefulset/dbc1 -n mysql1
The output is similar to the following:
statefulset.apps/dbc1 rolled back
Scale your database cluster horizontally
To scale your MySQL InnoDB Cluster horizontally, you add additional nodes to the
GKE cluster node pool (only required if you are using Standard),
deploy additional MySQL instances, then add each instance to the existing
MySQL InnoDB Cluster.
Add nodes to your Standard cluster
This operation is not needed if you are using a Autopilot cluster.
To add nodes to your Standard cluster, follow the instructions below for
Cloud Shell or the Google Cloud console. For detailed steps,
see Resize a node pool
gcloud
In Cloud Shell, resize the default node pool to eight instances in each managed
instance group.
gcloud container clusters resize ${ CLUSTER_NAME } \
--node-pool default-pool \
--num-nodes = 8
Console
To add nodes to your Standard cluster:
Open the gkemulti-west1 Cluster page in the Google Cloud console.
Select Nodes , and click on default pool .
Scroll down to Instances groups .
For each instance group, resize the Number of nodes value from 5 to
8 nodes.
Add MySQL Pods to the primary cluster
To deploy additional MySQL Pods to scale your cluster horizontally, follow these steps:
In Cloud Shell, update the number of replicas in the MySQL deployment
from three replicas to five replicas.
kubectl scale -n mysql1 --replicas = 5 -f c1-mysql.yaml
Verify the progress of the deployment.
kubectl -n mysql1 get pods --selector = app = mysql -o wide
To determine whether the Pods are ready, use the --watch flag to watch the
deployment. If you are using Autopilot clusters and see
Pod Unschedulable errors, this might indicate GKE is
provisioning nodes to accommodate the additional Pods.
Configure the group replication settings for the new MySQL instances to add
to the cluster
bash ../scripts/c1-clustersetup.sh 3 4
The script submits the commands to the instances running on the Pods with
ordinals 3 through 4.
Open MySQL Shell.
kubectl -n mysql1 \
exec -it dbc1-0 -- \
/bin/bash \
-c 'mysqlsh \
--uri="root:$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD@dbc1-0.mysql"'
Configure the two new MySQL instances.
dba.configureInstance ( 'root:$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD@dbc1-3.mysql' , { password: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" ) ,clusterAdmin: 'icadmin' , clusterAdminPassword: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD" )}) ;
dba.configureInstance ( 'root:$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD@dbc1-4.mysql' , { password: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" ) ,clusterAdmin: 'icadmin' , clusterAdminPassword: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD" )}) ;
The commands check if the instance is configured properly for MySQL InnoDB Cluster
usage and perform the necessary configuration changes.
Add one of the new instances to the primary cluster.
cluster = dba.getCluster ()
cluster.addInstance ( 'icadmin@dbc1-3.mysql' , { password: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" ) , recoveryMethod: 'clone' }) ;
Add a second new instance to the primary cluster.
cluster.addInstance ( 'icadmin@dbc1-4.mysql' , { password: os.getenv ( "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" ) , recoveryMethod: 'clone' }) ;
Obtain the ClusterSet status, which also includes the Cluster status.
clusterset = dba.getClusterSet ()
clusterset.status ({ extended: 1 })
The output is similar to the following:
"domainName": "clusterset",
"globalPrimaryInstance": "dbc1-0.mysql:3306",
"metadataServer": "dbc1-0.mysql:3306",
"primaryCluster": "mycluster",
"status": "HEALTHY",
"statusText": "All Clusters available."
Exit MySQL Shell.

Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
The easiest way to avoid billing is to delete the project you created for
the tutorial.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
