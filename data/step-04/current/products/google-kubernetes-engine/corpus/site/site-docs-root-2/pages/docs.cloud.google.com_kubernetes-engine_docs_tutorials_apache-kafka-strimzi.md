Standard
The guide shows you how to use the Strimzi
operator to deploy Apache Kafka
clusters.
Kafka is an open-source, distributed messaging system designed to handle
high-volume, high-throughput, and real-time streaming data. It lets you build
streaming data pipelines for reliable data transfer across different systems and
applications, to support processing and analysis tasks.
Operators are software extensions that make use of custom resources to manage
applications and their components. To learn more about the motivation for using
operators, see
Operator pattern
in the open source Kubernetes documentation. The Strimzi operator offers
flexibility in deployment options and lets you use Kubernetes taints and
tolerances to run Kafka on dedicated nodes.
This guide is intended for platform administrators, cloud architects, and
operations professionals interested in deploying Kafka clusters on
GKE.
This solution is a good starting point if you want to learn how to deploy Kafka
clusters using a third-party operator to automate management and reduce errors.

Benefits
Strimzi includes the following benefits:
Strimzi operators provide a simplified and Kubernetes-native approach to
managing Kafka clusters. Strimzi utilizes custom resources that represent
Kafka topics and users, making cluster management much more straightforward
and aligned with Kubernetes best practices.
Strimzi prioritizes security by default by generating certificates for
listeners and supporting secure authentication methods such as
TLS, SCRAM-SHA, and OAuth. Strimzi also handles NetworkPolicies for all Kafka
listeners.
Strimzi doesn't rely on external dependencies. It includes Kafka and
ZooKeeper
clusters with built-in metrics exporters, saving you from dealing with
additional tools. You can also fine-tune broker configurations to meet
specific requirements.
Deployment architecture
A Kafka cluster consists of one or more servers, known as brokers , which
collaborate to manage incoming data streams and facilitate publish-subscribe
messaging for Kafka clients, referred to as consumers .
Every data partition within the Kafka cluster is assigned a leader broker ,
which is responsible for managing all read and write operations to that
partition. The partition can also have one or more follower brokers which
passively replicate the actions of the leader broker.
In a typical setup, ZooKeeper coordinates Kafka clusters by helping choose a
leader among the brokers and ensuring a smooth failover in case of any issues.
You can also deploy Kafka configuration without Zookeeper by activating KRaft
mode, but this method is not considered production-ready by the Strimzi
community because it does not include support for KafkaTopic resources,
credential authentication, and more.
Availability and disaster recovery
This tutorial uses separate
node pools
and
zones
for Kafka and ZooKeeper clusters to ensure high availability and prepare for
disaster recovery.
Using multiple nodes and zones is crucial for achieving a high-available
Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud for the following reasons:
Fault tolerance: Multiple nodes distribute the workload across the
cluster, ensuring that if one node fails, the other nodes can take over the
tasks, preventing downtime and service interruptions.
Scalability: Using multiple nodes helps ensure horizontal scaling can add
or remove nodes as needed, which helps ensure optimal resource allocation and
accommodating increased traffic or workload demands.
High availability: Using multiple zones within a region helps ensure
redundancy and minimizes the risk of a single point of failure. If an
entire availability zone experiences an outage, the cluster can continue
running in other zones, maintaining service availability.
Geographic redundancy: By spanning nodes across regions, the cluster's
data and services are geographically distributed, providing resilience
against natural disasters, power outages, or other local disruptions that
might impact a single zone.
Rolling updates and maintenance: Using multiple zones helps ensure that
rolling updates and maintenance can be performed on individual nodes
without impacting the overall availability of the cluster. This helps
ensure continuous service while allowing for necessary updates and patches
to be applied seamlessly.
Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Google Cloud provides SLAs for
multi-zone deployments, offering a minimum level of uptime and
availability.
Deployment diagram
The following diagram shows a Kafka cluster running on multiple nodes and
zones in a GKE cluster:
In the diagram, the Kafka StrimziPodSet is deployed across three nodes
in three different zones. You can control this configuration by setting the
required Pod
affinity
and
topology spread
rules on the StrimziPodSet custom resource specification.
If one Zone fails, using the recommended configuration, GKE
reschedules Pods on new nodes and replicates data from the remaining replicas,
for both Kafka and Zookeeper.
The following diagram shows a ZooKeeper StrimziPodSet deployed across three
nodes in three different zones:
The StrimziPodSet custom resource
This tutorial uses the
StrimziPodSet
custom resource introduced in version 0.29 of Strimzi instead of StatefulSets .
The StrimziPodSet resources offers enhanced scalability for the cluster and
lets you pass configuration options, allowing you to make more granular changes
to Pods. The StrimziPodSet resource is enabled by default in Strimzi versions
0.35 and later.

Prepare the environment
In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell to manage resources hosted
on Google Cloud. Cloud Shell is preinstalled with the software
you need for this tutorial, including
kubectl , the
gcloud CLI , Helm and
Terraform .
To set up your environment with Cloud Shell, follow these steps:
Launch a Cloud Shell session from the Google Cloud console, by
clicking
Activate Cloud Shell in the
Google Cloud console .
This launches a session in the bottom pane of the Google Cloud console.
Set environment variables:
export PROJECT_ID= PROJECT_ID
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX=kafka
export REGION=us-central1
Replace PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud with your
project ID .
Clone the GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
Change to the working directory:
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/streaming/
Create your cluster infrastructure
In this section, you run a Terraform script to create a private,
highly-available, regional GKE cluster. The following steps allow
public access to the control plane. To restrict access, create a
private cluster .
You can install the operator using a
Standard or Autopilot
cluster.
Standard
The following diagram shows a private regional Standard
GKE cluster deployed across three different zones:
To deploy this infrastructure, run the following commands from the
Cloud Shell:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = kafka/terraform/gke-standard init
terraform -chdir = kafka/terraform/gke-standard apply -var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
When prompted, type yes . It might take several minutes for this command to
complete and for the cluster to show a ready status.
Terraform creates the following resources:
A VPC network and private subnet for the Kubernetes nodes.
A router to access the internet through NAT.
A private GKE cluster in the us-central1 region.
2 node pools with autoscaling enabled (1-2 nodes per zone, 1 node per zone
minimum)
A ServiceAccount with logging and monitoring permissions.
Backup for GKE for disaster recovery.
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus for cluster monitoring.
The output is similar to the following:
...
Apply complete! Resources: 14 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Outputs:
kubectl_connection_command = "gcloud container clusters get-credentials strimzi-cluster --region us-central1"
Autopilot
The following diagram shows a private regional Autopilot
GKE cluster:
To deploy the infrastructure, run the following commands from the
Cloud Shell:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = kafka/terraform/gke-autopilot init
terraform -chdir = kafka/terraform/gke-autopilot apply -var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
When prompted, type yes . It might take several minutes for this command to
complete and for the cluster to show a ready status.
Terraform creates the following resources:
VPC network and private subnet for the Kubernetes nodes.
A router to access the internet through NAT.
A private GKE cluster in the us-central1 region.
A ServiceAccount with logging and monitoring permissions
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus for cluster monitoring.
The output is similar to the following:
...
Apply complete! Resources: 12 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Outputs:
kubectl_connection_command = "gcloud container clusters get-credentials strimzi-cluster --region us-central1"
Connecting to the cluster
Configure kubectl to communicate with the cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster --region ${ REGION }
Deploy the Strimzi operator to your cluster
In this section, you deploy the Strimzi operator using a Helm chart. There are
also
several other ways
to deploy Strimzi.
Add the Strimzi Helm Chart repository:
helm repo add strimzi https://strimzi.io/charts/
Add a namespace for the Strimzi Operator and the Kafka cluster:
kubectl create ns kafka
Deploy the Strimzi cluster operator using Helm:
helm install strimzi-operator strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator -n kafka
To deploy Strimzi Cluster Operator and Kafka clusters to different
namespaces, add the parameter
--set watchNamespaces="{kafka-namespace,kafka-namespace-2,...}" to the
helm command.
Verify that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has been deployed successfully
using Helm:
helm ls -n kafka
The output is similar to the following:
NAME NAMESPACE REVISION UPDATED STATUS CHART APP VERSION
strimzi-operator kafka 1 2023-06-27 11:22:15.850545 +0200 CEST deployed strimzi-kafka-operator-0.35.0 0.35.0
Deploy Kafka
After the operator is deployed to the cluster, you are ready to deploy a Kafka
cluster instance.
In this section, you deploy Kafka in a basic configuration and then try various
advanced configuration scenarios to address availability, security, and
observability requirements.
Basic configuration
The basic configuration for the Kafka instance includes the following
components:
Three replicas of Kafka brokers, with a minimum of two available replicas
required for cluster consistency.
Three replicas of ZooKeeper nodes, forming a cluster.
Two Kafka listeners: one without authentication, and one utilizing TLS
authentication with a certificate generated by Strimzi.
Java MaxHeapSize and MinHeapSize set to 4 GB for Kafka and 2 GB
for ZooKeeper.
CPU resource allocation of 1 CPU request and 2 CPU limits both for Kafka and
ZooKeeper, along with 5 GB memory requests and limits for Kafka
(4 GB for the main service and 0.5 GB for the metrics exporter) and
2.5 GB for ZooKeeper (2 GB for the main service and 0.5 GB for
the metrics exporter).
Entity-operator with the following requests and limits:
tlsSidecar : 100 m/500 m CPU and 128 Mi memory.
topicOperator : 100 m/500 m CPU and 512 Mi memory.
userOperator : 500 m CPU and 2 Gi memory.
100 GB of storage allocated to each Pod using the premium-rwo
storageClass .
Tolerations, nodeAffinities, and podAntiAffinities configured for
each workload, ensuring proper distribution across nodes, utilizing their
respective node pools and different zones.
Communication inside the cluster secured by self-signed certificates:
separate Certificate Authorities (CAs) for cluster and clients (mTLS). You can
also configure to use a different Certificate Authority.
This configuration represents the minimal setup required to create a
production-ready Kafka cluster. The following sections demonstrate custom
configurations to address aspects such as cluster security, Access Control Lists
(ACLs), topic management, certificate management and more.
Create a basic Kafka cluster
Create a new Kafka cluster using the basic configuration:
kubectl apply -n kafka -f kafka-strimzi/manifests/01-basic-cluster/my-cluster.yaml
This command creates a Kafka custom resource of the Strimzi operator that
includes CPU and memory requests and limits, block storage requests, and a
combination of taints and affinities to distribute the provisioned Pods
across Kubernetes nodes.
Wait a few minutes while Kubernetes starts the required workloads:
kubectl wait kafka/my-cluster --for = condition = Ready --timeout = 600s -n kafka
Verify that the Kafka workloads were created:
kubectl get pod,service,deploy,pdb -l = strimzi.io/cluster = my-cluster -n kafka
The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
pod/my-cluster-entity-operator-848698874f-j5m7f 3/3 Running 0 44m
pod/my-cluster-kafka-0 1/1 Running 0 5m

NAME MIN AVAILABLE MAX UNAVAILABLE ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS AGE
poddisruptionbudget.policy/my-cluster-kafka 2 N/A 1 5m
poddisruptionbudget.policy/my-cluster-zookeeper 2 N/A 1 6m
The operator creates the following resources:
Two StrimziPodSets for Kafka and ZooKeeper.
Three Pods for Kafka broker replicas.
Three Pods for ZooKeeper replicas.
Two PodDisruptionBudgets , which helps ensure a minimum availability of two
replicas for cluster consistency.
A Service named my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap , which serves as the bootstrap
server for Kafka clients connecting from within the Kubernetes cluster. All
internal Kafka listeners are available in this Service.
A headless Service named my-cluster-kafka-brokers that enables DNS
resolution of Kafka broker Pod IP addresses directly. This service is used
for inter broker communication.
A Service named my-cluster-zookeeper-client that lets Kafka brokers connect
to ZooKeeper nodes as clients.
A headless Service named my-cluster-zookeeper-nodes that enables DNS
resolution of ZooKeeper Pod IP addresses directly. This service is used to
connect between ZooKeeper replicas.
A Deployment named my-cluster-entity-operator that contains the
topic-operator and user-operator
and facilitates the management of custom resources KafkaTopics and
KafkaUsers .
You can also configure two NetworkPolicies to facilitate connectivity to
Kafka listeners from any Pod and Namespace. These policies would also
restrict connections to ZooKeeper to brokers, and enable communication between
the cluster Pods and internal Service ports exclusive to cluster communication.
Authentication and user management
This section shows you how to enable the authentication and authorization to
secure Kafka Listeners and share credentials with clients.
Strimzi provides a Kubernetes-native method for user management using a separate
User Operator
and its corresponding Kubernetes custom resource,
KafkaUser ,
which defines the user configuration. The user configuration includes settings
for authentication and authorization, and provisions the corresponding user in
Kafka.
Strimzi can create Kafka listeners and users that support several
authentication mechanisms
such as username and password-based authentication (SCRAM-SHA-512) or TLS. You
can also use OAuth 2.0 authentication, which is often considered a better
approach compared to using passwords or certificates for authentication because
of security and external credential management.
Deploy a Kafka cluster
This section shows you how to deploy a Strimzi operator that demonstrates user
management capabilities, including:
A Kafka cluster with password-based authentication (SCRAM-SHA-512)
enabled on one of the listeners.
A KafkaTopic with 3 replicas.
A KafkaUser with an ACL that specifies that user has read and write
permissions to the topic.
Configure your Kafka cluster to use a listener with password-based
SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication on port 9094 and simple authorization:
kubectl apply -n kafka -f kafka-strimzi/manifests/03-auth/my-cluster.yaml
Create a Topic , User and a client Pod to execute commands against
the Kafka cluster:
kubectl apply -n kafka -f kafka-strimzi/manifests/03-auth/topic.yaml
kubectl apply -n kafka -f kafka-strimzi/manifests/03-auth/my-user.yaml
The Secret my-user with the user credentials is mounted to the client
Pod as a
Volume .
These credentials confirm that the user has permissions to publish messages
to the topic using the listener with the password-based authentication
(SCRAM-SHA-512) enabled.
Create a client pod:
kubectl apply -n kafka -f kafka-strimzi/manifests/03-auth/kafkacat.yaml
Wait a few minutes for the client Pod becomes Ready then connect to it:
kubectl wait --for = condition = Ready pod --all -n kafka --timeout = 600s
kubectl exec -it kafkacat -n kafka -- /bin/sh
Produce a new message with my-user credentials and try to consume it:
echo "Message from my-user" | kcat \
-b my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.kafka.svc.cluster.local:9094 \
-X security.protocol = SASL_SSL \
-X sasl.mechanisms = SCRAM-SHA-512 \
-X sasl.username = my-user \
-X sasl.password = $( cat /my-user/password ) \
-t my-topic -P
kcat -b my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.kafka.svc.cluster.local:9094 \
-X security.protocol = SASL_SSL \
-X sasl.mechanisms = SCRAM-SHA-512 \
-X sasl.username = my-user \
-X sasl.password = $( cat /my-user/password ) \
-t my-topic -C
The output is similar to the following:
Message from my-user
% Reached end of topic my-topic [0] at offset 0
% Reached end of topic my-topic [2] at offset 1
% Reached end of topic my-topic [1] at offset 0
Type CTRL+C to stop the consumer process.
Exit the Pod shell
exit
Backups and disaster recovery
Although the Strimzi operator does not offer built-in backup functionality,
you can implement efficient backup strategies by following certain patterns.
You can use
Backup for GKE
to backup:
Kubernetes resource manifests.
Strimzi API custom resources and their definitions extracted from the
Kubernetes API server of the cluster undergoing backup.
Volumes that correspond to PersistentVolumeClaim resources found in the
manifests.
You can also perform a backup of a Kafka cluster that has been deployed using
the Strimzi operator. You should backup:
The Kafka configuration, which includes all custom resources of the
Strimzi API such as KafkaTopics and KafkaUsers .
The data, which is stored in the PersistentVolumes of the Kafka brokers.
Storing Kubernetes resource manifests, including Strimzi configurations, in Git
repositories can eliminate the need for a separate backup for Kafka
configuration, because the resources can be reapplied to a new Kubernetes
cluster when necessary.
To safeguard Kafka data recovery in scenarios where a Kafka server instance, or
a Kubernetes cluster where Kafka is deployed, is lost, we recommend that you
configure the Kubernetes storage class used for provisioning volumes for Kafka
brokers with the reclaimPolicy option set to Retain . We also recommend
that you take
snapshots
of Kafka broker volumes.
The following manifest describes a StorageClass that uses the reclaimPolicy
option Retain :
apiVersion : storage.k8s.io/v1
kind : StorageClass
metadata :
name : premium-rwo-retain
...
reclaimPolicy : Retain
volumeBindingMode : WaitForFirstConsumer
The following example shows the StorageClass added to the spec of a Kafka
cluster custom resource:
# ...
spec :
kafka :
# ...
storage :
type : persistent-claim
size : 100Gi
class : premium-rwo-retain
With this configuration, PersistentVolumes provisioned using the storage
class are not deleted even when the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim is
deleted.
To recover the Kafka instance on a new Kubernetes cluster using the existing
configuration and broker instance data:
Apply the existing Strimzi Kafka custom resources ( Kakfa ,
KafkaTopic , KafkaUser , etc.) to a new Kubernetes cluster
Update the PersistentVolumeClaims with the name of the new Kafka broker
instances to the old PersistentVolumes using the spec.volumeName property
on the PersistentVolumeClaim.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete the individual resources
If you used an existing project and you don't want to delete it, delete the
individual resources.
Set environment variables.
export PROJECT_ID = ${ PROJECT_ID }
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX = kafka
export REGION = us-central1
Run the terraform destroy command:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = kafka/terraform/ FOLDER destroy -var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
Replace FOLDER with either gke-autopilot or
gke-standard .
When prompted, type yes .
Find all unattached disks:
export disk_list = $( gcloud compute disks list --filter = "-users:* AND labels.name= ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster" --format "value[separator=|](name,zone)" )
This step is needed because, by default Strimzi uses the
deleteClaim: false parameter for storage. If you delete the cluster, all
disks remain available.
Delete the disks:
for i in $disk_list ; do
disk_name = $( echo $i | cut -d '|' -f1 )
disk_zone = $( echo $i | cut -d '|' -f2 | sed 's|.*/||' )
echo "Deleting $disk_name "
gcloud compute disks delete $disk_name --zone $disk_zone --quiet
done
