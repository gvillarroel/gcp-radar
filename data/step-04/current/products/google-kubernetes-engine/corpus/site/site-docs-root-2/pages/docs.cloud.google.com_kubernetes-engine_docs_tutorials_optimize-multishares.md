Optimize storage with Filestore Multishares for GKE
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide shows you how to use Filestore multishares for
Google Kubernetes Engine with the GKE Filestore CSI driver.
Before you begin
Before you begin, complete the setup steps needed
to use Filestore.
Enable the GKE Filestore CSI driver ,
version 1.23 or later:
Driver versions 1.23 through 1.26 support up to 10 shares per instance.
Driver versions 1.27 or later support up to 80 shares per instance.
For the latest GKE Filestore CSI driver requirements,
see Access Filestore instances with the Filestore CSI driver .
Use Filestore multishares with multiple applications
This section shows you how to deploy two applications, one Deployment
and one Statefulset , each using
a Filestore multishares StorageClass .
You'll also see how GKE
bin packs
(a process to efficiently pack applications into your GKE nodes)
all volumes in the same underlying Filestore enterprise instance.
Use the GKE-provided StorageClass, enterprise-multishare-rwx ,
to create instances that support up to 10 shares.
If you want to create instances that support up to 80 shares, you'll need
to create a custom StorageClass . For the
purpose of this guide, you will use a StorageClass with a
ten-share-per-instance limit.
After the GKE Filestore CSI driver is enabled,
users can access the GKE-provided multishare StorageClass
enterprise-multishare-rwx with the following configuration. Referencing
this StorageClass, the GKE Filestore CSI driver
uses dynamic volume provisioning
to automatically create Persistent Volumes (PVs) for new Persistent Volume
Claims (PVCs) as GKE workload demand requires:
kubectl describe sc enterprise-multishare-rwx
Name: enterprise-multishare-rwx
IsDefaultClass: No
Annotations: components.gke.io/component-name=filestorecsi,components.gke.io/component-version=0.7.2,components.gke.io/layer=addon
Provisioner: filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
Parameters: instance-storageclass-label=enterprise-multishare-rwx,multishare=true,tier=enterprise
AllowVolumeExpansion: True
MountOptions: <none>
ReclaimPolicy: Delete
VolumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
Events: <none>
Create a custom StorageClass
If you want to take advantage of the latest capacity limit of up to 80 shares per
Filestore instance, create a custom StorageClass based on the following
template:
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
name: csi-filestore-multishare-128
provisioner: filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
parameters:
tier: enterprise
multishare: "true"
max-volume-size: "128Gi"
network: default
allowVolumeExpansion: true
When renaming the StorageClass, consider the following requirements:
The StorageClass name must be a valid DNS subdomain name .
The multishare StorageClass name is also used as an instance label and should
follow label naming guidelines .
If your application requires immediate volume provisioning, include the
Immediate volume binding mode:
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
Use this specification, for example, if you don't want volume provisioning
to be dependent upon pod creation in the GKE cluster.
Beginning as of driver version 1.27, if you want to assign more than 10
shares per instance, include the max-volume-size parameter and assign it one
of the accepted values from the first column:
Maximum volume size (share size)
Maximum number of shares per instance
128 GiB
80
256 GiB
40
512 GiB
20
1024 GiB
10
So for example, adding the key-value pair max-volume-size: "128Gi" ensures
the StorageClass maps up to 80 shares—each ranging from 10 GiB
to 128 GiB in size—to a single 10 TiB enterprise-tier
instance.
This capability is backward compatibility with Filestore instances
created by GKE Filestore CSI driver versions 1.23
through 1.26.
Existing instances can create new PVCs, or shares, with the extended
minimum share size of 10 GiB.
GKE Filestore CSI driver version 1.27, or later,
recognizes legacy enterprise instances and assigns them a default maximum
share size of 1024 GiB (1 TiB). As a result, legacy instances
are limited to a maximum share count of 10 shares per instance.
For more information, see Filestore multishares for GKE .
Create a Deployment with multiple pod replicas using a single PVC.
Create a YAML configuration file similar to the following:
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -

Deploy a Statefulset.
Deploy a second application that shares the underlying Filestore
instance.
To do so, provision 200 GiB of space and validate that it uses the same
underlying Filestore instance as the first application.
You'll then scale the application to nine replicas using 900 GiB in
total (9 replicas using 100 GiB each) and verify that GKE
uses the same Filestore instance by sharing the instance.
Create a YAML configuration file similar to the following:

Expand a PVC and verify the Filestore instance
This section shows you how to expand an existing PVC and verify the
Filestore instance size.
Expand a PVC.
PVCs—backed by shares in a Filestore multishare instance—
can grow to the maximum size specified in the max-volume-size
parameter. To verify this, expand one of the volumes associated with the
Statefulset while the pod is using it.
From the command line, run the following command to check the current PVC
size of replica 0:
kubectl get pvc test-pvc-multishare-web-0 -o json
{

The file will open in the command line. Find the
spec.resources.requests.storage field and update the value to 500Gi .
From the command line, run the following command to see the applied change:
kubectl get pvc test-pvc-multishare-web-0
You should see something similar to the following response:

The Filestore CSI driver accepted the request, first
expanding the underlying Filestore instance, and then expanding
the share backing the PVC.
Specifically, the Filestore CSI driver automatically expanded
the instance to 1536 Gi to accommodate the new share size of 500Gi.
From the command line, run the following instances describe

Dynamic provisioning on a Shared VPC
Filestore CSI driver for GKE supports dynamic
provisioning
of volumes in a service project under a Shared VPC. The following section shows
how to use the Filestore CSI driver to dynamically
provision volumes on Filestore multishare instances in a service
project under a Shared VPC network.
Complete the setup steps
for a Shared VPC network and private service access.
Create a StorageClass to dynamically provision volumes backed by a
Filestore multishares instance on a Shared VPC.
Run the following command to deploy a StorageClass resource:
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
name: csi-filestore-multishare-sharedvpc
provisioner: filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
parameters:
network: "projects/ HOST_PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ SHARED_VPC_NAME "
connect-mode: PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS
tier: enterprise
multishare: "true"
allowVolumeExpansion: true
EOF
where:
HOST_PROJECT_ID is the ID or name of the host project
of the Shared VPC network. For example, my-host-project .
SHARED_VPC_NAME the name of the Shared VPC network .
For example, my-shared-vpc .
If you want to deploy your resource within a reserved IP address range, add
the following line to the parameters used in the command:
reserved-ip-range: RESERVED_NAME
Where RESERVED_NAME is the name of the reserved IP address range
within which a Filestore instance can be provisioned. For example,
filestore-reserved-ip-range . If a reserved IP range is specified, it must be
a named address range instead of a direct CIDR value.
For more information, see Allocate IP address ranges
or Configuring a reserved IP address range .
To see an example of how to create a reserved name using the Google Cloud console,
see Create an IP allocation .
Create a Deployment.
Run the following command to create a Deployment resource:

CMEK-enabled Filestore instances
You can create GKE volumes hosted on CMEK-enabled
Filestore multishare instances. In this section, you'll see how to
setup a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) for your Filestore
instance .
Customer-managed key details can be provided in the StorageClass. Any instance
dynamically created by the Filestore CSI driver, which references
this StorageClass, will have CMEK enabled.
Create a CMEK-enabled StorageClass.

Map PVCs to Filestore instances
Note: Filestore multishare instances are managed using CSI dynamic
provisioning. Instance or share creation can take several minutes to complete.
Once the Filestore resource is created, Kubernetes creates the
associated PV. This means the volume is not visible until the create operation
initiated by the CSI driver completes.
In this section, you'll see how to map your PVCs to your Filestore
instances.
With Filestore multishare instances, each PVC is hosted on a
Filestore instance by the Filestore CSI driver. The
details of the underlying Filestore instance hosting the volume and
the share representing the Kubernetes volume, is captured in the volumeHandle
field of the Persistent Volumes specification. The volume handle format is as
follows:
modeMultishare/<storageclass-prefix>/<project>/<region>/<filestore-instance-name>/<filestore-share-name>
The following kubectl command can be used to quickly determine the mappings
between a PVC, PV, Filestore Instance, and a Filestore
share.
From the command line, run the following command:
kubectl get pv -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"pv="}{.metadata.name}{",pvc="}{.spec.claimRef.name}{",volumeHandle="}{.spec.csi.volumeHandle}{"\n"}{end}'
You should see something similar to the following response:
pv=pvc-67ad9abd-f25e-4130-b7ca-64d28bd29525,pvc=test-pvc-multishare,volumeHandle=modeMultishare/csi-filestore-multishare-sharedvpc/ YOUR_PROJECT_ID /us-central1/fs-2109f680-3f04-4ada-b4bc-2a1c7fc47b88/pvc_67ad9abd_f25e_4130_b7ca_64d28bd29525
pv=pvc-c80f4de0-9916-4957-b8ae-b21206650ac0,pvc=test-pvc-fs-sharedvpc,volumeHandle=modeMultishare/csi-filestore-multishare-sharedvpc/ YOUR_PROJECT_ID /us-central1/fs-2109f680-3f04-4ada-b4bc-2a1c7fc47b88/pvc_c80f4de0_9916_4957_b8ae_b21206650ac0
where:
YOUR_PROJECT_ID is the name of the project
being used. For example, my-project .
Notice that two persistent volumes in the cluster are hosted on a single
Filestore instance.
