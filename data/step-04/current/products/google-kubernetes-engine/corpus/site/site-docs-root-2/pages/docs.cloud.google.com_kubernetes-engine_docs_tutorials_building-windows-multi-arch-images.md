Building Windows Server multi-arch images
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Standard
This tutorial demonstrates how to manage the versioning complexity of building
images that target multiple Windows Server versions. Windows Server containers
have version compatibility requirements
that prevent containers from running on more than one Windows Server host version.
However, Docker on Windows Server supports multi-arch (or multi-platform) container
images that can run across multiple Windows Server versions.
With multi-arch images, you can upgrade your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
Windows Server node pools to your preferred Windows Server
version without rebuilding the image and changing the Pod specs. For example:
GKE version 1.15 supports Windows Server 1809
GKE version 1.16 supports Windows Server 1909
To upgrade from one GKE version to a later version automatically,
you must build multi-arch images for your Windows workloads. Building a
multi-arch image involves building an image for each Windows Server version, and
then building a manifest that references those images for each Windows Server
version. You can build the images manually if you want full control over the
image creation and build process. Alternatively, you can use Cloud Build to
automatically build the Windows Server multi-arch images.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you learn how to create Windows Server multi-arch images manually
or by using Cloud Build.
Build the images manually:
Create 2 Docker images with different versions or types of Windows
Server, for example Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) 2019 and LTSC 2022.
Create a Windows Server VM.
Create a manifest and push it to the registry.
Build the images using Cloud Build:
Prepare your environment by creating a project, enabling APIs, and
granting permissions.
Create an application, Dockerfiles, and build files.
Run a command to build the image.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Compute Engine
Artifact Registry
Cloud Build
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure that you have performed the following tasks:
Install the Google Cloud CLI to run gcloud commands.
Install Docker to build containers.
Install Go to build Windows Server binaries.
This tutorial uses Artifact Registry as the repository. Ensure you have created your Docker repository .
Note: The gcloud commands in this tutorial assume you are using a Linux machine.
Building multi-arch images manually
Warning: The instructions in this
section make use of an experimental feature in Docker
which should not be used in production environments. Consider the implications
of enabling this feature on your systems.
Building multi-arch images manually provides you with the flexibility to build
an image that includes any Windows Server versions that you need. To build a
multi-arch image manually:
Create an LTSC 2019 Docker single-arch image. See details
about creating Docker images in
Deploying a Windows Server application .
For example, us-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/docker-repo/foo:1.0-2019 .
Create an LTSC 2022 Docker single-arch image. For example, us-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/docker-repo/foo:1.0-2022
Create a Windows Server VM, for example version 20H2. See the Quickstart using a Windows Server VM .
Use RDP to connect to the VM.
Open a PowerShell window to run the commands in the next steps.
Enable the docker manifest experimental feature. A Docker manifest is a
list of images to push to a registry:
PS C: \> $env :DOCKER_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL = 'enabled'
Create the multi-arch manifest:
docker manifest create `
REGISTRY_REGION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY /foo:1.0 `
REGISTRY_REGION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY /foo:1.0-2019 `
REGISTRY_REGION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY /foo:1.0-2022 `
Push the newly created multi-arch image manifest to your Artifact Registry repository:
docker manifest push `
REGISTRY_REGION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY /foo:1.0
To ensure that your multi-arch image was built and pushed successfully, navigate to
REGISTRY_REGION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY /foo and click on that image. You'll see the 3 images
inside:
foo:1.0-2019
foo:1.0-2022
foo:1.0-20h2
foo:1.0
Now you can refer to the multi-arch image REGISTRY_REGION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY /foo:1.0 in your
Pod specs. This will let you safely use auto-upgrade for your GKE
Windows node pools.
Building multi-arch images using the Cloud Build gke-windows-builder
To ease the effort of the manual build steps, you can use the gke-windows-builder
based on the OSS gke-windows-builder .
You can use the gke-windows-builder with Cloud Build to build the Windows
Server multi-arch images automatically.
GKE updates the builder to include new supported Windows LTSC
versions when they are released. Another benefit of using the builder is that
you don't have to create your own Windows VM with Powershell to build the
images. The Windows VM is replaced by a Docker container that runs the commands
for you inside Cloud Build.
To help you understand how the builder works, follow this example to build a
"hello world" multi-arch image. These steps can be performed on Linux or Windows
servers.
Preparing the environment
To prepare your environment, complete the following steps:
Create a workspace directory on your work machine, for example:
~/gke-windows-builder/hello-world .
Create or select a project for this tutorial.
Make sure that billing is enabled for your project.
Enable the Compute Engine, Cloud Build and Artifact Registry
APIs for your project. The gke-windows-builder is invoked using
Cloud Build, and the resulting multi-arch container images are pushed to
Artifact Registry. Compute Engine is required for the builder to create
and manage Windows Server VMs.
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
artifactregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com
Grant the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to your Cloud Build service account by using the Google Cloud CLI:
Set variables:
export PROJECT = $( gcloud info --format = 'value(config.project)' )
export MEMBER = $( gcloud projects describe $PROJECT --format 'value(projectNumber)' ) @cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com
Assign roles. These roles are required for the builder to create the Windows Server VMs, to copy the workspace to a Cloud Storage bucket, to configure the networks to build the Docker image and to push resulting image to Artifact Registry:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member = serviceAccount: $MEMBER --role = 'roles/compute.instanceAdmin'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member = serviceAccount: $MEMBER --role = 'roles/iam.serviceAccountUser'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member = serviceAccount: $MEMBER --role = 'roles/compute.networkViewer'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member = serviceAccount: $MEMBER --role = 'roles/storage.admin'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member = serviceAccount: $MEMBER --role = 'roles/artifactregistry.writer'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member = serviceAccount: $MEMBER --role = 'roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor'
Add a firewall rule named allow-winrm-ingress to allow WinRM to connect to
Windows Server VMs to run a Docker build:
Note: The firewall rule name must be allow-winrm-ingress , as
gke-windows-builder uses this particular name to check whether this
firewall rule exists.
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-winrm-ingress --allow = tcp:5986 --direction = INGRESS
Create a Docker repository in Artifact Registry for your project. If you
have never used Docker repositories in Artifact Registry before, complete the
Quickstart for Docker first. Run
this command to create your repository:
gcloud artifacts repositories create REPOSITORY \
--repository-format = docker --location = REGISTRY_REGION \
--description = "Docker repository"
Replace the following:
REPOSITORY : a name such as windows-multi-arch-images .
REGISTRY_REGION : a valid
Artifact Registry location .
Creating the hello.exe binary in your workspace
For this tutorial, create a simple "hello world" application, written
in Go. The code for the sample app is on
GitHub .
Clone the repository containing the sample code for this tutorial to
your local machine by using the following commands:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/windows/windows-multi-arch
The hello.go file prints the words "Hello World":
package main
import "fmt"
func main () {
fmt . Println ( "Hello World!" )
}
Generate the hello.exe binary:
GOOS = windows go build hello.go
You'll see the hello.exe binary in your workspace.
Creating a Dockerfile and build files in your workspace
In this section you use a Dockerfile to build each single-arch Windows
Server image and then use a build file to trigger the Cloud Build. The
build combines the single-arch images into a multi-arch image.
The Dockerfile is a text document that contains instructions for Docker to
build an image. The gke-windows-builder replaces the WINDOWS_VERSION with a specific Windows
Server version to build the image for. For example, the builder will run docker
build -t multi-arch-helloworld:latest_20h2 --build-arg WINDOWS_VERSION=20H2 . on
Windows Server 20H2.
ARG WINDOWS_VERSION =
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:${WINDOWS_VERSION}
COPY hello.exe /hello.exe
USER ContainerUser
ENTRYPOINT [ "hello.exe" ]
In the same directory that contains the Dockerfile , the cloudbuild.yaml
file is your build config file. Replace <REPOSITORY> and
<REGISTRY_REGION> with the name and region for the
Artifact Registry repository that you created in the previous step. At build
time, Cloud Build automatically replaces $PROJECT_ID with your project
ID.
timeout : 3600s
steps :
- name : 'us-docker.pkg.dev/gke-windows-tools/docker-repo/gke-windows-builder:latest'
args :
- --container-image-name
# Replace <REGISTRY_REGION> and <REPOSITORY>.
- '<REGISTRY_REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/<REPOSITORY>/multiarch-helloworld:latest'
# Specify specific variants of images to be built. Or, remove the following 2 lines to default to all available variants.
- --versions
- '20H2,ltsc2019'
Building the image
Now you can build the image and view your logs to verify a successful build.
To build the image, run the following command:
gcloud builds submit --config = cloudbuild.yaml .
Note: This command takes several minutes to complete.
You'll see logs like the following example. The last line in the log shows that
the build succeeded:
Creating temporary tarball archive of 2 file(s) totalling 492 bytes before compression.
Uploading tarball of [.] to [gs:// PROJECT_ID _cloudbuild/source/1600082502.509759-b949721a922d462c94a75da9be9f1181.tgz]

You've just built the image using the build config file and pushed the
image to Artifact Registry at REGISTRY_REGION -docker.pkg.dev/ PROJECT_ID / REPOSITORY /multiarch-helloworld:latest .
Deploying the image
To deploy the multi-arch Windows image onto a cluster, see
Deploying a Windows Server application
to learn how to deploy the image.
Advanced gke-windows-builder usage
You can customize the behavior of the gke-windows-builder by adding flags to the
args section of the cloudbuild.yaml build config file. Some flags for common
behaviors are described in this section, but this is not an exhaustive list; to
see the full list of flags that gke-windows-builder supports, run the following
command on a Linux server or in Cloud
Shell :
docker run -it us-docker.pkg.dev/gke-windows-tools/docker-repo/gke-windows-builder:latest --help
To speed up your builds you can use a larger machine type for the Windows
instances:
- --machineType
- 'n1-standard-8'
Instead of building the image for all Windows versions that GKE
supports, you can choose specific Windows Server versions to build for by using
the --versions flag:
- --versions
- '20H2,ltsc2019'
If your workspace has many files, your image build will be more reliable if you
configure the builder to copy the workspace via Cloud Storage rather than WinRM.
Create a bucket in your project, such as
gs://{your project}_builder , then set the --workspace-bucket flag:
- --workspace-bucket
- '{your project}_builder'
To run the Windows builder instances in a Shared VPC service project, use
these flags that control the instance's network setup:
- --subnetwork-project
- 'shared-vpc-host-project'
- --subnetwork
- 'host-project-subnet-shared-with-service-project'
Clean up
After you finish the tutorial, you can clean up the resources that you created so that they
stop using quota and incurring charges. The following sections describe how to delete or turn off
these resources.
Deleting the image
To delete the multiarch-helloworld images on Artifact Registry, see Deleting images .
Deleting the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
