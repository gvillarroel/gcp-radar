Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.

Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/container.clusterAdmin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
You must own a domain name. The domain name must be no longer than 63
characters. You can use
Cloud Domains
or another registrar.
Prepare the environment
In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell to manage resources hosted
on Google Cloud. Cloud Shell is preinstalled with the software
you need for this tutorial, including
kubectl ,
Helm , and the gcloud CLI .
To set up your environment with Cloud Shell, follow these steps:
Launch a Cloud Shell session from the Google Cloud console, by
clicking
Activate Cloud Shell in the
Google Cloud console .
This launches a session in the bottom pane of the Google Cloud console.
Add a Helm chart repository and update it:
helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co
helm repo update
Clone the GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples.git
Change to the working directory:
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/observability/elastic-stack-tutorial
Create a GKE cluster
Create a GKE cluster with control plane metrics collection
enabled:
gcloud container clusters create-auto elk-stack \
--location = "us-central1" \
--monitoring = "SYSTEM,WORKLOAD,API_SERVER,SCHEDULER,CONTROLLER_MANAGER"
Deploy the ECK operator
Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) is a platform for deploying and managing the
Elastic Stack on Kubernetes clusters.
ECK automates the deployment and management of Elastic Stack clusters,
simplifying the process of setting up and maintaining Elastic Stack on
Kubernetes. It provides a set of Kubernetes custom resources that you can use to
create and configure Elasticsearch, Kibana, Application Performance Management
Server, and other Elastic Stack components in Kubernetes. This lets developers
and DevOps teams configure and manage Elastic Stack clusters at scale.
ECK supports multiple Elasticsearch nodes, automatic application failover,
seamless upgrades, and SSL encryption. ECK also includes features that let you
monitor and troubleshoot Elasticsearch performance.
Note : This tutorial provides instructions for working with this
app: ECKversion 2.8.0. The
instructions might not represent newer versions of the app. For more information, see the
documentation:
ECK .
Install the ECK Helm chart:
helm upgrade --install "elastic-operator" "elastic/eck-operator" \
--version = "2.8.0" \
--create-namespace \
--namespace = "elastic-system" \
--set = "resources.limits.cpu=250m" \
--set = "resources.limits.memory=512Mi" \
--set = "resources.limits.ephemeral-storage=1Gi" \
--set = "resources.requests.cpu=250m" \
--set = "resources.requests.memory=512Mi" \
--set = "resources.requests.ephemeral-storage=1Gi"
Wait for the operator to be ready:
watch kubectl get pods -n elastic-system
The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
elastic-operator-0 1/1 Running 0 31s
When the operator STATUS is Running , return to the command line
by pressing Ctrl+C .
Configure Elastic Stack with ECK
By using Elastic Stack with Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Elastic Agent working in
Fleet mode, you can set up a powerful, scalable, and fully-managed solution for
managing and visualizing data using Kibana.
Kibana is an open source data analytics and visualization tool that lets you
search, analyze and visualize data in Elasticsearch.
Elastic Agent is a lightweight data shipper that collects data from different
sources, such as logs or metrics, and automatically sends it to Elasticsearch.
Elastic Fleet is a mode of operation in which Elastic agents report to a central
fleet server, which handles their configuration and management. The fleet server
simplifies the deployment, configuration, and scaling of Elastic agents, making
it easier to manage large and complex deployments.
Elasticsearch autoscaling is a self-monitoring feature that can report when
additional resources are needed based on an operator-defined policy. For
example, a policy might specify that a certain tier should scale based on
available disk space. Elasticsearch can monitor the disk space and suggest
scaling if it predicts a shortage, although it is still up to the operator to
add the necessary resources. For more information about Elasticsearch
autoscaling see
Autoscaling
in the Elasticsearch documentation.
Configure an Elasticsearch cluster
Elasticsearch provides a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine
designed to store and search large volumes of data quickly and efficiently.
When deploying Elastic Stack on Kubernetes, you should manage the VM settings,
specifically the vm.max_map_count setting , which is required by
Elasticsearch. vm.max_map_count specifies the number of memory areas that a
process can allocate to a file. Elasticsearch must have this value set to at
least 262144 to run optimally. For more information, see
Virtual memory
in the ECK documentation.
Note : This tutorial provides instructions for working with this
app: Elasticversion 8.9.0. The
instructions might not represent newer versions of the app. For more information, see the
documentation:

Configure a load balancer to access Kibana
To access Kibana, create a Kubernetes Ingress object, a Google-managed
certificate, a global IP address, and a DNS Zone.
Create global external IP address:
gcloud compute addresses create "elastic-stack" --global
Create a managed zone and record set in Cloud DNS:
gcloud dns managed-zones create "elk" \
--description = "DNS Zone for Airflow" \
--dns-name = "elk. BASE_DOMAIN " \
--visibility = "public"
gcloud dns record-sets create "elk. BASE_DOMAIN " \
--rrdatas = " $( gcloud compute addresses describe "elastic-stack" --global --format = "value(address)" ) " \
--ttl = "300" \
--type = "A" \
--zone = "elk"
Delegate the DNS zone as a subdomain of the base domain by creating an NS
record set with a name servers list. You can get a list of name servers
using the following command:
gcloud dns record-sets describe elk. BASE_DOMAIN \
--type = "NS" \
--zone = "elk" \
--format = "value(DATA)"

Configure logging and monitoring
Elastic Stack can use the kube-state-metrics exporter to collect cluster-level
metrics.
Install kube-state-metrics:
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install kube-state-metrics prometheus-community/kube-state-metrics --namespace elastic-system
Get the default Kibana elastic user credentials:
kubectl get secret elasticsearch-es-elastic-user -o yaml -n elastic-system -o jsonpath = '{.data.elastic}' | base64 -d
Open https://elk. BASE_DOMAIN in your browser and
login to Kibana with the credentials.
From the menu, select Analytics , then Dashboards .
In the search text field, enter Kubernetes overview and select
Overview dashboard to see base metrics.
Some of the dashboard panels might show no data or error messages because
GKE limits access to some of the control plane endpoints that
Kibana uses to get cluster metrics.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete the individual resources
If you used an existing project and you don't want to delete it, delete the
individual resources.
Delete the Elastic Stack components, ECK operator, and kube-state-metrics:
kubectl --namespace elastic-system delete ingresses.networking.k8s.io elastic-stack
kubectl --namespace elastic-system delete managedcertificates.networking.gke.io elastic-stack
kubectl --namespace elastic-system delete frontendconfigs.networking.gke.io elastic-stack
kubectl --namespace elastic-system delete agents.agent.k8s.elastic.co elastic-agent
kubectl --namespace elastic-system delete agents.agent.k8s.elastic.co fleet-server
kubectl --namespace elastic-system delete kibanas.kibana.k8s.elastic.co kibana
kubectl --namespace elastic-system delete elasticsearches.elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co elasticsearch
kubectl --namespace elastic-system delete daemonsets.apps max-map-count-setter
kubectl --namespace elastic-system delete pvc --selector = 'elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/cluster-name=elasticsearch'
helm --namespace elastic-system uninstall kube-state-metrics
helm --namespace elastic-system uninstall elastic-operator
Delete the DNS record set, IP address, DNS managed zone, and
GKE cluster:
gcloud dns record-sets delete "elk. BASE_DOMAIN " \
--type = "A" \
--zone = "elk" \
--quiet
gcloud compute addresses delete "elastic-stack" \
--global \
--quiet
gcloud dns managed-zones delete "elk" --quiet
gcloud container clusters delete "elk-stack" \
--location = "us-central1" \
--quiet
