Standard
Note : This tutorial provides instructions for working with this
app: Docker. The
instructions might not represent newer versions of the app. For more information, see the
documentation:
Docker .
This tutorial describes how to migrate an application built for nodes using an
x86 (Intel or AMD) processor in a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster to a
multi-architecture (multi-arch) application that runs on either x86 or Arm nodes.
The intended audience for this tutorial is Platform Admins, App Operators, and
App Developers who want to run their existing x86-compatible workloads on Arm.
With GKE clusters, you can run workloads on Arm nodes using the
C4A ,
N4A , or Tau
T2A machine series.
This tutorial uses C4A nodes, which, like N4A and T2A nodes, can run in your
GKE cluster just like any other node using x86 (Intel or AMD)
processors. C4A nodes provide Arm-based consistently high performance for your
workloads.
For more information, see Arm workloads on
GKE .
This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with Kubernetes and Docker. The
tutorial uses Google Kubernetes Engine and Artifact Registry.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you will complete the following tasks:
Store container images with Docker in Artifact Registry.
Deploy an x86-compatible workload to a GKE cluster.
Rebuild an x86-compatible workload to run on Arm.
Add an Arm node pool to an existing cluster.
Deploy an Arm-compatible workload to run on an Arm node.
Build a multi-arch image to run a workload across multiple architectures.
Run workloads across multiple architectures in one GKE cluster.

Launch Cloud Shell
In this tutorial you will use Cloud Shell ,
which is a shell environment for managing resources hosted on
Google Cloud.
Cloud Shell comes preinstalled with the
Google Cloud CLI
and kubectl
command-line tool. The gcloud CLI provides the primary command-line
interface for Google Cloud, and kubectl provides the primary command-line
interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.
Launch Cloud Shell:
Go to the Google Cloud console.
Google Cloud console
From the upper-right corner of the console, click the Activate Cloud Shell button:
A Cloud Shell session appears inside the console.
You use this shell to run gcloud and kubectl commands.
Prepare your environment
In this section, you prepare your environment to follow the tutorial.
Set the default settings for the gcloud CLI
Set environment variables for your project ID, the Compute Engine location for your
cluster, and the name of your new cluster.
Caution: The following environment variables are used throughout the commands of this tutorial. You might need to set the environment variables again if you close the Cloud Shell.
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
export CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION = us-central1-a
export CLUSTER_NAME = my-cluster
Replace PROJECT_ID with the project ID you chose for
this tutorial in the Before you begin section.
In this tutorial, you create resources in us-central1-a. To see a complete list
of where the C4A machine series is available, see Available regions and zones .
Clone the git repository
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
Change your current working directory to the repository cloned in the
previous step:
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/workloads/migrate-x86-app-to-multi-arch/
This repository contains the files you need to complete this tutorial. This tutorial uses Kubernetes Deployments. A Deployment is a Kubernetes API object that lets you run multiple replicas of Pods that are distributed among the nodes in a cluster..
Create a GKE cluster and deploy the x86 application
In the first part of this tutorial, you create a cluster with x86 nodes and
deploy an x86 application. The example application is a service which responds
to HTTP requests. It is built with the Golang programming language.
This setup represents what a typical cluster environment might look like, using
x86-compatible applications and x86 nodes.
Create a GKE cluster
First, create a GKE using nodes with x86 processors. With this
configuration, you create a typical cluster environment to run x86 applications.
Create the cluster:
gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME \
--release-channel = rapid \
--location = $CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--machine-type = e2-standard-2 \
--num-nodes = 1 \
--async
This cluster has autoscaling disabled in order to demonstrate specific
functionality in later steps.
It might take several minutes to finish creating the cluster. The --async
flag lets this operation run in the background while you complete the next
steps.
You can create clusters with only Arm nodes ,
however for this tutorial you will create a cluster with only x86 nodes first to
learn about the process of making x86-only applications compatible with Arm.
Create the Artifact Registry Docker repository
Create a repository in Artifact Registry to store Docker images:
gcloud artifacts repositories create docker-repo \
--repository-format = docker \
--location = us-central1 \
--description = "Docker repository"
Configure the Docker command-line tool to authenticate to this repository in
Artifact Registry:
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
Build the x86 image and push it to Artifact Registry
Build the x86-compatible version of the application:
docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ $PROJECT_ID /docker-repo/x86-hello:v0.0.1 .
Push the image to Artifact Registry:
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ $PROJECT_ID /docker-repo/x86-hello:v0.0.1
Deploy the x86 application
Check that the cluster is ready by running the following script:
echo
echo -ne "Waiting for GKE cluster to finish provisioning"
gke_status = ""
while [ -z $gke_status ] ; do
sleep 2
echo -ne '.'
gke_status = $( gcloud container clusters list --format = "value(STATUS)" --filter = "NAME= $CLUSTER_NAME AND STATUS=RUNNING" )
done
echo
echo "GKE Cluster ' $CLUSTER_NAME ' is $gke_status "
echo
When the cluster is ready, the output should be similar to the following:
GKE Cluster 'my-cluster' is RUNNING
Retrieve the cluster credentials so that kubectl can connect to the
Kubernetes API for the cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME --location $CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION --project $PROJECT_ID
Update the image using kustomize
and deploy the x86 application:
$( cd k8s/overlays/x86 && kustomize edit set image hello = us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ $PROJECT_ID /docker-repo/x86-hello:v0.0.1 )
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/x86
Deploy a Service to expose the application to the Internet:
kubectl apply -f k8s/hello-service.yaml
Check that the external IP address for the Service, hello-service , is finished
provisioning:
echo
echo -ne "Waiting for External IP to be provisioned"
external_ip = ""
while [ -z $external_ip ] ; do
sleep 2
echo -ne '.'
external_ip = $( kubectl get svc hello-service --template = "{{range .status.loadBalancer.ingress}}{{.ip}}{{end}}" )
done
echo
echo "External IP: $external_ip "
echo
After the external IP address is provisioned, the output should be similar to the following:
External IP: 203.0.113.0
Make an HTTP request to test that the deployment works as expected:
curl -w '\n' http:// $external_ip
The output is similar to the following:
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-mwfkd, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
The output shows that this x86-compatible deployment is running on a node in the
default node pool on the amd64 architecture. The nodes in the default node
pool of your cluster have x86 (either Intel or AMD) processors.
Add Arm nodes to the cluster
In the next part of this tutorial, add Arm nodes to your existing cluster. These
nodes are where the Arm-compatible version of your application is deployed when
it's rebuilt to run on Arm.
Checkpoint
So far you've accomplished the following objectives:
create a GKE cluster using x86 nodes.
store an x86-compatible container image with Docker in Artifact Registry.
deploy an x86-compatible workload to a GKE cluster.
You've configured a cluster environment with x86 nodes and an x86-compatible
workload. This configuration is similar to your existing cluster environments
if you don't currently use Arm nodes and Arm-compatible workloads.
Add an Arm node pool to your cluster
Add an Arm node pool to your existing cluster:
gcloud container node-pools create arm-pool \
--cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
--location $CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--machine-type = c4a-standard-2 \
--num-nodes = 1
The c4a-standard-2 machine type is an Arm VM from the C4A machine
series .
You create a node pool with Arm nodes in the same way as creating a node pool
with x86 nodes. After this node pool is created, you will have both x86 nodes
and Arm nodes running in this cluster.
For more information about adding Arm node pools to existing clusters, see Add
an Arm node pool to a GKE
cluster .
Scale up the existing application running on x86-based nodes
Nodes of multiple architecture types can work seamlessly together in one
cluster. GKE doesn't schedule existing workloads running on x86
nodes to Arm nodes in the cluster because a taint is automatically placed on Arm
nodes. You can see this by scaling up your existing application.
Update the workload, scaling it up to 6 replicas:
$( cd k8s/overlays/x86_increase_replicas && kustomize edit set image hello = us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ $PROJECT_ID /docker-repo/x86-hello:v0.0.1 )
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/x86_increase_replicas/
Wait 30 seconds, then run the following command to check the status of the
deployment:
kubectl get pods -l = "app=hello" --field-selector = "status.phase=Pending"
The output should look similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-6tkxd 0/1 Pending 0 40s
x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-k95b7 0/1 Pending 0 40s
x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-kc876 0/1 Pending 0 40s
This output shows Pods with a Pending status as there is no room left on the
x86-based nodes. Since Cluster Autoscaler is disabled and the Arm nodes are
tainted, the workloads will not be deployed on any of the available Arm
nodes. This taint prevents GKE from scheduling x86 workloads
on Arm nodes. To deploy to Arm nodes, you must indicate that the deployment
is compatible with Arm nodes.
Check the Pods that are in the Running state:
kubectl get pods -l = "app=hello" --field-selector = "status.phase=Running" -o wide
The output should look similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES
x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-cjclz 1/1 Running 0 62s 10.100.0.17 gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t <none> <none>
x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-mwfkd 1/1 Running 0 34m 10.100.0.11 gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t <none> <none>
x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-n56rg 1/1 Running 0 62s 10.100.0.16 gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t <none> <none>
In this output, the NODE column indicates that all Pods from the
deployment are running only in the default-pool, meaning that the
x86-compatible Pods are only scheduled to the x86 nodes. The original Pod
that was already scheduled before the creation of the Arm node pool is still
running on the same node.
Run the following command to access the service and see the output:
for i in $( seq 1 6 ) ; do curl -w '\n' http:// $external_ip ; done
The output is similar to the following:
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-cjclz, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-cjclz, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-n56rg, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-n56rg, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-cjclz, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-cjclz, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
This output shows that all Pods serving requests are running on x86 nodes.
Some Pods cannot respond because they are still in the Pending state as there
is no space on the existing x86 nodes and they will not be scheduled to Arm
nodes.
Rebuild your application to run on Arm
In the previous section, you added an Arm node pool to your existing cluster.
However, when you scaled up the existing x86 application, it did not schedule
any of the workloads to the Arm nodes. In this section, you rebuild your application to
be Arm-compatible, so that this application can run on the Arm nodes in the
cluster.
For this example, accomplish these steps by using docker build .
This two-step approach includes:
First stage : Build the code to Arm.
Second stage : Copy the executable to a lean container.
After following these steps, you will have an Arm-compatible image in addition
to the x86-compatible image.
The second step of copying the executable to another container follows one of the
best practices for building a container, which is to build the smallest image
possible.
This tutorial uses an example application built with the Golang programming
language. With Golang, you can cross-compile an application to different
operating systems and CPU platforms by providing environment variables, GOOS and
GOARCH , respectively.
Run cat Dockerfile_arm to see the Dockerfile written for Arm:
#
# Build: 1st stage
#
FROM golang:1.18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod .
COPY hello.go .
RUN GOARCH=arm64 go build -o /hello && \
apk add --update --no-cache file && \
file /hello
The snippet shown here shows just the first stage. In the file, both stages
are included.
In this file, setting GOARCH=arm64 instructs the Go compiler to build the
application for the Arm instruction set. You do not need to set GOOS
because the base image in the first stage is a Linux Alpine image.
Build the code for Arm, and push it to
Artifact Registry:
docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ $PROJECT_ID /docker-repo/arm-hello:v0.0.1 -f Dockerfile_arm .
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ $PROJECT_ID /docker-repo/arm-hello:v0.0.1
Deploy the Arm version of your application
Now that the application is built to run on Arm nodes, you can deploy it to the
Arm nodes in your cluster.
Inspect the add_arm_support.yaml by running
cat k8s/overlays/arm/add_arm_support.yaml :
The output is similar to the following:
nodeSelector:
kubernetes.io/arch: arm64
This nodeSelector specifies that the workload should run only on the Arm
nodes. When you use the nodeSelector , GKE
adds a toleration
that matches the taint on Arm nodes, letting GKE schedule the
workload on those nodes. For more information about setting this field, see
Prepare an Arm workload for
deployment .
Deploy one replica of the Arm-compatible version of the application:
$( cd k8s/overlays/arm && kustomize edit set image hello = us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ $PROJECT_ID /docker-repo/arm-hello:v0.0.1 )
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/arm
Wait 5 seconds, then check that the Arm deployment is answering curl requests:
for i in $( seq 1 6 ) ; do curl -w '\n' http:// $external_ip ; done
The output is similar to the following:
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-n56rg, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-n56rg, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-mwfkd, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-mwfkd, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-arm-pool-e172cff7-shwc, POD:arm-hello-deployment-69b4b6bdcc-n5l28, CPU PLATFORM:linux/arm64
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-default-pool-32019863-b41t, POD:x86-hello-deployment-6b7b456dd5-n56rg, CPU PLATFORM:linux/amd64
This output should include responses from both the x86-compatible
and Arm-compatible applications responding to the curl request.
Build a multi-architecture image to run a workload across architectures
While you can use the strategy described in the previous section and deploy
separate workloads for x86 and Arm, this would require you to maintain and keep
organized two build processes and two container images.
Ideally, you want to build and run your application seamlessly across both x86
and Arm platforms. We recommend this approach. To run your application with one
manifest across multiple architecture platforms, you need to use
multi-architecture (multi-arch) images. For more information about
multi-architecture images, see Build multi-arch images for Arm
workloads .
To use multi-architecture images, you must ensure that your application meets
the following prerequisites:
Your application does not have any architecture platform-specific dependencies.
All dependencies must be built for
multi-architecture or, at minimum, the targeted platforms.
The example application used in this tutorial meets both of these prerequisites.
However, we recommend testing your own applications when building their
multi-arch images before deploying them to production.
Build and push multi-architecture images
You can build multi-arch images with Docker Buildx
if your workload fulfills the following prerequisites:
The base image supports multiple architectures. Check this by running
docker manifest inspect
on the base image and checking the list of architecture platforms. See an
example of how to inspect an image at the end of this section.
The application does not require special build steps for each architecture
platform. If special steps were required, Buildx might not be sufficient. You
would need to have a separate Dockerfile for each platform and create the
manifest manually with docker manifest create .
The example application's base image is Alpine, which supports multiple
architectures. There are also no architecture platform-specific steps, so you
can build the multi-arch image with Buildx.
Inspect the Dockerfile by running cat Dockerfile :
# This is a multi-stage Dockerfile.
# 1st stage builds the app in the target platform
# 2nd stage create a lean image coping the binary from the 1st stage
#
# Build: 1st stage
#
FROM golang:1.18-alpine as builder
ARG BUILDPLATFORM
ARG TARGETPLATFORM
RUN echo "I am running on $BUILDPLATFORM, building for $TARGETPLATFORM"
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod .
COPY hello.go .
RUN go build -o /hello && \
apk add --update --no-cache file && \
file /hello
#
# Release: 2nd stage
#
FROM alpine
WORKDIR /
COPY --from=builder /hello /hello
CMD [ "/hello" ]
This Dockerfile defines two stages: the build stage and release stage. You
use the same Dockerfile used for building the x86 application.
Run the following command to create and use a new docker buildx builder:
docker buildx create --name multiarch --use --bootstrap
Now that you have created this new builder, you can build and push an image
that is compatible with both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 by using the
--platform flag. For each platform provided with the flag, Buildx builds an
image in the target platform. When Buildx builds the linux/arm64 image, it
downloads arm64 base images. In the first stage, it builds the binary on
the arm64 golang:1.18-alpine image for arm64 . In the second stage, the
arm64 Alpine Linux image is downloaded and the binary is copied to a layer
of that image.
Build and push the image:
docker buildx build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ $PROJECT_ID /docker-repo/multiarch-hello:v0.0.1 -f Dockerfile --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push .
The output is similar to the following:
=> [linux/arm64 builder x/x] ..
=> [linux/amd64 builder x/x] ..
This output shows that two images are generated, one for linux/arm64 and
one for linux/amd64 .
Inspect the manifest of your new multi-arch image:
docker manifest inspect us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ $PROJECT_ID /docker-repo/multiarch-hello:v0.0.1
The output is similar to the following:
{
"schemaVersion": 2,
"mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json",
"manifests": [
{
"mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
"size": 739,
"digest": "sha256:dfcf8febd94d61809bca8313850a5af9113ad7d4741edec1362099c9b7d423fc",
"platform": {
"architecture": "amd64",
"os": "linux"
}
},
{
"mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
"size": 739,
"digest": "sha256:90b637d85a93c3dc03fc7a97d1fd640013c3f98c7c362d1156560bbd01f6a419",
"platform": {
"architecture": "arm64",
"os": "linux"
}
}
]
In this output, the manifests section includes two manifests, one with the
amd64 platform architecture, and the other with the arm64 platform
architecture.
When you deploy this container image to your
cluster, GKE automatically downloads only the image that
matches the node's architecture.
Deploy the multi-arch version of your application
Before you deploy the multi-arch image, delete the original workloads:
kubectl delete deploy x86-hello-deployment arm-hello-deployment
Inspect the add_multiarch_support.yaml kustomize overlay by running
cat k8s/overlays/multiarch/add_multiarch_support.yaml :
The output includes the following toleration set:
tolerations:
- key: kubernetes.io/arch
operator: Equal
value: arm64
effect: NoSchedule
This toleration allows the workload to run on the Arm nodes in your cluster,
since the toleration matches the taint set on all Arm nodes. As this workload
can now run on any node in the cluster, only the toleration is needed. With
just the toleration, GKE can schedule the workload to both x86
and Arm nodes. If you want to specify where GKE can schedule
workloads, use node selectors and node affinity rules. For more information
about setting these fields, see Prepare an Arm workload for
deployment .
Deploy the multi-arch container image with 6 replicas:
$( cd k8s/overlays/multiarch && kustomize edit set image hello = us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/ $PROJECT_ID /docker-repo/multiarch-hello:v0.0.1 )
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/multiarch
Wait 10 seconds, then confirm that all of the replicas of the application are
running:
kubectl get pods -l="app=hello" -o wide
The output is similar to the following:

This output includes a NODE column that indicates the Pods are running on
both nodes in the Arm node pool and others in the default (x86) node pool.
Run the following command to access the service and see the output:
for i in $( seq 1 6 ) ; do curl -w '\n' http:// $external_ip ; done
The output is similar to the following:
Hello from NODE:gke-my-cluster-arm-pool-e172cff7-shwc, POD:multiarch-hello-deployment-65bfd784d-7qbkz, CPU PLATFORM:linux/arm64

You should see that Pods running across architecture platforms are answering the
requests.
Note: It is possible that you run this command and receive only responses
from Pods running on one architecture platform. If this occurs, run the
command once or twice more and you should responses from both architecture
platforms.
You built and deployed a multi-arch image to seamlessly run a workload across
multiple architectures.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
After you finish the tutorial, you can clean up the resources that you created
to reduce quota usage and stop billing charges. The following sections
describe how to delete or turn off these resources.
Delete the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Delete the service, cluster, and repository
If you don't want to delete the entire project, delete the cluster and
repository that you created for the tutorial:
Delete the application's Service by running kubectl delete :
kubectl delete service hello-service
This command deletes the Compute Engine load balancer that you created
when you exposed the Deployment.
Delete your cluster by running gcloud container clusters delete :
gcloud container clusters delete $CLUSTER_NAME --location $CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Delete the repository:
gcloud artifacts repositories delete docker-repo —location = us-central1 --async
