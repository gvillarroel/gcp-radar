Autopilot
Standard
This tutorial shows you how to deploy an Elasticsearch
vector database cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
Vector databases
are data stores specifically designed to manage and search through large collections
of high-dimensional vectors. These vectors represent data like text, images, audio,
video or any data that can be numerically encoded. Unlike relational databases
that rely on exact matches, vector databases specialize in finding similar items
or identifying patterns within massive datasets.
Elasticsearch is a vector database that combines search and analytics functionalities.
It comes with an open REST API for managing your cluster, and supports structured
queries, full-text queries, and complex queries. Elasticsearch lets you
perform phrase, similarity, and prefix searches, with autocomplete suggestions.
This tutorial is intended for cloud platform administrators and architects ,
ML engineers , and MLOps
(DevOps) professionals interested in deploying Elasticsearch
database clusters on GKE.
Benefits
Elasticsearch offers the following benefits:
Wide range of libraries for various programming languages and open API to
integrate with other services.
Horizontal scaling, and support for sharding and replication that simplifies
scaling and high availability.
Multi-node cluster balancing for optimal resource utilization.
Container and Kubernetes support for seamless integration into modern
cloud-native environments.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Plan and deploy GKE infrastructure for Elasticsearch.
Deploy and configure Elasticsearch in a GKE cluster.
Deploy the StatefulHA operator
to ensure Elasticsearch high availability.
Run a notebook to generate and store example vector embeddings within your
database, and perform vector-based search queries.
Collect and visualize metrics on a dashboard.
Deployment architecture
In this tutorial, you deploy a highly available regional GKE cluster
for Elasticsearch,
with multiple Kubernetes nodes spread across several availability zones. This
setup helps ensure fault tolerance, scalability, and geographic redundancy. It
allows for rolling updates and maintenance while providing SLAs for uptime and
availability. For more information, see Regional clusters .
When a node becomes unreachable, a Pod on that node is not rescheduled immediately.
With Pods using a StatefulSet, it can take more than eight minutes for application
Pods to be deleted and rescheduled to new nodes.
To address this issue, the StatefulHA operator does the following:
Solves rescheduling lag, handles failover settings and shortens recovery time by using
.forceDeleteStrategy : AfterNodeUnreachable settings.
Helps ensure that the StatefulSet application is using RePD.
Extends GKE with a custom HighAvailabilityApplication resource that's deployed in the same namespace
as Elasticsearch. This enables the StatefulHA
operator to monitor and respond to failover events.
The following diagram shows an Elasticsearch cluster running on multiple nodes and zones
in a GKE cluster:
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE

Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.

Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Set up your environment
To set up your environment with Cloud Shell, follow these steps:
Set environment variables for your project, region, and a Kubernetes
cluster resource prefix:
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX = elasticsearch
export REGION = us-central1
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud
project ID.
This tutorial uses us-central1 region to create your deployment
resources.
Check the version of Helm:
helm version
Update the version if it's older than 3.13:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
Clone the sample code repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
Navigate to the elasticsearch directory to start creating deployment resources:
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/databases/elasticsearch
Create your cluster infrastructure
In this section, you run a Terraform script to create a private, highly-available,
regional GKE cluster to deploy your Elasticsearch database.
You can choose to deploy Elasticsearch using a
Standard or Autopilot cluster .
Each has its own advantages and different pricing models.
Autopilot
The following diagram shows an Autopilot GKE cluster
deployed in the project.
To deploy the cluster infrastructure, run the following commands in the Cloud Shell:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = terraform/gke-autopilot init
terraform -chdir = terraform/gke-autopilot apply \
-var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
GKE replaces the following variables at runtime:
GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN uses the gcloud auth print-access-token
command to retrieve an access token that authenticates interactions with
various Google Cloud APIs
PROJECT_ID , REGION , and KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX are the environment
variables defined in the Set up your environment section and assigned
to the new relevant variables for the Autopilot cluster you are creating.
When prompted, type yes .
The output is similar to the following:
...
Apply complete! Resources: 9 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Outputs:
kubectl_connection_command = "gcloud container clusters get-credentials elasticsearch-cluster --region us-central1"
Terraform creates the following resources:
A custom VPC network and private subnet for the Kubernetes nodes.
A Cloud Router to access the internet through Network Address Translation (NAT).
A private GKE cluster in the us-central1 region.
A ServiceAccount with logging and monitoring permissions for the cluster.
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus configuration for
cluster monitoring and alerting.
Standard
The following diagram shows a Standard private regional GKE cluster deployed
across three different zones.
To deploy the cluster infrastructure, run the following commands in the Cloud Shell:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = terraform/gke-standard init
terraform -chdir = terraform/gke-standard apply \
-var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
GKE replaces the following variables at runtime:
GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN uses the gcloud auth print-access-token
command to retrieve an access token that authenticates interactions with
various Google Cloud APIs.
PROJECT_ID , REGION , and KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX are the environment variables
defined in Set up your environment section and assigned to the new
relevant variables for the Standard cluster that you are creating.
When prompted, type yes . It might take several minutes for these commands to
complete and for the cluster to show a ready status.
The output is similar to the following:
...
Apply complete! Resources: 10 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Outputs:
kubectl_connection_command = "gcloud container clusters get-credentials elasticsearch-cluster --region us-central1"
Terraform creates the following resources:
A custom VPC network and private subnet for the Kubernetes nodes.
A Cloud Router to access the internet through Network Address Translation (NAT).
A private GKE cluster in the us-central1 region with autoscaling enabled
(one to two nodes per zone).
A ServiceAccount with logging and monitoring permissions for the cluster.
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus configuration for cluster monitoring and alerting.
Connect to the cluster
Configure kubectl to fetch credentials and communicate with your new GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials \
${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster --location ${ REGION }
Deploy the Elasticsearch database and StatefulHA operator
In this section, you deploy the Elasticsearch database (in cluster mode) and
StatefulHA operator to your GKE cluster using the ECK Operator Helm Chart .
The Deployment creates a GKE cluster with the following configuration:
Three replicas of the Elasticsearch nodes.
DaemonSet to change virtual memory settings, for optimal Elasticsearch performance. A DaemonSet is a Kubernetes controller that
helps ensure that a copy of a Pod runs on each node in a cluster.
Configuration of NodeAffinity and PodAntiAffinity to ensure proper distribution
across Kubernetes nodes, optimizing the use of node pools and
maximizing availability across different zones.
A Stateful HA operator that manages failover processes and helps ensure
high availability. A StatefulSet is a Kubernetes controller that maintains a persistent unique identity for each of its Pods.
For authentication, the database creates Kubernetes Secrets with authentication
credentials, passwords, and certificates.
To use the Helm chart to deploy the Elasticsearch database, follow these steps:
Enable the StatefulHA add-on :
Autopilot
GKE automatically enables
the StatefulHA add-on at cluster creation.
Standard
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters update ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--update-addons = StatefulHA = ENABLED
It might take 15 minutes for this command to complete and for the cluster
to show a ready status.
Create an Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) Custom Resource Definition (CRD):
kubectl apply -f https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/2.11.1/crds.yaml
Deploy the ECK operator:
kubectl apply -f https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/2.11.1/operator.yaml
Create the namespace elastic for the database:
kubectl create ns elastic

Run queries with Vertex AI Colab Enterprise notebook
This section explains how to generate embeddings into Elasticsearch documents and perform
semantic search queries using the official Elasticsearch Python client in Colab Enterprise
notebook. A document in Elasticsearch is composed of various fields, each paired
with its corresponding value.
For more information about Vertex AI Colab Enterprise, see
Colab Enterprise documentation .
Best practice :
To effectively utilize Elasticsearch, we recommend that you structure your data
into these documents, which are then indexed for search purposes.
In this example, you use a dataset from a CSV file that contains a list of books
in different genres. Elasticsearch serves as a search engine, and the Pod you create
serves as a client querying the Elasticsearch database.
You can use a dedicated runtime template to deploy to the elasticsearch-vpc VPC
(Virtual Private Cloud), so the
notebook can communicate with resources in your GKE cluster.
Create a runtime template
To create a Colab Enterprise runtime template:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Colab Enterprise Runtime Templates
page and make sure your project is selected:
Go to Runtime Templates
Click add_box New Template . The
Create new runtime template page appears.
In the Runtime basics section:
In the Display name field, enter elastic-connect .
In the Region drop-down list, select us-central1 . It's the same region as your GKE cluster.
In the Configure compute section:
In the Machine type drop-down list, select e2-standard-2 .
In the Disk size field, enter 30 .
In the Networking and security section:
In the Network drop-down list, select the network where your
GKE cluster resides.
In the Subnetwork drop-down list, select a corresponding subnetwork.
Clear the Enable public internet access checkbox.
To finish creating the runtime template, click Create . Your runtime template
appears in the list on the Runtime templates tab.
Create a runtime
To create a Colab Enterprise runtime:
In the runtime templates list for the template you just created, in the Actions column,
click more_vert and then
click Create runtime . The Create Vertex AI Runtime pane appears.
To create a runtime based on your template, click Create .
On the Runtimes tab that opens, wait for the status to transition to Healthy .
Import the notebook
To import the notebook in Colab Enterprise:
Go to the My Notebooks tab and click Import . The Import notebooks
pane appears.
In Import source , select URL .
Under Notebook URLs , enter the following link:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/main/databases/elasticsearch/manifests/03-notebook/vector-database.ipynb
Click Import .
Connect to the runtime and run queries
To connect to the runtime and run queries:
In the notebook, next to the Connect button, click arrow_drop_down Additional connection options .
The Connect to Vertex AI Runtime pane appears.
Select Connect to a runtime and then select Connect to an existing Runtime .
Select the runtime that you launched and click Connect .
To run the notebook cells, click the Run cell button next to each code cell.
The notebook contains both code cells and text that describes each code block. Running
a code cell executes its commands and displays an output. You can run the cells
in order, or run individual cells as needed.
View Prometheus metrics for your cluster
The GKE cluster is configured with Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus ,
which enables collection of metrics in the Prometheus format. This service provides
a fully managed solution for monitoring and alerting, allowing for collection, storage,
and analysis of metrics from the cluster and its applications.
The following diagram shows how Prometheus collects metrics for your cluster:
The GKE private cluster in the diagram contains the following components:
Elasticsearch Pods that expose metrics on the path / and port 9114 .
These metrics are provided by the sidecar container named metrics that contains
the elasticsearch_exporter .
Prometheus-based collectors that process the metrics from the Elasticsearch Pod.
A PodMonitoring resource that sends the metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
The cluster configuration defines a sidecar container with metrics exporter in the
Prometheus format:
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
name: elasticsearch-ha
spec:
...
nodeSets:
- name: main
...
podTemplate:

...
env:
- name: ES_USER
value: "elastic"
- name: ES_PASSWORD
valueFrom:
secretKeyRef:
name: elasticsearch-ha-es-elastic-user

To export and view the metrics, follow these steps:
Create the PodMonitoring
resource to scrape metrics by labelSelector :
kubectl apply -n elastic -f manifests/04-prometheus-metrics/pod-monitoring.yaml
The pod-monitoring.yaml manifest describes the PodMonitoring resource:

interval : 30s
path : /metrics
After a few minutes, the built-in dashboard "Elasticsearch Prometheus Overview"
displays.
To view more data-related graphs, import a custom Cloud Monitoring dashboard with the configurations defined in dashboard.json :
gcloud --project " ${ PROJECT_ID } " monitoring dashboards create --config-from-file monitoring/dashboard.json
After the command runs successfully, go to the Cloud Monitoring
Dashboards :
Go to Dashboards overview
From the list of dashboards, open the ElasticSearch Overview dashboard. It might
take 1-2 minutes to collect and display metrics.
The dashboard shows a count of key metrics:
Indexes
Documents and Shards
Pending operations
Running nodes with their health statuses
Back up your cluster configuration
The Backup for GKE
feature lets you schedule regular backups of your entire GKE cluster
configuration, including the deployed workloads and their data.
In this tutorial, you configure a backup plan for your GKE cluster to perform
backups of all workloads, including Secrets and Volumes, every day at 3 AM.
To ensure efficient storage management, backups older than three days are
automatically deleted.
Enable the Backup for GKE feature for your cluster:
gcloud container clusters update ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--update-addons = BackupRestore = ENABLED
Create a backup plan with a daily schedule for all namespaces within the cluster:
gcloud beta container backup-restore backup-plans create ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster-backup \
--project = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--cluster = "projects/ ${ PROJECT_ID } /locations/ ${ REGION } /clusters/ ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster" \
--all-namespaces \
--include-secrets \
--include-volume-data \
--cron-schedule = "0 3 * * *" \
--backup-retain-days = 3
The command uses the relevant environment variables at runtime.
The cluster name's format is relative to your project and region as follows:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /clusters/ CLUSTER_NAME
When prompted, type y. The output is similar to the following:
Create request issued for: [elasticsearch-cluster-backup]
Waiting for operation [projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/operations/operation-1706528750815-610142ffdc9ac-71be4a05-f61c99fc] to complete...⠹
This operation might take a few minutes to complete successfully. After the
execution is complete, the output is similar to the following:
Created backup plan [elasticsearch-cluster-backup].
You can see your newly created backup plan elasticsearch-cluster-backup listed on
the Backup for GKE console.
Go to Backup for GKE
If you want to restore the saved backup configurations, see Restore a backup .
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
The easiest way to avoid billing is to delete the project you created for
this tutorial.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
If you deleted the project, your clean up is complete. If you didn't delete the
project, proceed to delete the individual resources.
Delete individual resources
Set environment variables.
export PROJECT_ID = ${ PROJECT_ID }
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX = elasticsearch
export REGION = us-central1
Run the terraform destroy command:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = terraform/ FOLDER destroy \
-var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
Replace FOLDER with either gke-autopilot or
gke-standard , depending on the type of GKE cluster you created .
When prompted, type yes .
Find all unattached disks:
export disk_list = $( gcloud compute disks list --filter = "-users:* AND labels.name= ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster" --format "value[separator=|](name,region)" )
Delete the disks:
for i in $disk_list ; do
disk_name = $( echo $i | cut -d '|' -f1 )
disk_region = $( echo $i | cut -d '|' -f2 | sed 's|.*/||' )
echo "Deleting $disk_name "
gcloud compute disks delete $disk_name --region $disk_region --quiet
done
Delete the GitHub repository:
rm -r ~/kubernetes-engine-samples/
