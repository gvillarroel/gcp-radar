Standard
This tutorial shows how to run a web application behind an
external Application Load Balancer by configuring the Ingress resource.
Note: This process does not apply to an
NGINX Ingress controller .
This page is for Networking specialists who design and architect the network
for their organization and install, configure, and support network equipment. To
learn more about common roles and example tasks that we reference in
Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Background
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) offers integrated support for two types of
Cloud Load Balancing for a publicly accessible application:
Ingress
External passthrough Network Load Balancer
In this tutorial, you use Ingresses .
Ingress
When you specify kind: Ingress in a resource manifest, you instruct
GKE to create an Ingress resource. By including annotations and
supporting workloads and Services, you can create a custom Ingress controller.
Otherwise, GKE makes appropriate Google Cloud API calls to
create an external Application Load Balancer . The load
balancer's URL map's host rules and path matchers reference one or more backend
services, where each backend service corresponds to a GKE
Service of type NodePort , as referenced in the Ingress . The backends for
each backend service are either instance groups or network endpoint groups
(NEGs). NEGs are created when you configure container-native load
balancing as
part of the configuration for your Ingress. For each backend service,
GKE creates a Google Cloud health check, based on the
readiness probe settings of the workload referenced by the corresponding
GKE Service .
If you are exposing an HTTP(S) service hosted on GKE, HTTP(S)
load balancing is the recommended method
for load balancing.
Note: The load balancers created by GKE are billed
according to the regular Cloud Load Balancing pricing . Note: To use Ingress, you must have the external Application Load Balancer add-on enabled.
GKE clusters have external Application Load Balancers enabled by default;
you must not disable it. Note: Google Kubernetes Engine relies on a health check mechanism to determine the
health status of the backend service. This mechanism cannot be used to
perform Blackbox monitoring. To perform Blackbox monitoring, create an
uptime check. For more information, see
(Optional) Monitoring the availability and latency of your service .
Objectives
Create a GKE cluster.
Deploy the sample web application to the cluster.
Expose the sample app to the internet behind an external Application Load Balancer.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
Take the following steps to enable the Kubernetes Engine API:
Visit the
Kubernetes Engine page in the Google Cloud console.
Create or select a project.
Wait for the API and related services to be enabled.
This can take several minutes.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Install the following command-line tools used in this tutorial:
gcloud is used to create and delete Kubernetes Engine clusters. gcloud
is included in the gcloud CLI .
kubectl is used to manage Kubernetes, the cluster orchestration system used by
Kubernetes Engine. You can install kubectl using gcloud :
gcloud components install kubectl
Clone the sample code from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/networking/load-balancing
Set defaults for the gcloud command-line tool
To save time typing your project ID
and Compute Engine zone options in the gcloud
command-line tool, you can set the defaults:
gcloud config set project project-id
gcloud config set compute/zone compute-zone
Create a GKE cluster
Create a GKE Autopilot cluster:
gcloud container clusters create-auto loadbalancedcluster
Deploying a web application
The following manifest describes a Deployment that runs the
sample web application container image on an HTTP server on port 8080:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : web
namespace : default
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
run : web
template :
metadata :
labels :
run : web
spec :
containers :
- image : us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0
imagePullPolicy : IfNotPresent
name : web
ports :
- containerPort : 8080
protocol : TCP
Apply the resource to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f web-deployment.yaml
Exposing your Deployment inside your cluster
The following manifest describes a Service that makes the
web deployment accessible within your container cluster:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
metadata :
name : web
namespace : default
spec :
ports :
- port : 8080
protocol : TCP
targetPort : 8080
selector :
run : web
type : NodePort
Apply the resource to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f web-service.yaml
When you create a Service of type NodePort with this
command, GKE makes your Service available on a randomly
selected high port number (e.g. 32640) on all the nodes in your cluster.
Verify that the Service is created and a node port is allocated:
kubectl get service web
Output:
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
web NodePort 10.35.245.219 <none> 8080:32640/TCP 5m
In the sample output, the node port for the web Service is 32640 .
Also, note that there is no external IP allocated for this Service. Since the
GKE nodes are not externally accessible by default, creating
this Service does not make your application accessible from the internet.
To make your HTTP(S) web server application publicly accessible, you must
create an Ingress resource.
Creating an Ingress resource
Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that encapsulates a collection of
rules and configuration for routing external HTTP(S) traffic to internal
services.
On GKE, Ingress is implemented using
Cloud Load Balancing . When you create an Ingress in your
cluster, GKE creates an HTTP(S) load balancer and
configures it to route traffic to your application.
The following manifest describes an Ingress resource that directs traffic to
your web Service:
apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1
kind : Ingress
metadata :
name : basic-ingress
spec :
defaultBackend :
service :
name : web
port :
number : 8080
Apply the resource to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f basic-ingress.yaml
After you deploy this manifest, Kubernetes creates an Ingress resource on your
cluster. The GKE Ingress controller creates and configures an
HTTP(S) Load Balancer according to the information in the Ingress,
routing all external HTTP traffic (on port 80) to the web NodePort Service you
exposed.
Note: To use Ingress, you must have the external Application Load Balancer add-on enabled.
GKE clusters have external Application Load Balancers enabled by default;
you must not disable it.
Visiting your application
Find out the external IP address of the load balancer serving your application
by running:
kubectl get ingress basic-ingress
Output:
NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE
basic-ingress * 203.0.113.12 80 2m
Note: It might take a few minutes for GKE to allocate an external
IP address and set up forwarding rules before the load balancer is ready to serve
your application. You might get errors such as HTTP 404 or HTTP 500 until the
load balancer configuration is propagated across the globe.
Open the external IP address of your application in a browser and see a
plain text HTTP response like the following:
Hello, world!
Version: 1.0.0
Hostname: web-6498765b79-fq5q5
You can visit Load Balancing on the Google Cloud console and inspect
the networking resources created by the GKE Ingress controller.
(Optional) Configuring a static IP address
When you expose a web server on a domain name, you need the external IP address
of an application to be a static IP that does not change.
By default, GKE allocates ephemeral external IP
addresses for HTTP applications exposed through an Ingress.
Ephemeral addresses are subject to change. If you are planning to run your
application for a long time, you must use a static external IP
address .
Note that after you configure a static IP for the Ingress resource, deleting the
Ingress does not delete the static IP address associated with it. Make sure to
clean up the static IP addresses you configured when you no longer plan to use
them again.
Warning: The following instructions create a static IP address and then
reference the IP address in an Ingress manifest. If you modify an existing
Ingress to use a static IP address instead of an ephemeral IP address,
GKE might change the IP address of the load balancer when
GKE re-creates the forwarding rule of the load balancer.
To configure a static IP address, complete the following steps:
Reserve a static external IP address named web-static-ip :
gcloud
gcloud compute addresses create web-static-ip --global
Config Connector
Note: This step requires
Config Connector . Follow the
installation instructions
to install Config Connector on your cluster.
apiVersion : compute.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : ComputeAddress
metadata :
name : web-static-ip
spec :
location : global
To deploy this manifest, download it to your machine as compute-address.yaml, and run:
kubectl apply -f compute-address.yaml
The basic-ingress-static.yaml manifest adds an annotation on Ingress to
use the static IP resource named web-static-ip :
apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1
kind : Ingress
metadata :
name : basic-ingress
annotations :
kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name : "web-static-ip"
spec :
defaultBackend :
service :
name : web
port :
number : 8080
View the manifest:
cat basic-ingress-static.yaml
Apply the resource to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f basic-ingress-static.yaml
Check the external IP address:
kubectl get ingress basic-ingress
Wait until the IP address of your application changes to use the reserved
IP address of the web-static-ip resource.
It might take a few minutes to update the existing Ingress resource,
re-configure the load balancer, and propagate the load balancing rules across the
globe. After this operation completes, GKE releases the
ephemeral IP address previously allocated to your application.
Note: Unused static external IP address are billed according to the regular IP
address billing .
(Optional) Serving multiple applications on a load balancer
You can run multiple services on a single load balancer and public IP by
configuring routing rules on the Ingress. By hosting multiple services on the
same Ingress, you can avoid creating additional load balancers (which are
billable resources) for every Service that you expose to the internet.
The following manifest describes a Deployment with version 2.0 of the same
web application:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : web2
namespace : default
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
run : web2
template :
metadata :
labels :
run : web2
spec :
containers :
- image : us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:2.0
imagePullPolicy : IfNotPresent
name : web2
ports :
- containerPort : 8080
protocol : TCP
Apply the resource to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f web-deployment-v2.yaml
The following manifest describes a Service that exposes web2 internally to
the cluster on a NodePort Service called web2 :
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
metadata :
name : web2
namespace : default
spec :
ports :
- port : 8080
protocol : TCP
targetPort : 8080
selector :
run : web2
type : NodePort
Apply the resource to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f web-service-v2.yaml
The following manifest describes an Ingress resource that:
routes the requests with path starting with /v2/ to the web2 Service
routes all other requests to the web Service
apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1
kind : Ingress
metadata :
name : fanout-ingress
spec :
rules :
- http :
paths :
- path : /*
pathType : ImplementationSpecific
backend :
service :
name : web
port :
number : 8080
- path : /v2/*
pathType : ImplementationSpecific
backend :
service :
name : web2
port :
number : 8080
Apply the resource to the cluster:
kubectl create -f fanout-ingress.yaml
After the Ingress is deployed, run kubectl get ingress fanout-ingress to find
out the public IP address of the cluster.
Note: It might take a few minutes for GKE to allocate an external IP
address and prepare the load balancer. You might get errors like
HTTP 404 and HTTP 500 until the load balancer is ready to serve the traffic.
Then visit the IP address to see that both applications are reachable on the
same load balancer:
Visit http://<IP_ADDRESS>/ and note that the response contains
Version: 1.0.0 (as the request is routed to the web Service)
Visit http://<IP_ADDRESS>/v2/ and note that the response contains
Version: 2.0.0 (as the request is routed to the web2 Service)
The only supported wildcard character for the path field of an Ingress
is the * character. The * character must follow a forward slash ( / ) and
must be the last character in the pattern. For example, /* , /foo/* , and
/foo/bar/* are valid patterns, but * , /foo/bar* , and /foo/*/bar are not.
A more specific pattern takes precedence over a less specific pattern. If you
have both /foo/* and /foo/bar/* , then /foo/bar/bat is taken to match
/foo/bar/* .
For more information about path limitations and pattern matching, see the
URL Maps documentation .
(Optional) Monitoring the availability and latency of your service
Google Cloud Uptime checks perform blackbox
monitoring of applications from the viewpoint of the user, determining latency
and availability from multiple external IPs to the IP address of the
load balancer. In comparison, Google Cloud health checks perform
an internal check against the Pod IPs, determining availability at the instance
level. The checks are complementary and provide a holistic picture of application
health.
You can create an uptime check by using the Google Cloud console, the
Cloud Monitoring API, or by using the Cloud Monitoring client libraries.
For information, see Managing uptime checks .
If you want to create an uptime check by using the Google Cloud console,
do the following:
Go to the Services & Ingress page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Services & Ingress
Click the name of the Service you want to create an uptime check for.
Click Create Uptime Check .
In the Create Uptime Check pane, enter a title for the uptime check
and then click Next to advance to the Target settings.
The Target fields of the uptime check are automatically filled
in using the information from the Service load balancer.
For complete documentation on all the fields in an uptime check, see
Creating an uptime check .
Click Next to advance to the Response Validation settings.
Click Next to advance to the Alert and Notification section.
To monitor an uptime check, you can create an alerting policy or view the
uptime check dashboard. An alerting policy can notify you by email or through
a different channel if your uptime check fails. For general information about
alerting policies, see Introduction to alerting .
Note: You can create an alerting policy for an uptime check as part of the
process of creating the uptime check. Creating an alerting policy is
optional, but it is recommended. For information on how to create
an alerting policy as an independent action, see
Alerting on uptime checks
Click Create .
Remarks
By default, Ingress performs a periodic health check by making a GET request
on the / path to determine the health of the application, and expects a HTTP
200 response. If you want to check a different path or to expect a different
response code, you can use a custom health check path .
Ingress supports more advanced use cases, such as:
Name-based virtual hosting: You can use Ingress to reuse the load balancer
for multiple domain names, subdomains, and to expose multiple Services on a
single IP address and load balancer. Check out the simple
fanout
and name-based virtual
hosting
examples to learn how to configure Ingress for these tasks.
HTTPS termination : You can configure the
Ingress
to terminate the HTTPS traffic using the Cloud Load Balancer.
Note: Always modify the properties of the Load Balancer using the Ingress object.
Making changes directly on the load balancing resources might get lost or
overridden by the GKE Ingress controller.
When an Ingress is deleted, the GKE Ingress controller cleans up the associated
resources (except reserved static IP addresses) automatically.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete any manually created forwarding rules and target proxies that reference the Ingress:
Note: This step is needed only if the load balancer associated with the
Ingress is updated manually using the Kubernetes Engine API or the
Google Cloud console.
A dangling target proxy that is referencing a GKE Ingress controller managed
URL map will cause the deletion of the Ingress to fail in GKE
versions 1.15.4-gke.22+. Inspect the Ingress resource to find an event with
an error message similar to the following:
Error during GC: error running load balancer garbage collection routine: googleapi: Error 400: The url_map resource 'projects/ project-id /global/urlMaps/k8s2-um-tlw9rhgp-default-my-ingress-9ifnni82' is already being used by 'projects/ project-id /global/targetHttpsProxies/k8s2-um-tlw9rhgp-default-my82-target-proxy', resourceInUseByAnotherResource
In the preceding error message, k8s2-um-tlw9rhgp-default-my82-target-proxy
is a manually created target https proxy that is still referencing the
URL map k8s2-um-tlw9rhgp-default-my-ingress-9ifnni82 which was created
and managed by an Ingress controller.
These manually created frontend resources (both forwarding rule and
target proxy) must be deleted before proceeding with the deletion of
the Ingress.
Delete the Ingress: This step deallocates the ephemeral external IP
address and the load balancing resources associated with your application:
kubectl delete ingress basic-ingress
If you followed the optional step to create an Ingress to route
requests by path, then delete the Ingress:
kubectl delete ingress fanout-ingress
Delete the static IP address: Complete this step only if you followed the
optional step to create a static IP address.
If you followed "Option 1" to convert an existing ephemeral IP address
to static IP, then visit the Google Cloud console to delete
the static IP address.
If you followed "Option 2" to create a new static IP address, then run the
following command to delete the static IP address:
gcloud compute addresses delete web-static-ip --global
Delete the cluster: This step deletes the compute nodes of
your container cluster and other resources such as the Deployments in the
cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete loadbalancedcluster
