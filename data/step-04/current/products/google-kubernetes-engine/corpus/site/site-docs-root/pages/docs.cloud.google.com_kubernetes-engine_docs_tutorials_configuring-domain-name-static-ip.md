Standard
This tutorial demonstrates how to use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to expose your
web application to the internet on a static external IP address
and configure a domain name to point to your application.
This tutorial assumes you own a registered domain name, such as example.com .
Note: This tutorial uses the built-in GKE Ingress Controller
and does not apply to the NGINX Ingress Controller .
Objectives
This tutorial demonstrates the following steps:
Reserve a static external IP address for your application
Configure either Service or
Ingress resources to use the
static IP address
Update DNS records of your domain name to point to your application
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
Take the following steps to enable the Kubernetes Engine API:
Visit the
Kubernetes Engine page in the Google Cloud console.
Create or select a project.
Wait for the API and related services to be enabled.
This can take several minutes.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Install the following command-line tools used in this tutorial:
gcloud is used to create and delete Kubernetes Engine clusters. gcloud
is included in the gcloud CLI .
kubectl is used to manage Kubernetes, the cluster orchestration system used by
Kubernetes Engine. You can install kubectl using gcloud :
gcloud components install kubectl
Clone the sample code from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/quickstarts/hello-app/manifests
Set defaults for the gcloud command-line tool
To save time typing your project ID
and Compute Engine zone options in the gcloud
command-line tool, you can set the defaults:
gcloud config set project project-id
gcloud config set compute/zone compute-zone
Create a cluster
Create a cluster:
gcloud container clusters create-auto domain-test
Deploy your web application
The following manifest describes a Deployment that runs a sample web
application container image:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : helloweb
labels :
app : hello
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
app : hello
tier : web
template :
metadata :
labels :
app : hello
tier : web
spec :
containers :
- name : hello-app
image : us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0
ports :
- containerPort : 8080
resources :
requests :
cpu : 200m
Create the Deployment:
kubectl apply -f helloweb-deployment.yaml
Expose your application
You can expose your application on GKE using either of the
following methods:
Use a Service , which creates an
external passthrough Network Load Balancer
that works with regional IP addresses.
Use an Ingress , which creates an
Application Load Balancer
and supports global IP addresses.
To learn more about the advantages and disadvantages of each method,
see
Setting up an external Application Load Balancer with Ingress .
Use a Service
To ensure that your application has a static external IP address, you must
reserve a static IP address .
Note: Static IP addresses have no cost when they are used by a load
balancer. If you reserve a static IP address and don't use it, you are
charged per unused IP address pricing .
If you choose to expose your application using a
Service ,
you must create a regional IP address. Global IP addresses only work with
Ingress resource type, as explained in the next section.
To use a Service, create a static IP address named helloweb-ip in the
region us-central1 :
gcloud
gcloud compute addresses create helloweb-ip --region us-central1
Find the static IP address that you created:
gcloud compute addresses describe helloweb-ip --region us-central1
The output is similar to the following:
...
address: 203.0.113.32
...
Config Connector
Note: This step requires
Config Connector . Follow the
installation instructions
to install Config Connector on your cluster.
apiVersion : compute.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : ComputeAddress
metadata :
name : helloweb-ip
spec :
location : us-central1
Save the manifest as compute-address-regional.yaml .
Apply the manifest to your cluster:
kubectl apply -f compute-address-regional.yaml
Find the static IP address that you created:
kubectl get computeaddress helloweb-ip -o jsonpath = '{.spec.address}'
The following manifest describes a
Service of type LoadBalancer, which
creates an external passthrough Network Load Balancer to expose Pods with an external IP address.
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
metadata :
name : helloweb
labels :
app : hello
annotations :
networking.gke.io/load-balancer-ip-addresses : "helloweb-ip"
spec :
selector :
app : hello
tier : web
ports :
- port : 80
targetPort : 8080
type : LoadBalancer
Create the Service:
kubectl apply -f helloweb-service-static-ip.yaml
View the reserved IP address associated with the load balancer:
kubectl get service
The output is similar to the following:
NAME CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
helloweb 10.31.254.176 203.0.113.32 80:30690/TCP 54s
Note: Provisioning and configuring the load balancer might take a few minutes.
Use an Ingress
If you choose to expose your application using an
Ingress ,
you must
reserve a global static IP address .
Use the annotation kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name to specify a global IP address.
To expose your application to clients and services in a region, use a regional static internal IP address while deploying an internal ingress resource for GKE along with the
required annotations .
To learn how to use Ingress to expose your applications to the
internet, see
Setting up an external Application Load Balancer with Ingress .
Note: Static IP addresses have no cost when they are used by a load
balancer. If you reserve a static IP address and don't use it, you are
charged per
unused IP address pricing .
To create a global static IP address named helloweb-ip :
gcloud
gcloud compute addresses create helloweb-ip --global
Find the static IP address that you created:
gcloud compute addresses describe helloweb-ip --global
The output is similar to the following:
...
address: 203.0.113.32
...
Config Connector
Note: This step requires
Config Connector . Follow the
installation instructions
to install Config Connector on your cluster.
apiVersion : compute.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind : ComputeAddress
metadata :
name : helloweb-ip
spec :
location : global
Save the manifest as compute-address-global.yaml .
Apply the manifest to your cluster:
kubectl apply -f compute-address-global.yaml
The following manifest describes an Ingress that exposes a web application on
a static IP with two resources:
A Service with type:NodePort
An Ingress configured with the service name and static IP annotation
apiVersion : networking.k8s.io/v1
kind : Ingress
metadata :
name : helloweb
annotations :
kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name : helloweb-ip
labels :
app : hello
spec :
defaultBackend :
service :
name : helloweb-backend
port :
number : 8080
---
apiVersion : v1
kind : Service
metadata :
name : helloweb-backend
labels :
app : hello
spec :
type : NodePort
selector :
app : hello
tier : web
ports :
- port : 8080
targetPort : 8080
The kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name annotation specifies the name
of the global IP address resource to be associated with the
load balancer.
Apply the manifest to your cluster:
kubectl apply -f helloweb-ingress-static-ip.yaml
View the IP address associated with the load balancer:
kubectl get ingress
The output is similar to the following
NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE
helloweb * 203.0.113.32 80 4m
Note: Provisioning and configuring the load balancer might take a few
minutes.
View your reserved static IP address
To verify that the load balancer is configured correctly, you can either use a
web browser to visit the IP address or use curl :
curl http://203.0.113.32/
The output is similar to the following:
Hello, world!
Hostname: helloweb-3766687455-8lvqv
Note: You might get HTTP 404 and HTTP 500 errors for a few minutes if you used an Ingress to configure a load balancer. It takes time for configuration
changes to propagate to regions across the globe.
Configure your domain name records
To have browsers querying your domain name, such as example.com , or subdomain
name, such as blog.example.com , point to the static IP address you reserved,
you must update the DNS (Domain Name Server) records of your domain name.
You must create an A (Address) type DNS record for your domain or subdomain
name and have its value configured with the reserved IP address
DNS records of your domain are managed by your name server. Your name server might
be the "registrar" where you registered your domain, a DNS service
such as Cloud DNS , or another third-party
provider.
If your nameserver is Cloud DNS: Follow Cloud DNS Quickstart
guide to configure DNS A record for your
domain name with the reserved IP address of your application.
If your nameserver is another provider: Refer to your DNS
providers documentation on setting DNS A records to configure your domain name. If
you choose to use Cloud DNS instead, refer to
Migrating to Cloud DNS .
Visit your domain name
To verify that your domain name's DNS A records resolve to the IP address you
reserved, visit your domain name.
Note: It can take a few hours for DNS records to propagate. This time might depend
on your name servers, local internet service provider (ISP), and many other
factors.
To make a DNS query for your domain name's A record, run the host
command:
host example.com
The output is similar to the following:
example.com has address 203.0.113.32
You can now point your web browser to your domain name and visit your
website.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the Service and Ingress:
kubectl delete ingress,service -l app = hello
Release the reserved static IP. After the load balancer is deleted, the
unused but reserved IP address is billed per unused IP address pricing.
If you used a Service:
gcloud compute addresses delete helloweb-ip --region us-central1
If you used an Ingress:
gcloud compute addresses delete helloweb-ip --global
Delete the sample application:
kubectl delete -f helloweb-deployment.yaml
Delete the cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete domain-test
