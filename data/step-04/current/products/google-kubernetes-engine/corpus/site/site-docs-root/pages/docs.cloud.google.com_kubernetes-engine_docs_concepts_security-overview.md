Autopilot
Standard
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides many ways to help secure your workloads .
Protecting workloads in GKE involves many layers of the stack, including
the contents of your container image, the container runtime, the cluster network,
and access to the cluster API server.
It's best to take a layered approach to protecting your clusters and workloads. You can
apply the principle of least privilege
to the level of access provided to your users and your application. In each layer, your organization might need to make different tradeoffs
to allow the right level of flexibility and security to securely deploy and
maintain your workloads. For example, some security settings
might be too constraining for certain types of applications or use cases to function without
significant refactoring.
This document provides an overview of each layer of your infrastructure, and
shows how you can configure its security features to best suit your needs.
This document is for
Security specialists who define, govern and implement policies and procedures
to protect an organization's data from unauthorized access. To learn more about
common roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Note: GKE Autopilot clusters implement many security
configurations for you. For details, refer to
Autopilot security capabilities .
Authentication and authorization
Kubernetes supports two types of authentication :
User accounts are accounts that are known to Kubernetes, but are not
managed by Kubernetes - for example, you cannot create or delete them using
kubectl .
Service accounts are accounts that are created and managed by Kubernetes,
but can only be used by Kubernetes-created entities,
such as pods .
In a GKE cluster ,
Kubernetes user accounts are managed by Google Cloud, and may be
one of the following two types:
Google Account
Google Cloud service account
Once authenticated, you need to authorize these identities to create,
read, update or delete Kubernetes resources.
Despite the similar names, Kubernetes service accounts and Google Cloud service accounts
are different entities. Kubernetes service accounts are part of the cluster in
which they are defined and are typically used within that cluster. By contrast,
Google Cloud service accounts are part of a Google Cloud project, and can easily be granted
permissions both within clusters and to Google Cloud project clusters themselves,
as well as to any Google Cloud resource using
Identity and Access Management (IAM) .
This makes Google Cloud service accounts more powerful than Kubernetes service accounts;
in order to follow the security principle of least privilege, you should
consider using Google Cloud service accounts only when their capabilities are required.
To configure more granular access to Kubernetes resources at the cluster level
or within Kubernetes namespaces, you use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) .
RBAC allows you to create detailed policies that define which
operations and resources you allow users and service accounts to access. With RBAC,
you can control access for Google Accounts, Google Cloud service accounts, and Kubernetes
service accounts. To further simplify and streamline your authentication and
authorization strategy for GKE, you should ensure that the
legacy Attribute Based Access Control
is disabled so that Kubernetes RBAC and IAM are the sources of truth.
For more information:
Read the
GKE RBAC documentation .
Learn about supported authentication methods when connecting to the Kubernetes
API server in Authenticating to the Kubernetes API server .
Control plane security
In GKE, the
Kubernetes control plane components
are managed and maintained by Google. The control plane components host the
software that runs the Kubernetes control plane, including the API server,
scheduler, controller manager, and the etcd API. If the cluster runs etcd
database instances on the control plane VMs, these instances are also managed
and maintained by Google.
You can access the control plane using a DNS-based endpoint (recommended),
IP-based endpoints, or both. If you use IP-based endpoints, you can protect the
Kubernetes API server by using authorized networks and not enabling
the external endpoint of the control plane. This lets you assign an internal IP
address to the control plane and disable access on the external IP address. If
you use a DNS-based endpoint, you can use IAM and
VPC Service Controls to secure your
control plane access with both identity and network-aware policies.
You can handle cluster authentication in Google Kubernetes Engine by using
IAM as the identity provider. For information on authentication,
see Authenticating to the Kubernetes API server .
Another way to help secure your control plane is to make sure that you are
doing credential rotation
on a regular basis. When credential rotation is initiated, the SSL certificates
and cluster certificate authority are rotated. This process is automated by
GKE and also helps ensure that your control plane IP address
rotates.
For more information:
Read more about control plane security .
Read the
Role-Based Access Control documentation .
Follow the
Credential Rotation guide .
Node security
GKE deploys your workloads on Compute Engine instances running in your Google Cloud project.
These instances are attached to your GKE cluster as nodes .
The following sections show you how to leverage the node-level security features available to you in Google Cloud.
Container-Optimized OS
By default, GKE nodes
use Google's Container-Optimized OS
as the operating system on which to run Kubernetes and its components.
Container-Optimized OS implements several advanced features
for enhancing the security of GKE clusters, including:
Locked-down firewall
Read-only filesystem where possible
Limited user accounts and disabled root login
GKE Autopilot nodes always use Container-Optimized OS as the operating system.
Warning: Loading kernel modules that aren't shipped with Container-Optimized OS is
unsupported. Doing so can lead to security vulnerabilities and reliability
issues.
Node upgrades
A best practice is to patch your OS on a regular basis. From time to time,
security issues in the container runtime, Kubernetes itself, or the node
operating system might require you to upgrade your nodes more urgently. When you
upgrade your node, the node's software is upgraded to their latest versions.
GKE clusters support
automatic upgrades . In
Autopilot clusters, automatic upgrades are always enabled. You can
also
manually upgrade
the nodes in a Standard cluster.
Protect nodes from untrusted workloads
For clusters that run unknown or untrusted workloads, a good practice is to
protect the operating system on the node from the untrusted workload running in
a Pod.
For example,
multi-tenant clusters
such as software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers often execute unknown code
submitted by their users. Security research is another application where
workloads may need stronger isolation than nodes provide by default.
You can enable
GKE Sandbox
on your cluster to isolate untrusted workloads in sandboxes on the node.
GKE Sandbox is built using gVisor , an open source
project.
Secure instance metadata
GKE uses
instance metadata from the
underlying Compute Engine instances to provide nodes with credentials and
configurations that are used to bootstrap nodes and to connect to the control
plane. This metadata contains sensitive information that Pods on the node don't
need access to, such as the node's service account key.
You can lock down sensitive instance metadata paths by using
Workload Identity Federation for GKE .
Workload Identity Federation for GKE enables the
GKE metadata server
in your cluster, which filters requests to sensitive fields such as kube-env .
Workload Identity Federation for GKE is always enabled in Autopilot clusters. In
Standard clusters, Pods have access to instance metadata unless you
manually enable Workload Identity Federation for GKE.
Network security
Most workloads running in GKE need to communicate with other
services that could be running either inside or outside of the cluster. You can
use several different methods to control what traffic is allowed to flow through
your clusters and their Pods.
Limit Pod-to-Pod communication
By default, all Pods in a cluster can be reached over the network via their Pod
IP address. Similarly, by default, egress traffic allows outbound connections to
any address accessible in the VPC into which the cluster was deployed.
Cluster administrators and users can lock down the ingress and egress
connections created to and from the Pods in a namespace by using
network policies .
By default, when there are no network policies defined, all ingress and egress
traffic is allowed to flow into and out of all Pods. Network policies allow you
to use tags to define the traffic flowing through your Pods.
Once a network policy is applied in a namespace, all traffic is dropped to and from Pods that
don't match the configured labels. As part of your creation of clusters and/or
namespaces, you can apply
the default deny traffic to both ingress and egress
of every Pod to ensure that all new workloads added to the cluster must
explicitly authorize the traffic they require.
For more information:
Read more about
network policies
Follow the
network policy tutorial
Read more about
default policies
Filter load balanced traffic
To load balance your Kubernetes Pods with a
network load balancer ,
you need to create a Service of type LoadBalancer that matches your Pod's
labels. With the Service created, you will have an external-facing IP that maps
to ports on your Kubernetes Pods. Filtering authorized traffic is achieved at
the node level by
kube-proxy , which
filters based on IP address.
To configure this filtering, you can use the
loadBalancerSourceRanges configuration of the Service object. With this
configuration parameter, you can provide a list of CIDR ranges that you would
like to allow for access to the Service. If you do not configure
loadBalancerSourceRanges , all addresses are allowed to access the Service via
its external IP.
For cases in which external access to the Service is not required, consider using an
internal load balancer .
The internal load balancer also respects the loadBalancerSourceRanges when it
is necessary to filter out traffic from inside of the VPC.
For more information, follow the internal load balancing tutorial .
Filter traffic outside of the cluster
To control the flow of network traffic between external entities and your
cluster, use Cloud Next Generation Firewall . You can
use firewall configurations to, for example, block outgoing traffic from your
Pods to unapproved destinations.
Firewall configurations aren't enough to control which registries the container
images in your cluster come from. To limit container image pulls to a set of
approved registries, see
Block container images from unapproved registries .
Secure your workloads
Kubernetes allows users to quickly provision, scale, and update container-based
workloads. This section describes tactics that administrators and users can
employ to limit the effect a running container can have on other containers in
the same cluster, the nodes where containers can run, and the Google Cloud
services enabled in users' projects.
Limit privileges for containerized Pod processees
Limiting the privileges of containerized processes is important for the overall
security of your cluster. GKE Autopilot clusters
always restrict specific privileges, as described in
Autopilot security capabilities .
GKE also allows you to set security-related
options via the
Security Context
on both Pods and containers. These settings allow you to change security
settings of your processes like:
User and group to run as
Available Linux capabilities
Ability to escalate privileges
To enforce these restrictions at the cluster level rather than at the Pod or
container levels, use the
PodSecurityAdmission controller .
Cluster administrators can use PodSecurityAdmission to ensure that all Pods in
a cluster or namespace adhere to a pre-defined policy in the
Pod Security Standards .
You can also set custom Pod security policies at the cluster level by using
Gatekeeper .
Note: You can't use these policies to override the built-in security
configurations in GKE Autopilot.
The GKE node operating systems, both Container-Optimized OS
and Ubuntu, apply the default Docker AppArmor security policies
to all containers started by Kubernetes. You can view the profile's template on
GitHub .
Among other things, the profile denies the following abilities to
containers:
Write files directly in /proc/
Write to files that are not in a process ID directory ( /proc/<number> )
Write to files in /proc/sys other than /proc/sys/kernel/shm*
Mount filesystems
Note: SELinux is not
supported on GKE. Use AppArmor instead. Note: The default Docker AppArmor profile is applied by the container runtime at
the node level, which means the profile is applied even if
container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/container-name
annotations are missing from a Pod. As a result, security scanners that only
examine Kubernetes API resources might falsely identify Pods without this
annotation as missing an AppArmor profile, even though the AppArmor profile is
applied at the node level.
For more information:
Read the
Pod Security Context documentation .
Learn more about existing protections in the
Container-Optimized OS AppArmor documentation .
Give Pods access to Google Cloud resources
Your containers and Pods might need access to other resources in
Google Cloud. There are three ways to do this.
Workload Identity Federation for GKE (recommended)
The most secure way to authorize Pods to access Google Cloud resources
is with
Workload Identity Federation for GKE .
Workload Identity Federation for GKE allows a Kubernetes service account to run as an
IAM service account.
Pods that run as the Kubernetes service account have the permissions of the IAM service account.
Workload Identity Federation for GKE can be used with
GKE Sandbox .
Node service account
In Standard clusters, your Pods can also authenticate to
Google Cloud using the credentials of the
service account used by the node's
Compute Engine virtual machine (VM).
Caution: Any Pod running in the cluster can use the node's service account
credentials from the VM metadata. If you use this method, create and
configure a custom service account that has the
minimum IAM roles
that are required by the Pods running in the cluster.
This approach is not compatible with
GKE Sandbox
because GKE Sandbox blocks access to the Compute Engine metadata server.
Service account JSON key (not recommended)
Caution:
Service account keys are a security risk if not managed correctly. You should
choose a more secure alternative to service account keys
whenever possible. If you must authenticate with a service account key, you are responsible for the
security of the private key and for other operations described by
Best practices for managing service account keys .
If you are prevented from creating a service account key, service account key creation might
be disabled for your organization. For more information, see
Managing secure-by-default organization resources .
If you acquired the service account key from an external source, you must validate it before use.
For more information, see
Security requirements for externally sourced credentials .
You can grant credentials for Google Cloud resources to
applications by using the
service account key . This
approach is strongly discouraged because of the difficulty of securely managing
account keys.
If you choose this method, use custom IAM service accounts for
each application
so that applications have the minimal necessary permissions. Grant each service
account the minimum IAM roles that are needed for its
paired application to operate successfully. Keeping the service accounts
application-specific makes it easier to revoke access in the case of a
compromise without affecting other applications. After you have assigned your
service account the correct IAM roles, you can create a JSON
service account key, and then mount the key into your Pod using a Kubernetes
Secret .
Use Binary Authorization
Binary Authorization is a service on
Google Cloud that provides software supply-chain security for applications
that run in the cloud. Binary Authorization works with images that you deploy
to GKE from Artifact Registry or another container image
registry.
With Binary Authorization enforcement, you can ensure that internal
processes that safeguard the quality and integrity of your software have
successfully completed before an application is deployed to your production
environment. For instructions about creating a cluster with
Binary Authorization enabled, visit Creating a cluster
in the Binary Authorization documentation .
With Binary Authorization continuous validation (CV) ,
you can ensure that container images associated with Pods are regularly
monitored to ensure that they conform to your evolving internal processes.
Audit logging
Audit logging provides a way for administrators to retain, query, process, and
alert on events that occur in your GKE environments.
Administrators can use the logged information to do forensic analysis, real-time
alerting, or for cataloging how a fleet of GKE clusters are being
used and by whom.
By default, GKE logs Admin Activity logs. You can optionally also
log Data Access events, depending on the types of operations you are interested
in inspecting.
For more information:
Follow the
GKE audit logging tutorial .
Read more about Cloud Audit Logs .
Built-in security measures
GKE enforces specific restrictions on what you can do to system
objects in your clusters. When you perform an operation like creating or
patching a workload, an admission webhook
named warden-validating validates your request against a set of restricted
operations and decides whether to allow the request.
Admission errors that are caused by this policy are similar to the following:
GKE Warden rejected the request because it violates one or more constraints.
Autopilot cluster security measures
Autopilot clusters apply multiple security settings based on our
expertise and industry best practices. For details, see
Security measures in Autopilot .
Standard cluster security measures
Standard clusters are more permissive by default than Autopilot
clusters. GKE Standard clusters have the following
security settings:
You can't update the ServiceAccount used by GKE-managed system
workloads, such as workloads in the kube-system namespace.
You can't bind the cluster-admin default ClusterRole to the system:anonymous ,
system:unauthenticated , or system:authenticated groups.
You can manually
enable specific Autopilot security policies in your Standard cluster .
