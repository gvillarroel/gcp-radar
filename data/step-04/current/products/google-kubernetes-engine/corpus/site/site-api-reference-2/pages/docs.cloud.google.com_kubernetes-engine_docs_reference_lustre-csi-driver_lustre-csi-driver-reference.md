Managed Lustre CSI driver reference
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The following manifests describe supported CSI driver fields in the Storage
Class and Persistent Volume resources.
Storage Class
The following manifest includes all of the supported fields in the Storage
Class.
apiVersion : storage.k8s.io/v1
kind : StorageClass
metadata :
name : lustre-csi-example-storage-class
provisioner : lustre.csi.storage.gke.io
parameters :
network : VPC_NETWORK # optional
filesystem : LUSTRE_FILESYSTEM_NAME # optional
labels : KEY_1=VALUE_1,KEY_2=VALUE_2,...,KEY_N=VALUE_N # optional
description : DESCRIPTION # optional
perUnitStorageThroughput : 125 | 250 | 500 | 1000 # required
volumeBindingMode : WaitForFirstConsumer | Immediate # default is Immediate
allowedTopologies :
- matchLabelExpressions :
- key : topology.gke.io/zone
values :
- ZONE_1
- ZONE_2
mountOptions :
- LUSTRE_MOUNT_OPTIONS
Replace the following values:
network : optional. The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network in which to create the Managed Lustre instance.
If this property is not specified, the default network is used.
To create a Managed Lustre instance in a shared
VPC network, the full name of the
network must be provided. For example, projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ VPC_NETWORK_NAME .
filesystem : specifies the fsname for
the Managed Lustre instance. This parameter is used for dynamic provisioning .
The fsname must be an alphanumeric string
of up to eight characters, beginning with an alphabetic character. If you don't
provide a value, the CSI driver generates an fsname with the format
"lfs NNNNN " (for example, "lfs97603" ).
Note: If you plan to mount multiple Managed Lustre instances
on the same node, you'll need a separate StorageClass for each
instance. Each of these StorageClasses must specify a unique fsname value
to avoid conflicts when mounting on the same node.
labels : optional.
Managed Lustre supports labels per instance, as a map of key-value
pairs. The Managed Lustre CSI driver lets you attach user-provided labels to the
instance.
description : optional. A description of the instance. Must be
2,048 characters or fewer.
perUnitStorageThroughput : specifies the per-unit storage throughput
(MB/s/TiB) for the instance. Supported values are 125 , 250 , 500 , and 1000 . The default
is 1000 .
allowTopologies : optional. Managed Lustre instances are zonal
resources. If this property is not specified, the Managed Lustre
instance is created in the same zone as the CSI controller Driver Pod, and the
volume binding mode defaults to Immediate .
If WaitForFirstConsumer is specified, the topology is set to where the Pod
is scheduled. However, this setting can cause Pods to be blocked while they wait for a
volume to be provisioned.
The Managed Lustre CSI driver supports the topology feature to ensure that persistent volumes and Pods are placed
in the allowed topologies, based on the topology provided in the StorageClass.
mountOptions : optional. Specifies mount.lustre mount options. Managed Lustre volumes
inherit these mount options from the StorageClass in the pv.spec.mountOptions field.
Persistent Volume
The following manifest includes all of the supported fields in the Persistent
Volume.
apiVersion : v1
kind : PersistentVolume
metadata :
name : preprov-pv
annotations :
pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by : lustre.csi.storage.gke.io
spec :
mountOptions :
- LUSTRE_MOUNT_OPTIONS
...
storageClassName : ""
capacity :
storage : CAPACITY
accessModes :
- ReadWriteMany
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy : Retain
volumeMode : Filesystem
csi :
driver : lustre.csi.storage.gke.io
volumeHandle : EXISTING_LUSTRE_INSTANCE_NAME
volumeAttributes :
ip : EXISTING_LUSTRE_IP_ADDRESS
filesystem : EXISTING_LUSTRE_FSNAME
Replace the following values:
capacity.storage : the capacity of the Managed Lustre instance.
Refer to Performance tiers
for the supported minimum and maximum instance capacities.
mountOptions : Specifies mount.lustre mount options. This value is inherited from the mountOptions field in the StorageClass.
csi.volumeHandle : an exclusive identifier for a Managed Lustre
instance. Must use the following
format: PROJECT_ID / LOCATION / INSTANCE_NAME .
csi.volumeAttributes.ip : the IP address of the Managed Lustre
instance, used for mounting.
csi.volumeAttributes.filesystem : the file system name of the
Managed Lustre instance, which is an eight-character identifier.
