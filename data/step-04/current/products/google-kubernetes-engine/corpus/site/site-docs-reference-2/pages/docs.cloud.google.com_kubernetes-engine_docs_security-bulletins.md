Security bulletins
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
All security bulletins for the following products are described in this page:
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on VMware
GKE on AWS
GKE on Azure
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on bare metal
Vulnerabilities are often kept secret under embargo until affected parties have
had a chance to address them. In these cases, the product's release notes will
refer to "security updates" until the embargo has been lifted. At that point the
notes will be updated to reflect the vulnerability the patch addressed.
Note: If you run multi-tenant workloads on GKE or GDC (VMware),
pay particular attention to these bulletins. These vulnerabilities are
more likely to impact multi-tenant workloads. For a technical description of
security boundaries in GKE or GDC (VMware) and how these impact workloads,
see
Isolation at different layers of the Kubernetes stack .
When GKE issues a security bulletin that directly correlates to
your cluster configuration or version, we might send you a SecurityBulletinEvent
cluster notification that provides information about the vulnerability and actions
that you can take, if applicable. For information about setting up cluster
notifications, refer to Cluster notifications .
GKE platforms don't use components such as ingress-nginx and
the CRI-O container runtime, and are unaffected by any vulnerabilities in those
components. If you install components from other sources, refer to the security
updates and patching advice of those components at the source. For example,
starting in March 2026,
Ingress NGINX is retired .
If you use Ingress NGINX, you should migrate to an alternative system as soon
as possible.
For more information on how Google manages security vulnerabilities and patches
for GKE, see Security patching .

Description
Severity
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been identified in the OpenSSL library. The most significant finding is CVE-2025-15467, a critical vulnerability that might allow for remote code execution (RCE) or denial of service (DoS) attacks via network-based vectors.
GKE control plane and infrastructure is not vulnerable. GKE core infrastructure, including the Kubernetes API Server and Kubelet, remains unaffected. These services use BoringCrypto (a security-hardened module derived from BoringSSL ), which does not contain the vulnerable code found in the standard OpenSSL distribution.
GKE Nodes: The OpenSSL library included in the GKE Node OS images (Container-Optimized OS and Ubuntu) contains the vulnerable code. While the control plane is secure, software running within your nodes or administrative tools on the host OS might be at risk.

GDC (bare metal)
Description
Severity
Several security issues have been discovered in OpenSSL. The most critical is CVE-2025-15467, which could be used to execute a denial of service or remote code execution attack over the internet.
GDC software for bare metal is not vulnerable to this threat. GDC software for bare metal uses BoringCrypto for network facing services such as the Kubernetes apiserver and Kubelet, and BoringCrypto is not affected by this vulnerability. BoringCrypto is extracted from BoringSSL , a fork of OpenSSL focused on security hardening and performance.
GDC software for bare metal does not provide a node OS. Customers are responsible for installing and maintaining a supported Linux distribution on physical hardware before installing the GKE software.
What should I do?
Update your Linux OS image to one that includes the latest Open SSL distribution.

GKE
Description
Severity
A security issue was discovered where attackers might be able to bypass
workload isolation
restrictions on GKE clusters. Only clusters relying on node isolation to separate workloads
inside a cluster are affected. Note that node isolation should
never be used as a primary security boundary.
To exploit this vulnerability, attackers must first gain access to the kubelet node client
credentials. Access to these credentials typically requires root permissions on the host and
access to the host filesystem. For most systems, this means you need both an application
vulnerability to gain access to the workload and a container breakout vulnerability to gain
access to the host. Attackers with access to such credentials could do the following:
Attackers could re-register the node with the same
name, but with different values for certain fields in the Node object.
Specifically, an attacker could set .spec.providerID to point to a different
instance in the cluster, causing the GKE control plane to delete the referenced
Compute Engine instance.
Attackers could also change .spec.taints to affect workload scheduling.
When implementing node isolation as a security control, you must use labels and label
selectors with the node-restriction.kubernetes.io/ prefix to prevent
compromised nodes from manipulating scheduling behavior.
What should I do?
Implement the following changes to address this issue:
Upgrade your GKE cluster and optionally implement validating admission policy
Address the provider ID issue by upgrading your GKE clusters to a patched version. The
following versions of GKE or later have been updated to address the providerID issue:
1.33.1-gke.1386000
1.32.4-gke.1533000
1.31.9-gke.1119000
1.30.12-gke.1208000
Optionally, if you cannot upgrade, implement the following validating admission policy on your cluster to mitigate the providerID issue:
apiVersion : admissionregistration . k8s . io / v1
kind : ValidatingAdmissionPolicy
metadata :
name : validate - node - providerid
spec :
failurePolicy : Fail
matchConstraints :
resourceRules :
- apiGroups : [ "" ]
apiVersions : [ "v1" ]
operations : [ "CREATE", "UPDATE" ]
resources : [ "nodes" ]
matchConditions :
- name : "has-providerid"
expression : "has(object.spec.providerID)"
validations :
- expression : "object.spec.providerID == '' || object.spec.providerID.endsWith('/' + object.metadata.name)"
message : "node.spec.providerID must match the node name"
---
apiVersion : admissionregistration . k8s . io / v1
kind : ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding
metadata :
name : validate - node - providerid - binding
spec :
policyName : validate - node - providerid
validationActions : [ Deny ]
Use node restricted labels when isolating workloads to specific
nodes as a security control
If you are using labels for node isolation, as described in
Kubernetes documentation ,
use node restricted labels (for example, labels of the form node-restriction.kubernetes.io/example-constraint )
in node affinity and node selector terms used for workload isolation.
Kubelet node credentials are prevented from applying such labels by the
NodeRestriction
admission controller. The NodeRestriction admission controller is built into Kubernetes
and enabled on all GKE clusters.
GKE restricts the scope of node credentials on newly created nodes for new clusters
As an additional hardening measure, new clusters starting from GKE version
1.33.1-gke.1386000 restrict the scope of node credentials on newly created nodes. Node
credentials are bound to the Compute Engine instance originally provisioned for the Node. After the
instance is deleted, attackers are prevented from using such compromised credentials to
register the Node, with attacker controlled taints or providerID values.
You can create a new cluster with version 1.33.1-gke.1386000 or later for newly-created
nodes to have this additional hardening.

Reference: CVE-2025-1974
GKE
Description
Severity
Several security issues have been discovered in the NGINX Ingress Controller,
ingress-nginx , an open source software component that runs inside Kubernetes
clusters to help manage network traffic coming into the cluster. The most critical is
CVE-2025-1974. For the full details and a complete list, see the
Kubernetes CVE feed .
These issues affect ingress-nginx . If you do not have ingress-nginx
installed on your cluster, you are not affected.
GKE clusters do not use ingress-nginx , and are
not impacted by these security issues unless you have installed ingress-nginx on your
cluster. If you have installed ingress-nginx on your GKE
cluster, you may be vulnerable to these security issues.
Using CVE-2025-1974, an unauthenticated attacker with access to the Pod network can
achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx
controller. This can lead to disclosure of Secrets that are accessible to the controller.
When using the default configuration of ingress-nginx , the controller can
access all Secrets in the entire cluster.
What should I do?
Check if your GKE clusters are using ingress-nginx by using one of
the following commands:
Check an individual cluster:
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector app.kubernetes.io/name = ingress-nginx
Check multiple clusters at once using a
Cloud Asset Inventory resource search query :
gcloud asset search-all-resources \
--scope = 'organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID ' \
--asset-types = 'k8s.io/Pod' \
--query = 'labels."app.kubernetes.io/name"="ingress-nginx"'
Replace ORGANIZATION_ID with your organization resource
ID. For details, see Getting your organization resource ID .
Upgrade ingress-nginx to a patched version. For details, see
the official Kubernetes CVE feed .
Read about customizing network isolation in GKE .
To reduce risks from untrusted networks, consider using
private nodes
and ensuring that you have restrictive firewall configurations
in place.

Published: 2025-01-23
Reference: N/A
GKE
Description
Severity
A security issue was discovered in the Google Secret Manager Provider for Secret Store CSI Driver . To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to do the following:
Create Pods on nodes where the CSI driver is running.
Create Secrets in the same namespaces as those Pods.
Mount Secrets Store CSI volumes on the Pod with the nodePublishSecretRef option set.
Provide a malicious Application Default Credential configuration in the Secret.
Reference the Secret in the nodePublishSecretRef option on the volume mount.
By following these steps, an attacker could trick the CSI driver into leaking the Kubernetes service account token of the CSI driver to a URL controlled by the attacker.
The Secret Manager Provider can be used in two ways with a GKE cluster. The Secret Manager add-on for GKE is a managed feature available on GKE clusters. Alternatively, as a GKE user you can install the open source Google Secret Manager Provider for Secret Store CSI Driver on your GKE cluster. In both cases, the provider allows a Kubernetes Pod to access secrets stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager as files mounted to the Pod as a volume.
The fixes for both the managed GKE Secret Manager add-on and open source Secret Manager Provider disable the use of nodePublishSecretRef to avoid this issue. This was determined not to impact any existing usage of the GKE Secret Manager add-on. A very small number of GKE clusters using the open source Secret Manager Provider with nodePublishSecretRef might see an impact. The open source patch makes it possible to re-enable the nodePublishSecretRef feature via the ALLOW_NODE_PUBLISH_SECRET environment variable, if necessary.
What should I do?
Do either of following depending on how your GKE cluster uses the Secret Manager Provider:
Managed GKE Secret Manager add-on
If you're using the managed GKE add-on , upgrade your GKE cluster to a patched version. The following versions of GKE are updated with code to fix this vulnerability. Upgrade your node pools to the following versions or later:
1.27.16-gke.2051000
1.28.15-gke.1362000
1.29.11-gke.1012000
1.30.6-gke.1596000
1.31.1-gke.1846000
To receive the fix as quickly as possible, we recommend manually upgrading your cluster and Standard node pools to a patched GKE version. GKE release channels allow you to patch before the new version becomes an auto-upgrade target on your selected release channel.
Open source Secret Manager Provider
If you're using the open source Secret Manager provider , upgrade to 1.7.0. If you use the Helm Chart , the latest version already refers to 1.7.0. If you base your installation directly on the deploy/provider-gcp-plugin.yaml file, note that the image has also been updated in that file.

Severity
2025-01-23 Update: Updated the Affected resources section.
2025-01-08 Update: The actual start date and time of the issue was 2024-12-04 at 22:47 UTC.
A security issue was introduced on 2024-12-08 at 13:44 UTC and resolved on 2025-01-04 at 04:00 UTC. This security issue impacted resources in VPCs with GKE Multi-Cluster Gateway (MCG) configured. MCG is an optional feature that is used by a small subset of GKE customers. We are individually notifying customers who had the feature enabled during that time period.
Multi-Cluster Gateway (MCG) is a GKE feature that allows customers to load balance traffic across multiple clusters. To perform that function, MCG needs to make changes to the project-level Google Cloud firewall. An error inside MCG resulted in the creation of an ingress firewall rule that allowed TCP traffic to all IPs (0.0.0.0/0) and ports inside the VPC. Steps have been taken to prevent errors of this type in the future.
As the firewall is a VPC-level allow list, the following types of resources might have been network reachable during the time period:
Customer applications running on GKE worker nodes accessible through public IPs.
Customer applications running on Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs) with public IPs.
Any other Google Cloud resources in the same VPC as the cluster with public IPs and listening ports.
GKE worker nodes, Compute Engine VMs, and other resources that were only using private IPs might have been more broadly accessible within their VPC, but they would not have been accessible to the Internet. Applications protected by the following mechanisms would've reduced or eliminated their exposure:
Equal or higher priority DENY firewall rules (MCG sets firewall rules priority to 1000 by default)
Service mesh using identity-based authorization
Application-level authorization
Affected resources
2025-01-23 Update: GKE fleets (or hubs) using MCG in shared VPC service projects are not affected by the issue as firewall rules are not managed from shared VPC service projects.
Resources residing in VPCs with GKE MCG configured and listening on public IPs were affected. The resources affected include, but are not limited to, applications running on GKE worker nodes.
What should I do?
The issue has been resolved across all impacted VPCs by fixing the incorrect firewall configuration. The rules created in error have been automatically modified with the appropriate source ranges (130.211.0.0/22, 35.191.0.0/16) to allow the ingress traffic coming from Google Cloud health check infrastructure, and, optionally, your proxy-only subnet ranges for Internal Gateways. To know more about the firewall rules automatically created by MCG in your project(s), see GKE Gateway firewall rules.
You can, optionally, confirm resolution by checking the managed firewall rules on VPCs using GKE MCG. Confirm a source range is set on managed firewall rules that use the prefix gkemcg1-l7- . Inspect these rules and confirm a source range is set.
To list the MCG managed firewall rules in your current environment, run the following command:
gcloud compute firewall-rules list --format = "json" --filter = "name:gkemcg1-l7-*" | jq -r '.[] | "\(.name): \(.sourceRanges // "No source range")"' | awk -F: '{if ($2 ~ /No source range|^\s*$/) print "Rule "$1" has an EMPTY or MISSING source range."; else print "Rule "$1" has source range(s): "$2;}'
To search logs for updates to MCG managed firewall configurations, use the Logs Explorer with the below query:
protoPayload.serviceName="compute.googleapis.com"
resource.type="gce_firewall_rule"
protoPayload.resourceName=~"projects/[^/]+/global/firewalls/gkemcg1-"
-operation.last="true"
To list the MCG managed firewall rules across your organization, run the following command to query Cloud Asset Inventory:
gcloud asset search-all-resources
--scope = 'organizations/ '
--asset-types = 'compute.googleapis.com/Firewall'
--query 'name: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/*/*/firewalls/gkemcg*'
The following additional controls provide defense in depth against untrusted networks and can be considered to strengthen security posture:
Use private GKE nodes to ensure your nodes only get private IPs.
Use explicit DENY firewall policies where possible.
Use hierarchical firewall policy to override VPC level firewall configurations.
Use Cloud Service Mesh to provide authentication and authorization.
Use in-application authentication and authorization.
Use Organization Policy Service to block firewall rules that allow all traffic. To do so, create a constraint for denying all traffic firewall rules , and apply it with a policy.
We recommend reviewing configurations and logs to identify any applications or services that might have been exposed during the previously mentioned time period that should not have been exposed. You can use the following tools to check inbound traffic to your resources running in Google Cloud:
VPC Flow Logs for visibility into network throughput and performance
Cloud Logging to search and analyze logging data and events from Google Cloud services and applications configured to send logs
Firewall Rules Logging to audit, verify, and analyze the effects of your firewall rules
Security Command Center for visibility into security findings indicating suspicious network activity

Severity
2024-07-03 Update: An expedited rollout is in progress and is
expected to make new patch versions available across all zones by
July 3, 2024 at 5 PM US and Canadian Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7). To
get a notification as soon as a patch is available for your specific cluster, use
cluster notifications .
2024-07-02 Update: This vulnerability affects both Autopilot mode
and Standard mode clusters. Each section that follows will tell you the modes to
which that section applies.
A remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2024-6387 ,
was recently discovered in OpenSSH. The vulnerability exploits a race condition that
could be used to obtain access to a remote shell, enabling attackers to gain root access
to GKE nodes. At the time of publication, exploitation is believed to be
difficult and take several hours per machine being attacked. We are not aware of any
exploitation attempts.
All supported versions of Container Optimized OS and Ubuntu images on GKE
run versions of OpenSSH that are vulnerable to this issue.
GKE clusters with public node IP addresses and SSH exposed to the Internet
should be treated with the highest priority for mitigation.
The GKE control plane is not vulnerable to this issue.
What should I do?
2024-07-03 Update: Patch versions for GKE
An expedited rollout is in progress and is expected to make new patch versions
available across all zones by July 3, 2024 at 5 PM US and Canadian Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7).
Clusters and nodes with autoupgrade enabled will begin upgrading as the week progresses,
but due to the severity of the vulnerability we recommend upgrading manually as follows to
get patches as fast as possible.
For both Autopilot and Standard clusters,
upgrade your control plane
to a patched version. Additionally, for Standard mode clusters,
upgrade your node pools
to a patched version. Autopilot clusters will begin upgrading your nodes to match
the control plane version
as soon as possible .
Patched GKE versions are available for every supported version to minimize
the changes necessary to apply the patch. The version number of each new version is an
increment on the final digit in the version number of a corresponding existing version.
For example, if you are on 1.27.14-gke.1100000, you will upgrade to 1.27.14-gke.1100002 to
get the fix with the smallest possible change. The following patched GKE
versions are available:
1.26.15-gke.1090004
1.26.15-gke.1191001
1.26.15-gke.1300001

To check whether a patch is available in your cluster zone or region, run the following
command:
gcloud container get-server-config --location= LOCATION
Replace LOCATION with your zone or region.
2024-07-02 Update: Both Autopilot mode and Standard mode
clusters should be upgraded as soon as possible after patch versions are available.
A patched GKE version that includes an updated OpenSSH will be made
available as soon as possible. This bulletin will be updated when patches are available.
To receive a Pub/Sub notification when a patch is available for your channel,
enable cluster notifications .
We recommend working through the following steps to check your cluster's exposure, and
applying the mitigations described, as necessary.
Determine whether your nodes have public IP addresses
2024-07-02 Update: This section applies to both Autopilot and
Standard clusters.
If a cluster is created with enable-private-nodes ,
nodes will be private, which mitigates the vulnerability by removing exposure to the
Internet. Run the following command to determine if your cluster has private nodes enabled:
gcloud container clusters describe $CLUSTER_NAME \
--format="value(privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateNodes)"
If the return value is True, all nodes are private nodes for this cluster and the
vulnerability is mitigated. If the value is empty or false, continue on to apply one of
the mitigations in the following sections.
To find all clusters originally created with public nodes, use this Cloud Asset Inventory query
in the project or organization:
SELECT
resource.data.name AS cluster_name,
resource.parent AS project_name,
resource.data.privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateNodes
FROM
`container_googleapis_com_Cluster`
WHERE
resource.data.privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateNodes is null OR
resource.data.privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateNodes = false
Disallow SSH to the cluster nodes
2024-07-02 Update: This section applies to both Autopilot and
Standard clusters.
The default network is pre-populated with a default-allow-ssh firewall rule
to allow SSH access from the public Internet. To remove this access, you can:
Optionally create rules
to allow any SSH access you need from trusted networks to GKE nodes
or other Compute Engine VMs in the project.
Disable the default firewall rule with the following command:
gcloud compute firewall-rules update default-allow-ssh --disabled --project=$PROJECT
If you have created any other firewall rules that may allow SSH through TCP on port 22,
disable them, or limit the source IPs to trusted networks.
Verify that you can no longer SSH to the cluster nodes
from the Internet. This firewall configuration mitigates the vulnerability.
Convert public node pools to private
2024-07-02 Update: For Autopilot clusters originally created as
public clusters, you can place your workloads on private nodes
by using nodeSelectors .
However, Autopilot nodes that run system workloads on clusters that were originally
created as public clusters will still be public nodes and should be
protected by using the firewall changes described in the preceding section.
To best protect clusters originally created with public nodes, we recommend first
disallowing SSH through the firewall as already described. If you are not able to disallow
SSH through the firewall rules, you can convert public node pools on GKE
Standard clusters to private by following this guidance to isolate node pools .
Change SSHD configuration
2024-07-02 Update: This section only applies to Standard
clusters. Autopilot workloads aren't allowed to modify node configuration.
If none of these mitigations can be applied, we have also published a daemonset
that sets SSHD LoginGraceTime to zero, and restarts the SSH daemon. This
daemonset can be applied to the cluster to mitigate the attack. Note that this configuration
may increase the risk of denial of service attacks and may cause issues with legitimate
SSH access. This daemonset should be removed after a patch has been applied.

mitigations as necessary.
Disallow SSH to the cluster nodes
You can change your infrastructure network setup to disallow SSH connectivity from
untrusted sources, such as the public Internet.
Change sshd configuration
If you can't apply the preceding mitigation, we have
published a DaemonSet
that sets the sshd LoginGraceTime to zero and restarts the SSH daemon. This
DaemonSet can be applied to the cluster to mitigate the attack. Note that this
configuration might increase the risk of denial of service attacks and might cause issues
with legitimate SSH access. Remove this DaemonSet after a patch has been applied.
Note: Patch versions for GDC software for VMware
are in progress. We'll update this bulletin with that information when it's available.

Description
Severity
2024-07-11 Update: The following versions of GKE on AWS
have been updated with code to fix this vulnerability:
1.27.14-gke.1200
1.28.10-gke.1300
1.29.5-gke.1100
Upgrade your GKE on AWS control plane and node pools to one of these
patched versions or later. For instructions, see
Upgrade your AWS cluster version
and
Update a node pool .
2024-07-02 Update: All supported versions of Ubuntu images on
GKE on AWS run versions of OpenSSH that are vulnerable to this issue.
GKE on AWS clusters with public node IP addresses and SSH exposed to the
Internet should be treated with the highest priority for mitigation.
A remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2024-6387 ,
was recently discovered in OpenSSH. The vulnerability exploits a race condition that
could be used to obtain access to a remote shell, enabling attackers to gain root access
to GKE nodes. At the time of publication, exploitation is believed to be
difficult and take several hours per machine being attacked. We are not aware of any
exploitation attempts.
What should I do?
2024-07-02 Update: A patched GKE on AWS version that
includes an updated OpenSSH will be made available as soon as possible. This bulletin
will be updated when patches are available. We recommend that you work through the
following steps to check your cluster's exposure, and apply the described mitigations as
necessary.
Determine whether your nodes have public IP addresses
GKE on AWS doesn't provision any machine with either public IP addresses
or with firewall rules that allow traffic to port 22 by default. However, depending on
your subnet configuration ,
machines can automatically get a public IP address during provisioning.
To check whether nodes are provisioned with public IP addresses,
look at the configuration of the subnet
that's associated with your AWS node pool resource.
Disallow SSH to the cluster nodes
Even though GKE on AWS doesn't allow traffic on port 22 on any node by
default, customers can attach additional security groups to node pools, enabling inbound
SSH traffic.
We recommend that you
remove or scope down
corresponding rules from the provided security groups.
Convert public node pools to private
To best protect clusters with public nodes, we recommend first disallowing SSH through
your security group, as described in the previous section. If you can't disallow SSH
through the security group rules, you can convert public node pools to private by
disabling the option to automatically assign public IPs to machines within a subnet
and reprovisioning the node pool.
Note: Patch versions for GKE on AWS are in progress. We'll update this bulletin with that information when it's available.

Updated: 2024-07-11
Description
Severity
2024-07-11 Update: The following versions of GKE on Azure
have been updated with code to fix this vulnerability:
1.27.14-gke.1200
1.28.10-gke.1300
1.29.5-gke.1100
Upgrade your GKE on Azure control plane and node pools to one of these
patched versions or later. For instructions, see
Upgrade your Azure cluster version
and
Update a node pool .
2024-07-02 Update: All supported versions of Ubuntu images on
GKE on Azure run versions of OpenSSH that are vulnerable to this issue.
GKE on Azure clusters with public node IP addresses and SSH exposed to the
Internet should be treated with the highest priority for mitigation.
A remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2024-6387 ,
was recently discovered in OpenSSH. The vulnerability exploits a race condition that
could be used to obtain access to a remote shell, enabling attackers to gain root access
to GKE nodes. At the time of publication, exploitation is believed to be
difficult and take several hours per machine being attacked. We are not aware of any
exploitation attempts.
What should I do?
2024-07-02 Update: A patched GKE on Azure version that
includes an updated OpenSSH will be made available as soon as possible. This bulletin
will be updated when patches are available. We recommend that you work through the
following steps to check your cluster's exposure, and apply the described mitigations as
necessary.
Determine whether your nodes have public IP addresses
GKE on Azure doesn't provision any machine with either
public IP addresses
or with firewall rules that allow traffic to port 22 by default. To review your
Azure configuration to check whether there are any public IP addresses configured on
your GKE on Azure cluster, run the following command:
az network public-ip list -g CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -o tsv
Disallow SSH to the cluster nodes
Even though GKE on Azure doesn't allow traffic on port 22 on any node by
default, customers can update NetworkSecurityGroup rules to node pools, enabling inbound
SSH traffic from the public internet.
We strongly recommend that you review the Network Security Groups (NSGs) associated with
your Kubernetes clusters. If an NSG rule exists that allows unrestricted inbound traffic
on port 22 (SSH), do one of the following:
Remove the rule entirely : If SSH access to the cluster nodes isn't
required from the internet, remove the rule to eliminate potential attack vectors.
Scope down the rule : Restrict inbound access on port 22 to only the
specific IP addresses or ranges that require it. This minimizes the exposed surface for
potential attacks.
Convert public node pools to private
To best protect clusters with public nodes, we recommend first disallowing SSH through
your security group, as described in the previous section. If you can't disallow SSH
through the security group rules, you can convert public node pools to private by
removing the public IP addresses associated with the VMs.
To remove a public IP address from a VM and replace it with a private IP address
configuration, see
Dissociate a public IP address from a an Azure VM .
Impact: Any existing connections using the public IP address will be
disrupted. Ensure that you have alternative access methods in place, like a VPN or
Azure Bastion.
Note: Patch versions for GKE on Azure are in progress. We'll update this bulletin with that information when it's available.

GDC (bare metal)
Updated: 2024-07-02
Description
Severity
2024-07-02 Update: The original version of this bulletin for
GDC software for bare metal incorrectly stated that patch versions were in progress.
GDC software for bare metal is not directly affected because it doesn't manage the
operating system SSH daemon or configuration. Patch versions are therefore the
responsibility of the operating system provider, as described in the
What should I do? section.
A remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2024-6387 ,
was recently discovered in OpenSSH. The vulnerability exploits a race condition that
could be used to obtain access to a remote shell, enabling attackers to gain root access
to GKE nodes. At the time of publication, exploitation is believed to be
difficult and take several hours per machine being attacked. We are not aware of any
exploitation attempts.
What should I do?
2024-07-02 Update: Contact your OS provider to obtain a patch for the
operating systems in use with GDC software for bare metal.
Until you've applied the OS vendor patch, ensure that public reachable machines don't
allow SSH connections from the internet. If that isn't possible, an alternative is to
set the LoginGraceTime to zero and restart the sshd server:
grep "^LoginGraceTime" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
LoginGraceTime 0
Note that this configuration change might increase the risk of denial of service attacks
and may cause issues with legitimate SSH access.
Original 2024-07-01 text (see the preceding 2024-07-02 update for a correction):
Note: Patch versions for GDC software for bare metal
are in progress. We'll update this bulletin with that information when it's available.

Description
Severity
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability (CVE-2023-45288) was recently discovered in multiple implementations of the HTTP/2 protocol, including the golang HTTP server used by Kubernetes. The vulnerability could lead to a DoS of the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) control plane. GKE clusters with authorized networks configured are protected by limiting network access, but all other clusters are affected.
GKE Autopilot and Standard clusters are affected.
Note: This bulletin is only for CVE-2023-45288 as it applies to the Kubernetes API server running on the GKE control plane. Other components that use the Go net/http2 package and that might also be vulnerable to CVE-2023-45288 are at a lower risk as they are not publicly exposed. Golang updates for components on GKE nodes are available on a regular update schedule.
What should I do?

Description
Severity
CVE-2023-5528 allows an attacker to create pods and persistent volumes on Windows nodes
in a way that enables admin privilege escalation on those nodes.
GKE Standard clusters running
Windows Server
nodes and using an in-tree storage plugin might be affected.
GKE Autopilot clusters and GKE node pools using
GKE Sandbox are not
affected because they do not support Windows Server nodes.
What should I do?
Determine if you have Windows Server nodes in use on your clusters:
kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/os=windows
Check audit logs for evidence of exploitation. Kubernetes audit logs can be audited to
determine if this vulnerability is being exploited. Persistent Volume create events with
local path fields containing special characters are a strong indication of exploitation.
Update your GKE cluster and node pools to a patched version. The
following versions of GKE have been updated to fix this vulnerability.

runc is a low-level tool for spawning and running Linux containers used in
Kubernetes Pods. In runc versions prior to the patches released in this
security bulletin, several file descriptors were inadvertently leaked into the
runc init process that runs within a container. runc also did
not verify that a container's final working directory was inside the container's mount
namespace. A malicious container image or a user with permission to run arbitrary Pods
could use a combination of the leaked file descriptors and lack of working directory
validation to gain access to a node's host mount namespace and access the entire host
filesystem and overwrite arbitrary binaries on the node.

2024-01-26 Update: Clarified the number of affected clusters and the actions that
we took to help mitigate the impact.
GKE
Updated: 2024-01-26
Description
Severity
2024-01-26 Update : Security research that found a small number of
GKE clusters with a customer-created misconfiguration involving
the system:authenticated group has now been published. The researcher's blog
post refers to 1,300 clusters with some misconfigured bindings, and 108 with high
privileges. We have worked closely with impacted customers to notify them and assist with
removing their misconfigured bindings.
We have identified several clusters where users have granted Kubernetes
privileges to the system:authenticated group, which includes all
users with a Google account. These types of bindings are not
recommended , as they violate the principle of least privilege and grant
access to very large groups of users. See guidance under 'What should I do' for
instructions on how to find these types of bindings.
Recently, a security researcher reported findings of clusters with RBAC
misconfigurations through our vulnerability reporting program.
Google's approach to authentication is to make authenticating to Google Cloud and
GKE as simple and secure as possible without adding complex configuration steps.
Authentication just tells us who the user is; Authorization is
where access is determined. So the system:authenticated group in
GKE that contains all users authenticated through Google's identity provider is
working as intended and functions in the same way as the IAM
allAuthenticatedUsers identifier .
With this in mind we've taken several steps to reduce the risk of users
making authorization errors with the Kubernetes built-in users and
groups, including system:anonymous ,
system:authenticated , and system:unauthenticated . All
of these users/groups represent a risk to the cluster if granted permissions. We
discussed some of the attacker activity targeting RBAC misconfigurations and
available defenses at
Kubecon in November 2023 .
To protect users from accidental authorization errors with these system
users/groups, we have:
By
default blocked new bindings of the highly privileged ClusterRole
cluster-admin to User system:anonymous , Group
system:authenticated , or Group system:unauthenticated
in GKE version 1.28.
Built detection rules into Event
Threat Detection (GKE_CONTROL_PLANE_CREATE_SENSITIVE_BINDING) as part of
Security Command Center.
Built configurable prevention rules into Policy Controller with K8sRestrictRoleBindings .
Sent email notifications to all GKE users with bindings to these
users/groups asking them to review their configuration.
Built network authorization features and made
recommendations to restrict network access to clusters as a first layer of
defense.
Raised awareness about this issue through
a talk at Kubecon in November 2023 .
Clusters that apply authorized
networks restrictions have a first layer of defense: they cannot be attacked
directly from the Internet. But we still recommend removing these bindings for
defense in depth and to guard against errors in network controls.
Note there are a number of cases where bindings to Kubernetes system users
or groups are used intentionally: e.g. for kubeadm
bootstrapping , the Rancher
dashboard and Bitnami
sealed secrets . We have confirmed with those software vendors that those
bindings are working as intended.
We are investigating ways we can further protect against user RBAC
misconfiguration with these system users/groups through prevention and
detection.
What should I do?
To prevent any new bindings of cluster-admin to User
system:anonymous , Group system:authenticated , or Group
system:unauthenticated users can upgrade to GKE v1.28 or
later ( release
notes ), where creation of those bindings are blocked.
Existing bindings should be reviewed following
this guidance .

GKE
Description
Severity
An attacker who has compromised the Fluent Bit logging container could combine that
access with high privileges required by Cloud Service Mesh (on clusters that have
enabled it) to escalate privileges in the cluster. The issues with Fluent Bit and
Cloud Service Mesh have been mitigated and fixes are now available. These vulnerabilities
are not exploitable on their own in GKE and require an initial compromise.
We are not aware of any instances of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
These issues were reported through our
Vulnerability Reward Program .
What should I do?
The following versions of GKE have been updated with code to fix
these vulnerabilities in Fluent Bit and for users of managed Cloud Service Mesh. For
security purposes, even if you have node auto-upgrade enabled, we recommend that
you
manually upgrade
your cluster and node pools to one of the following GKE versions or
later:
1.25.16-gke.1020000
1.26.10-gke.1235000
1.27.7-gke.1293000
1.28.4-gke.1083000
A recent feature of
release channels
allows you to apply a patch without having to unsubscribe from a channel. This lets
you secure your nodes until the new version becomes the default for your specific
release channel
If your cluster uses in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh, you must
manually upgrade to one of
the following versions
( release notes ):
1.17.8-asm.8
1.18.6-asm.2
1.19.5-asm.4
What vulnerabilities are being addressed by this patch?
The vulnerabilities addressed by this bulletin require an attacker to compromise the
Fluent Bit logging container. We are not aware of any existing vulnerabilities in
Fluent Bit that would lead to this prerequisite condition for privilege escalation.
We have patched these vulnerabilities as hardening measures to prevent a potential
full attack chain in the future
GKE uses Fluent Bit to process logs for workloads running on clusters.
Fluent Bit on GKE was also configured to collect logs for
Cloud Run workloads. The volume mount configured to collect those logs gave
Fluent Bit access to Kubernetes service account tokens for other Pods running on the
node. The researcher used this access to discover a highly privileged service account
token for clusters that have Cloud Service Mesh enabled.
Cloud Service Mesh required high privileges to make necessary modifications to a
cluster's configuration including the ability to create and delete Pods. The
researcher used Cloud Service Mesh's privileged Kubernetes service account token to
escalate their initial compromised privileges by creating a new pod with
cluster-admin privileges
We have removed Fluent Bit's access to the service account tokens and have
redesigned the functionality of Cloud Service Mesh to remove excess privileges.

GKE
Updated: 2023-11-09
Description
Severity
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability was recently discovered in multiple implementations of the HTTP/2 protocol (CVE-2023-44487), including the golang HTTP server used by Kubernetes. The vulnerability could lead to a DoS of the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) control plane. GKE clusters with authorized networks configured are protected by limiting network access, but all other clusters are affected.
What should I do?
2023-11-09 Update: We have released new versions of
GKE that include the Go and Kubernetes security patches, which you
can update your clusters to now. In the coming weeks we will release additional
changes to the GKE control plane to further mitigate this issue.
The following GKE versions have been updated with patches for
CVE-2023-44487 and CVE-2023-39325:
1.24.17-gke.2155000
1.25.14-gke.1474000
1.26.10-gke.1024000
1.27.7-gke.1038000
1.28.3-gke.1090000
We recommend that you apply the following mitigation as soon as possible and upgrade to the latest patched version when available.
Golang patches will be released on October 10. Once available, we will build and qualify a new Kubernetes API server with those patches and make a GKE patched release. Once the GKE release is available, we will update this bulletin with guidance on which version to upgrade your control plane, and also make the patches visible within GKE GKE security posture when available for your cluster. To receive a Pub/Sub notification when a patch is available for your channel, enable cluster notifications .
A recent feature of release channels allows you to apply a patch without having to unsubscribe from a channel. This lets you secure your nodes until the new version becomes the default for your release specific channel.
Mitigate by configuring authorized networks for control plane access:
You can add authorized networks for existing clusters. To learn more see, authorized network for existing clusters .
In addition to the authorized networks you add, there are preset IP addresses that can access the GKE control plane. To learn more about these addresses, see Access to control plane endpoints . The following items summarize the cluster isolation:
Private clusters with --master-authorized-networks and PSC-based clusters with --master-authorized-networks and --no-enable-google-cloud configured are the most isolated.
Legacy public clusters with --master-authorized-networks and PSC-based clusters with --master-authorized-networks and --enable-google-cloud (default) configured are additionally accessible by the following:
Public IP addresses of all Compute Engine VMs in Google Cloud
Google Cloud platform IP addresses

GKE on Bare Metal
Description
Severity
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability was recently discovered in multiple implementations of the HTTP/2 protocol (CVE-2023-44487), including the golang HTTP server used by Kubernetes. The vulnerability could lead to a DoS of the Kubernetes control plane. Anthos on Bare Metal creates Kubernetes clusters that are not directly accessible to the Internet by default and are protected from this vulnerability.
What should I do?
If you have configured your Anthos on Bare Metal Kubernetes clusters to have direct access to the Internet or other untrusted networks, we recommend working with your firewall administrator to block or limit that access. To learn more, see the GKE on Bare Metal security overview .
We recommend that you upgrade to the latest patch version, when available, as soon as possible.

GKE
Description
Severity
Three vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-3676, CVE-2023-3955, CVE-2023-3893) have been discovered in Kubernetes where a user that can create Pods on Windows nodes may be able to escalate to admin privileges on those nodes. These vulnerabilities affect the Windows versions of Kubelet and the Kubernetes CSI proxy.
GKE clusters are only affected if they include Windows nodes.
What should I do?
The following versions of GKE have been updated with code to fix this
vulnerability. For security purposes, even if you have node auto-upgrade enabled, we
recommend that you
manually upgrade your
cluster and node pools to one of the following GKE versions:
1.24.17-gke.200
1.25.13-gke.200
1.26.8-gke.200
1.27.5-gke.200
1.28.1-gke.200
The GKE control plane will be updated the week of 2023-09-04 to update the
csi-proxy to version 1.1.3. If you update your nodes prior to the control plane update,
you will need to update your nodes again after the update to take advantage of the new
proxy. You can update the nodes again, even without changing the node version, by running
the gcloud container clusters upgrade command and passing the
--cluster-version flag with the same GKE version that the node
pool is already running. You must use the gcloud CLI for this workaround.
Note that this will cause an update regardless of
maintenance windows .
A recent feature of
release channels
allows you to apply a patch without having to unsubscribe from a channel. This lets you
secure your nodes until the new version becomes the default for your specific
release channel.
What vulnerabilities are addressed by this patch?
With CVE-2023-3676, a malicious actor could craft a Pod spec with host path strings that
contain PowerShell commands. Kubelet lacks input sanitization and passes this crafted
path string to the command executor as an argument where it would execute parts of the
string as separate commands. These commands would run with the same administrative
privileges as Kubelet has.
With CVE-2023-3955, Kubelet grants users who can create Pods the ability to execute code
at the same permission level as the Kubelet agent, privileged permissions.
With CVE-2023-3893, a similar lack of input sanitation lets a user who can create Pods on
Windows nodes running kubernetes-csi-proxy to escalate to admin privileges on those nodes.
Kubernetes audit logs can be used to detect if this vulnerability is being exploited. Pod
create events with embedded PowerShell commands are a strong indication of exploitation.
ConfigMaps and Secrets that contain embedded PowerShell commands and are mounted into
Pods are also a strong indication of exploitation.

Updated: 2023-08-11
Description
Severity
Two new security issues were discovered in Kubernetes where users may be able to launch containers that bypass policy restrictions when using ephemeral containers and either ImagePolicyWebhook (CVE-2023-2727) or the ServiceAccount admission plugin (CVE-2023-2728)
Anthos on AWS does not use ImagePolicyWebhook and is not affected by CVE-2023-2727.
All versions of Anthos on AWS are potentially vulnerable to CVE-2023-2728.
What should I do?
2023-08-11 Update: The following version of GKE on AWS has been updated with code to fix this vulnerability. Upgrade your nodes to the following GKE on AWS version:
1.15.2
Note: Patched versions of Anthos on AWS will be released soon. This security bulletin will be updated when new Anthos on VMware versions are available.
What vulnerabilities are being addressed?
With CVE-2023-2727, users may be able to launch containers using images that are restricted by ImagePolicyWebhook when using ephemeral containers. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ImagePolicyWebhook admission plugin is used together with ephemeral containers. This CVE can also be mitigated by using validation webhooks, such as Gatekeeper and Kyverno, to enforce the same restrictions.
In CVE-2023-2728, users may be able to launch containers that bypass the mountable secrets policy enforced by the ServiceAccount admission plugin when using ephemeral containers. The policy ensures that Pods running with a service account may only reference secrets specified in the service account's secrets field. Clusters are impacted by this vulnerability if:
The ServiceAccount admission plugin is used.
The kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets annotation is used by a service account. This annotation is not added by default.
Pods are using ephemeral containers.

Severity
A new vulnerability (CVE-2022-2327) has been discovered in the
Linux kernel that can lead to local privilege escalation. This
vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to achieve a full container
breakout to root on the node.
Technical details
2023-12-21 Update : The original bulletin stated Autopilot
clusters are impacted, but this was incorrect. GKE Autopilot
clusters in the default configuration are not impacted, but might be vulnerable if you
explicitly set the seccomp Unconfined profile or
allow CAP_NET_ADMIN .
GKE clusters, including Autopilot clusters, with Container-Optimized OS (COS) using Linux
Kernel version 5.10 are affected. GKE clusters using Ubuntu images
or using GKE
Sandbox are unaffected.
What should I do?
Upgrade your GKE clusters to a version that includes the fix.
The Linux node images for COS have been updated along with GKE
versions using those COS versions.
For security purposes,
even if you have the node autoupgrade enabled, we recommend that
you manually
upgrade your node pools to one of the following GKE
versions:
COS versions
1.22.12-gke.300
1.23.8-gke.1900
1.24.2-gke.1900

A security vulnerability, CVE-2022-23648, has been discovered in containerd's handling of path traversal in the OCI image volume specification. Containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation with a specially-crafted image configuration could gain full read access to arbitrary files and directories on the host.
This vulnerability may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy). This vulnerability affects all GKE node operating systems (Container-Optimized OS and Ubuntu) which use containerd by default. All GKE, Autopilot, and GKE Sandbox nodes are affected.
What should I do?
The versions of Linux node images for the following versions of GKE have been updated with code to fix this vulnerability. For security purposes, even if you have node-autoupgrade enabled, we recommend that you manually upgrade your nodes to one of the following GKE versions:
1.19.16-gke.9400
1.20.15-gke.3600
1.21.10-gke.1500
1.22.7-gke.1500
1.23.4-gke.1500

despite this issue.
There is a misconfiguration with Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), also known as Hyper-threading, on GKE Sandbox images. The misconfiguration leaves nodes potentially exposed to
side channel attacks such as Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS)
(for more context, see GKE Sandbox documentation ).
We do not recommend using the following affected versions:

1.22.6-gke.300
1.23.2-gke.300
1.23.3-gke.600
If you manually enabled SMT for a node pool , then this issue does not affect your sandboxed nodes.
What should I do?
Upgrade your nodes to one of the following versions:
1.22.6-gke.1500 and later
1.23.3-gke.1100 and later
What vulnerability is addressed by this patch?

GKE
Description
Severity
Update 2022-03-15: Added hardening guides for GKE on AWS and GKE on Azure. Added a section on persistence using webhooks.
Some unexpected paths to access the node VM on GKE Autopilot clusters could have been used to escalate privileges in the cluster. These issues have been fixed and no further action is required . The fixes address issues reported through our Vulnerability Reward Program .
GKE Standard and GKE clusters users can optionally apply a similar hardening policy as described below.
Technical details
Note: The security boundary for GKE nodes is the single-tenant virtual machine, and as such the ability to access the node VM from pods is not considered a security boundary for Autopilot . Nodes are not shared between clusters or customers. Any actor taking advantage of these issues must first be granted access to the cluster itself with at least permissions to schedule pods.
Host access using third party policy exemptions
In order to allow Google Cloud to offer full management of nodes, and a Pod-level SLA, GKE Autopilot restricts some highly privileged Kubernetes primitives to limit workloads from having low-level access to the node VM. To set this in context: GKE Standard presents full access to the underlying compute, Autopilot presents limited access, and Cloud Run presents no access.
Autopilot relaxes some of those restrictions for a predefined list of third party tools to allow customers to run those tools on Autopilot without modification. Using privileges to create pods with host path mounts, the researcher was able to run a privileged container in a pod that looked like one of these allowlisted third party tools to gain access to the host.
The ability to schedule pods in this way is expected on GKE Standard, but not on GKE Autopilot, as it bypassed the host-access restrictions used to enable the SLA described previously.
This issue was fixed by tightening the third party allow-listing pod specification.
Privilege escalation from root-on-node
In addition to the host access, the stackdriver-metadata-agent-cluster-level and the metrics-server pods were identified as highly privileged. After gaining root-level access to the node, these services could be used to gain further control over the cluster.
We have deprecated and removed the stackdriver-metadata-agent for both GKE Standard and Autopilot. This component is still in use on GKE on VMware and Google Distributed Cloud Virtual for Bare Metal.
As a system hardening measure to prevent this type of attack in the future, we'll apply an Autopilot constraint in an upcoming release that prevents updates to the service account of various objects in the kube-system namespace. We developed a Gatekeeper policy for you to apply similar protection to GKE Standard clusters and GKE clusters to prevent privileged workload self-modification. This policy is applied automatically for Autopilot clusters.
For instructions, refer to the following hardening guides:
GKE Standard
GKE on VMware
Google Distributed Cloud Virtual for Bare Metal
Update 2022-03-15: GKE on AWS
Update 2022-03-15: GKE on Azure
Addition 2022-03-15: Persistence using mutating webhooks
Mutating webhooks were used in the report to establish a privileged foothold in the cluster post-compromise. These are standard parts of the Kubernetes API created by cluster admins, and were made visible to administrators when Autopilot added support for customer-defined webhooks.
Privileged service accounts in the default namespace
Autopilot policy enforcers previously allowlisted two service accounts in the default namespace: csi-attacher and otelsvc to give the service accounts special privileges. An attacker with high privileges, including permissions to create ClusterRoleBinding objects and with access to create pods in the default namespace, could use these service account names to access those additional privileges. These services were moved under the kube-system namespace to get the protection of existing Autopilot policy. GKE Standard clusters and GKE clusters are unaffected.
What should I do?
All GKE Autopilot clusters have had their policies updated to remove the unintended host access and no further action is required .
Further policy hardening will be applied to Autopilot in the coming weeks as a secondary protection. No action is required.
GKE Standard clusters and GKE clusters are unaffected as users already have access to the host. As a system hardening measure, GKE Standard clusters and GKE clusters users can apply similar protection with a Gatekeeper policy that prevents privileged workload self-modification.

2022-05-16 Update:
In addition to the GKE versions mentioned in the 2022-05-12 update, GKE version 1.19.16-gke.7800 or later also contains code that fixes this vulnerability.
2022-05-12 Update:
The following versions of GKE contain code that fixes this
vulnerability:
1.20.15-gke.5600 or later
1.21.11-gke.1500 or later
1.22.8-gke.1800 or later
1.23.5-gke.1800 or later
Update 2022-02-15: Corrected gVisor statement.
The vulnerability is found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write
in the kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function and can be used as a container
breakout. GKE is unaffected due to protection from the default AppArmor
profile on Ubuntu and COS. However, some customers may still be vulnerable if they have
loosened security restrictions on pods through modification of the Pod or container
securityContext field e.g. by disabling/changing the AppArmor profile, which is not
recommended. In addition to the default AppArmor profile, these features also protect
against the vulnerability:
GKE Autopilot is unaffected due to the
default seccomp profile.
Update 2022-02-15: gVisor ( GKE Sandbox ) is
unaffected as gVisor doesn't allow access to the vulnerable system call on the host.
Patches will be available in an upcoming release. This bulletin will be updated when
they are available.

GKE
Description
Severity
Update 2022-02-15: Some GKE versions mentioned in the original
bulletin were combined with other fixes and had their version numbers incremented prior to release. Patches are available in the following GKE
versions:
1.20.15-gke.300
1.21.9-gke.300
1.22.6-gke.1000
A security vulnerability, CVE-2021-43527, has been discovered in any binary that links to
the vulnerable versions of libnss3 found in NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior
to 3.73 or 3.68.1. Applications using NSS for certificate validation or other TLS, X.509,
OCSP or CRL functionality may be impacted, depending on how NSS is used/configured. Both
GKE COS and Ubuntu images have a vulnerable version installed, and need to be
patched.
Potentially, CVE-2021-43527 can have a wide impact across applications using NSS for
handling signatures encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS#7, or PKCS#12. As well as
applications using NSS for certificate validation or other TLS, X.509, OCSP or CRL
functionality may be impacted. Impact depends on how NSS is used/configured.
GKE doesn't use libnss3 for any Internet-accessible APIs. The impact is
limited to on-host code running outside containers, which is small due to the minimal design
of Chrome OS. GKE code running inside containers using the golang distroless
base image is unaffected.
What should I do?
The versions of Linux node images for the following versions of GKE have
been updated with code to fix these vulnerabilities. Upgrade your control plane and nodes to one of the
following GKE versions:
1.18 version to be determined
1.19.16-gke.6100
1.20.15-gke.200
1.21.9-gke.200
1.22.6-gke.600
1.23.3-gke.500
Are you using a GKE version older than 1.18? You are using a
GKE version

Severity
A security vulnerability, CVE-2021-4034 , has been discovered in pkexec, a part of the Linux policy kit package (polkit), that allows an authenticated user to perform a privilege escalation attack. PolicyKit is generally used only on Linux desktop systems to allow non-root users to perform actions such as rebooting the system, installing packages, restarting services etc, as governed by a policy.
The GKE Enterprise default configuration already gives users full "sudo" privileges, so this exploit does not change GKE Enterprise existing security posture
Technical details
For this bug to be exploitable, an attacker needs both a non-root shell on the node filesystem and to have the vulnerable version of pkexec installed. While GKE on VMware does include a version of policykit-1 in its release images, the GKE Enterprise default configuration allows passwordless sudo to anyone with shell access already, so this vulnerability does not give a user any more privileges than they already have.

Description
Severity
Three security vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-4154 ,
CVE-2021-22600 ,
and CVE-2022-0185 ,
have been discovered in the Linux kernel, each of which can lead to either a container breakout, privilege escalation on the host, or both. These vulnerabilities affect all node operating systems (COS and Ubuntu) on GKE, GKE on VMware, GKE on AWS (current and previous generation), and GKE on Azure.
Pods using GKE Sandbox are not vulnerable to these vulnerabilities.
See the COS release notes for more details.
Technical details
In CVE-2021-4154 , an attacker can exploit the fsconfig system call parameter to trigger
a use-after-free bug in the linux kernel, resulting in getting root privileges. This is a
local privilege escalation attack that will lead to a container breakout.
CVE-2021-22600 is a double free exploit in packet_set_ring that can lead to a container
escape to the host node.
With CVE-2022-0185 , a heap overflow bug in legacy_parse_param() may lead to an
out-of-bounds write that will cause a container breakout.
The exploitation path for this vulnerability that relies on the "unshare" syscall is
blocked on GKE Autopilot clusters by default using seccomp filtering.
Users who have
manually enabled the default container runtime seccomp profile on GKE Standard clusters are also protected.
What should I do?

jq -r '.items[] | select(.spec.securityPolicy == {}) | .metadata | "\(.namespace)/\(.name)"'
If the response returns output: your cluster is impacted by the issue.
The output of this command returns a list of BackendConfig resources (<namespace>/<name>)
that are affected by the issue.
If the output is empty: your BackendConfig has not been
updated using the v1beta1 API since the issue has been introduced. Any future
updates to your BackendConfig should only use v1 .
This issue affects the following GKE versions:
1.18.19-gke.1400 to 1.18.20-gke.5100 (exclusive)
1.19.10-gke.700 to 1.19.14-gke.300 (exclusive)
1.20.6-gke.700 to 1.20.9-gke.900 (exclusive)
1.21 to 1.21.1-gke.2700 (exclusive)
If you do not configure Google Cloud Armor on your Ingress resources via the BackendConfig ,
then this issue does not affect your clusters.
What should I do?
Upgrade your GKE control plane to one of the following updated versions that
patches this issue and allows v1beta1 BackendConfig resources to
be used safely:
1.21.1-gke.2700 and later
1.20.9-gke.900 and later
1.19.14-gke.300 and later
1.18.20-gke.5100 and later
This issue can also be prevented by avoiding the deployment of v1beta1
BackendConfig resources. If you configure Google Cloud Armor on your Ingress resources
via the BackendConfig and you've found that you're impacted through the steps above,
re-enable Google Cloud Armor by pushing an update to your current BackendConfig resource
with the cloud.google.com/v1 API version.
To prevent this issue, only make updates to your BackendConfig using the
v1 BackendConfig API .
Since the v1 BackendConfig supports all the same fields as v1beta1
and makes no breaking changes, the API field can be updated transparently. To do so, replace the apiVersion field of any active BackendConfig manifest with cloud.google.com/v1
and do not use cloud.google.com/v1beta1 .
The following sample manifest describes a BackendConfig resource that uses the
v1 API:
apiVersion: cloud.google.com/v1
kind: BackendConfig
metadata:
name: my-backend-config
spec:
securityPolicy:
name: "ca-how-to-security-policy"
If you have CI/CD systems or tools which regularly update BackendConfig resources,
ensure that you are using the cloud.google.com/v1 API group in those systems

Description
Severity
A vulnerability has been discovered in the GKE Enterprise Identity Service
(AIS) LDAP module of GKE on VMware versions 1.8 and 1.8.1 where a
seed key used in generating keys is predictable. With this
vulnerability, an authenticated user could add arbitrary claims and
escalate privileges indefinitely.
Technical details
A recent addition to AIS code creates symmetric keys using golang's
math/rand module, which is not suitable for security-sensitive code.
The module is used in a way that will generate a predictable key.
During identity verification, a secure token service (STS) key is
generated that is subsequently encrypted with a symmetric key that is
simple to derive.
What should I do?
This vulnerability only affects customers using AIS in
GKE on VMware versions 1.8 and 1.8.1. For users of
GKE on VMware 1.8, upgrade your clusters to the following
version:

The Istio project recently disclosed a new security vulnerability ( CVE-2021-34824 ) affecting Istio . Istio contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where credentials specified in the Gateway and DestinationRule credentialName field can be accessed from different namespaces.
Technical details:
The Istio secure Gateway or workloads using the DestinationRule can load TLS private keys and certificates from Kubernetes secrets via the credentialName configuration. From Istio 1.8 and above, the secrets are read from istiod and conveyed to gateways and workloads via XDS.
Normally, a gateway or workload deployment is only able to access TLS certificates and private keys stored in the secret within its namespace. However, a bug in istiod allows a client authorized to access the Istio XDS API to retrieve any TLS certificate and private keys cached in istiod.

GKE clusters do not run Istio by default and, when enabled, use Istio version 1.6, which is not vulnerable to this attack. If you have installed or upgraded Istio on the cluster to Istio 1.8 or above, upgrade your Istio to the latest supported version.

GKE
Description
Severity
The Envoy and Istio projects recently announced
several new security vulnerabilities ( CVE-2021-28683 ,
CVE-2021-28682
and CVE-2021-29258 ),
that could allow an attacker to crash Envoy.
GKE clusters do not run Istio by default and are not vulnerable. If
Istio has been installed in a cluster and configured to expose services to the internet,
those services may be vulnerable to denial of service.
What should I do?
To fix these vulnerabilities, upgrade your GKE control plane
to one of the following patched versions:
1.16.15-gke.16200
1.17.17-gke.6100
1.18.17-gke.1300

GKE
Description
Severity
The Kubernetes project recently
announced a new security vulnerability,
CVE-2021-25735 , that could allow node updates to bypass a Validating Admission Webhook.
In a scenario where an attacker has sufficient privileges and where a Validating
Admission Webhook is implemented that uses old Node object properties (for
example fields in Node.NodeSpec ), the attacker could update properties of a
node that could lead to a cluster compromise. None of the policies enforced by GKE
and Kubernetes built-in admission controllers are affected, but we recommend customers
check any additional admission webhooks they have installed.
What should I do?
To fix this vulnerability, upgrade your GKE cluster to
one of the following patched versions:

GKE
Description
Severity
A vulnerability was recently discovered in the Linux utility sudo ,
described in CVE-2021-3156 ,
that may allow an attacker with unprivileged local shell access on a
system with sudo installed to escalate their privileges to root on the
system.
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters are not affected by this vulnerability:
Users who are authorized to SSH to GKE nodes are already considered
highly privileged and can use sudo to obtain root privileges by design. The
vulnerability does not yield any additional privilege escalation paths in this scenario.
Most GKE system containers are built from
distroless base images
which do not have a shell or sudo installed. Other images are built from a
debian base image that doesn't contain sudo . Even if sudo was
present, access to sudo inside the container does not give you access
to the host due to the container boundary.
What should I do?
Because GKE clusters are not affected by this vulnerability, no further
action is required.
GKE will have the patch for this vulnerability applied in a coming release
at regular cadence.

For more information, see
Hardening your cluster's security .
The Kubernetes project recently discovered
a new security vulnerability,
CVE-2020-8554 ,
that might allow an attacker who has obtained permissions to create a Kubernetes Service of
type LoadBalancer or ClusterIP to intercept network traffic originating from other Pods in
the cluster.
This vulnerability by itself does not give an attacker permissions to
create a Kubernetes Service.
All Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters are affected by this vulnerability.
What should I do?
Kubernetes might need to make backwards incompatible design changes in a future version to
address the vulnerability.
If many users share access to your cluster with permissions to create Services, such as in
a multi-tenant cluster, consider applying a mitigation in the meantime. For now, the best
approach for mitigation is to restrict the use of ExternalIPs in a cluster. ExternalIPs are
not a commonly used feature.
Restrict the use of ExternalIPs in a cluster with one of
the following methods:
Use GKE Enterprise Policy Controller or Gatekeeper with this
constraint template
and apply it. For example:
# Only allow the creation of Services with no
# ExternalIP or an ExternalIP of 203.0.113.1:
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sExternalIPs
metadata:
name: external-ips
spec:
match:
kinds:
- apiGroups: [""]
kinds: ["Service"]
parameters:
allowedIPs:
- "203.0.113.1"
Or install an admission controller to prevent the use of ExternalIPs.
The Kubernetes project has provided a
sample admission controller
for this task.
As mentioned in the
Kubernetes announcement ,
no mitigation is provided for Services of type LoadBalancer because, by default, only highly
privileged users and system components are granted the container.services.updateStatus
permission
which is required to leverage this vulnerability.

GKE
Description
Severity
A networking vulnerability, CVE-2020-8558 ,
was recently discovered in Kubernetes. Services sometimes communicate
with other applications running inside the same Pod using the local
loopback interface (127.0.0.1). This vulnerability allows an attacker
with access to the cluster's network to send traffic to the loopback
interface of adjacent Pods and nodes. Services that rely on the loopback
interface not being accessible outside their Pod could be exploited.
Exploiting this vulnerability on GKE clusters
requires an attacker to have network administrator privileges on the
Google Cloud hosting the cluster's VPC. This vulnerability
alone does not give an attacker network administrator privileges. For
this reason, this vulnerability has been assigned a Low severity for
GKE.
What should I do?
To fix this vulnerability, upgrade
your cluster's node pools to the following GKE versions
(and later):
1.17.7-gke.0
1.16.11-gke.0
1.16.10-gke.11
1.16.9-gke.14

Exploiting this vulnerability on user clusters requires an attacker to disable
source destination checks
on the EC2 instances in the cluster. This requires the attacker to have AWS IAM permissions
for ModifyInstanceAttribute or ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute on
the EC2 instances. For this reason, this vulnerability has been assigned a Low severity for
GKE on AWS.

GKE
Description
Severity
A privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2020-8559 ,
was recently discovered in Kubernetes. This vulnerability allows an
attacker that has already compromised a node to execute a command in any
Pod in the cluster. The attacker can thereby use the already compromised
node to compromise other nodes and potentially read information, or
cause destructive actions.
Note that for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability, a node in your
cluster must have already been compromised. This vulnerability, by itself,
will not compromise any nodes in your cluster.
What should I do?
Upgrade
your cluster to a patched version. Clusters will be
auto-upgraded over the next weeks, and patched versions will be
available by July 19, 2020 for an accelerated manual upgrade schedule.
The following GKE control plane versions or newer
contain the fix for this vulnerability:

Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability,
CVE-2020-8555 ,
was recently discovered in Kubernetes, allowing certain authorized
users to leak up to 500 bytes of sensitive information from the
control plane host network. The Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) control

What vulnerability is addressed by this patch?
These patches mitigate vulnerability CVE-2020-8555. This is rated
as a Medium vulnerability for GKE as it was difficult
to exploit due to various control plane hardening measures.
An attacker with permissions to create a Pod with certain
built-in Volume types (GlusterFS, Quobyte, StorageFS, ScaleIO) or
permissions to create a StorageClass can cause
kube-controller-manager to make GET requests or
POST requests without an attacker controlled request
body from the master's host network. These volume types are rarely used on
GKE, so new use of these volume types may be a
useful detection signal.
Combined with a means to leak the results of the GET/POST
back to the attacker, such as through logs, this can lead to disclosure
of sensitive information. We have updated the storage drivers in
question to remove the potential for such leaks.
