Standard
This page describes how to configure a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster to
send metrics emitted by the Kubernetes API server, Scheduler, and Controller
Manager to Cloud Monitoring using Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus. This page
also describes how these metrics are formatted when they are written to
Monitoring, and how to query metrics.
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure that you have performed the following tasks:
Enable
the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
Enable Google Kubernetes Engine API
If you want to use the Google Cloud CLI for this task,
install and then
initialize the
gcloud CLI. If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest
version by running the gcloud components update command. Earlier gcloud CLI versions might not support running the commands in this document.
Note: For existing gcloud CLI
installations, make sure to set the compute/region property . If you use primarily zonal clusters, set the compute/zone instead. By setting a default location,
you can avoid errors in the gcloud CLI like the following:
One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location . You might need to specify the location in certain commands if the location of your cluster differs from the default that you set.
Requirements
Sending metrics emitted by Kubernetes control plane components to
Cloud Monitoring has the following requirements:
The cluster must have
system metrics
enabled.
Configure collection of control plane metrics
You can enable control plane metrics in an existing GKE cluster
using the Google Cloud console, the gcloud CLI or Terraform.
Console
You can enable control plane metrics for a cluster either from the
Observability tab for the cluster or from Details tab for the
cluster. When you use the Observability tab, you can preview the
available charts and metrics before you enable the metric package.
To enable control plane metrics from the Observability tab for the
cluster, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Kubernetes clusters page:
Go to Kubernetes clusters
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Kubernetes Engine .
Click your cluster's name and then select the Observability
tab.
Select Control Plane from the list of features.
Click Enable package .
If the control plane metrics are already enabled, then you see
a set of charts for control plane metrics instead.
To enable control plane metrics from the Details tab for the cluster,
do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Kubernetes clusters page:
Go to Kubernetes clusters
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Kubernetes Engine .
Click your cluster's name.
In the Features row labelled Cloud Monitoring ,
click the Edit icon.
In the Edit Cloud Monitoring dialog that appears, confirm that
Enable Cloud Monitoring is selected.
In the Components drop-down menu, select the control plane components
from which you would like to collect metrics: API Server ,
Scheduler , or Controller Manager .
Click OK .
Click Save Changes .
gcloud
Update your cluster to collect metrics emitted by the Kubernetes API server,
Scheduler, and Controller Manager:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = COMPUTE_LOCATION \
--monitoring = SYSTEM,API_SERVER,SCHEDULER,CONTROLLER_MANAGER
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
COMPUTE_LOCATION : the
Compute Engine location
of the cluster.
Terraform
To configure the collection of Kubernetes control plane metrics by using Terraform,
see the monitoring_config block in the
Terraform registry for google_container_cluster .
For general information about using Google Cloud with Terraform, see
Terraform with Google Cloud .
Quota
Control plane metrics consume the "Time series ingestion requests per minute"
quota of the Cloud Monitoring API. Before enabling the metrics packages,
check your recent peak usage
of that quota. If you have many clusters in the same project or are already
approaching that quota limit, you can
request a quota limit increase
before enabling either observability package.
Pricing
GKE control plane metrics use
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus to load
metrics into Cloud Monitoring. Cloud Monitoring charges for the ingestion
of these metrics are based on the number of samples ingested.
For more information, see
Cloud Monitoring pricing .
Metric format
All Kubernetes Kubernetes control plane metrics written to Cloud Monitoring
use the resource type
prometheus_target .
Each metric name is prefixed with
prometheus.googleapis.com/ and has a suffix indicating the
Prometheus metric type, such as /gauge , /histogram ,
or /counter . Otherwise, each metric name is
identical to the metric name exposed by open source Kubernetes.
Exporting from Cloud Monitoring
The Kubernetes control plane metrics can be exported from Cloud Monitoring by
using the Cloud Monitoring API .
Because all Kubernetes control plane metrics are ingested by using
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus ,
Kubernetes control plane metrics can be queried
by using Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) . They can also be queried by
using by using Monitoring Query Language (MQL) .
Querying metrics
When you query Kubernetes control plane metrics, the name you use depends on
whether you are using PromQL or Cloud Monitoring-based features like
MQL or the Metrics Explorer
menu-driven interface .
The following tables of Kubernetes control plane metrics show two versions of
each metric name:
PromQL metric name : When
using PromQL in Cloud Monitoring pages
of the Google Cloud console or in PromQL fields of the
Cloud Monitoring API ,
use the PromQL metric name.
Cloud Monitoring metric name When using other
Cloud Monitoring features, use the Cloud Monitoring metric name
in the tables below. This name must be prefixed with
prometheus.googleapis.com/ , which has been omitted from the
entries in the table.
API server metrics
This section provides a list of the API server metrics and additional
information about interpreting and using the metrics.
List of API server metrics
When API server metrics are enabled, all metrics shown in the following table
are exported to Cloud Monitoring in the same project as the
GKE cluster.
The Cloud Monitoring metric names in this table must be prefixed with
prometheus.googleapis.com/ . That prefix has been omitted from the
entries in the table.

This following sections provide additional information about the API server
metrics.
apiserver_request_duration_seconds
Use this metric to monitor latency in the API server. The request duration
recorded by this metric includes all phases of request processing, from the time
the request is received to the time the server completes its response to the
client. Specifically, it includes time spent on the following:
The authentication and authorization of the request.
Calling the third-party and system webhooks associated with the request.
Fetching the requested object from an in-memory cache (for requests
specifying a resourceVersion URL parameter) or from the
etcd- or Spanner-based cluster state database by calling the
etcd API (for all other requests).
You can use the group , version ,
resource , and subresource labels to uniquely
identify a slow request for further investigation.
Writing the response to the client and receiving the client's response.
For more information about using this metric, see
Latency .
This metric has very high cardinality. When using this metric, you must use
filters or grouping to find specific sources of latency.
apiserver_admission_controller_admission_duration_seconds
This metric measures the latency in built-in admission webhooks, not
third-party webhooks. To diagnose latency issues with third-party webooks, use
the
apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds
metric.
apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds and apiserver_admission_step_admission_duration_seconds
These metrics measure the latency in external, third-party admission webhooks.
The apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds metric
is generally the more useful metric. For more information about using this
metric, see Latency .
apiserver_request_total
Use this metric to monitor the request traffic at your API server. You can also
use it to determine the success and failure rates of your requests. For more
information about using this metric, see
Traffic and error rate .
This metric has very high cardinality. When using this metric, you must use
filters or grouping to identify sources of errors.
apiserver_storage_objects
Use this metric to detect saturation of your system and to identify possible
resource leaks. For more information, see
Saturation .
apiserver_current_inflight_requests
This metric records the maximum number of requests that were being actively
served in the last one-second window. For more information, see
Saturation .
The metric does not include long-running requests like "watch".
Monitoring the API server
The API server metrics can give you insight into the main signals for system
health:
Latency : How long does it take to service
a request?
Traffic : How much demand is the system
experiencing?
Error rate : How often to requests fail?
Saturation : How full is the system?
This section describes how to use the API server metrics to monitor the health
of your API server.
Latency
When the API server is overloaded, request latency increases. To measure the
latency of requests to the API server, use the
apiserver_request_duration_seconds
metric. To identify the source of latency more specifically, you can group
metrics by the verb or resource label.
The suggested upper bound for a single-resource call such as GET, POST, or PATCH
is one second. The suggested upper bound for both namespace-scoped and
cluster-scoped LIST calls is 30 seconds. The upper-bound expectations are set by
SLOs that are defined by the open source Kubernetes community. For more
information, see
API call latency SLIs/SLOs details .
If the value of the
apiserver_request_duration_seconds
metric is increasing beyond the expected duration, investigate the following
possible causes:
The Kubernetes control plane might be overloaded. To check, look at the
apiserver_request_total and
apiserver_storage_objects
metrics.
Use the code label to determine whether requests are
being processed successfully. For information about the possible
values, see
HTTP Status codes .
Use the group , version , resource ,
and subresource labels to uniquely identify a request.
A third-party admission webhook is slow or non-responsive.
If the value of the
apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds metric
is increasing, then some of your third-party or
user-defined admission webhooks are slow or non-responsive. Latency in
admission webhook can cause delays in job scheduling.
To query the 99th percentile webhook latency per instance of the
Kubernetes control plane, use the following PromQL query:
sum by (instance) (histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds_bucket{cluster=" CLUSTER_NAME "}[1m])))
We recommend also looking at the 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99.9th
percentiles; you can adjust this query by modifying the 0.99 value.
External webhooks have a timeout limit of approximately 10 seconds.
You can set alerting policies on the
apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds
metric to alert you when you are approaching the webhook timeout.
You can also group the
apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds
metric on the name label to diagnose possible issues with
specific webhooks.
You are listing a lot of objects. It is expected that the latency of
LIST calls increases as the number of objects of a given type (the response
size) increases.
Client-side problems:
The client might not have enough resources to receive responses
in a timely manner. To check, look at CPU usage metrics for the client
pod.
The client has a slow network connection. This might happen when the
client is running on a device like a mobile phone, but it's unlikely
for clients running on a Compute Engine network.
The client has exited unexpectedly but the TCP connection has
a timeout period in tens of seconds. Before the connection times out,
the server's resources are blocked, which can increase latency.
For more information, see
Good practices for using API Priority and Fairness
in the Kubernetes documentation.
Traffic and error rate
To measure the traffic and the number of successful and failed requests at the
API server, use the
apiserver_request_total metric. For
example, to measure the API server traffic per instance of the Kubernetes
control plane, use the following PromQL query:
sum by (instance) (increase(apiserver_request_total{cluster=" CLUSTER_NAME "}[1m]))
To query the unsuccessful requests, filter the code label for
4xx and 5xx values by using the following PromQL query:
sum(rate(apiserver_request_total{code=~"[45].."}[5m]))
To query the successful requests, filter the code label for
2xx values by using the following PromQL query:
sum(rate(apiserver_request_total{code=~"2.."}[5m]))
To query the rejected requests by the API server per instance of the
Kubernetes control plane, filter the
code label for the value 429 ( http.StatusTooManyRequests )
by using the following PromQL query:
sum by (instance) (increase(apiserver_request_total{cluster=" CLUSTER_NAME ", code="429"}[1m]))
Saturation
You can measure the saturation in your system by using the
apiserver_current_inflight_requests
and apiserver_storage_objects
metrics.
If the value of the apiserver_storage_objects
metric is increasing, you might be experiencing a problem with a custom
controller that creates objects but doesn't delete them. You can filter or group
the metric by the resource label to identify the resource
experiencing/ the increase.
Evaluate the apiserver_current_inflight_requests metric in
accordance with your API Priority and Fairness settings; these settings affect
how requests are prioritized, so you can't draw conclusions from the metric
values alone. For more information, see
API Priority and Fairness .

about interpreting and using the metrics.

This following sections provide additional information about the API server
metrics.
scheduler_pending_pods
You can use the scheduler_pending_pods metric to monitor the load
on your scheduler. Increasing values in this metric can indicate resourcing
problems. The scheduler has three queues, and this metric reports the number of
pending requests by queue. The following queues are supported:
active queue
The set of pods that the scheduler is attempting to schedule; the pod
with the highest priority is at the head of the queue.
backoff queue
The set of pods were unschedulable the last time the scheduler tried
but which might be schedulable the next time.
Pods on this queue must wait for a backoff period (a maximum of 10
seconds), after which they are moved back to the active
queue for another scheduling attempt. For more information on the
management of the backoff queue,
see the implementation request,
Kubernetes issue 75417 .
unschedulable set
The set of pods that the scheduler attempted to schedule but which
have been determined to be unschedulable. Placement
on this queue might indicate readiness or compatibility issues with your
nodes or the configuration of your node selectors.
When resource constraints prevent pods from being scheduled, the pods are
not subject to back-off handling. Instead, when a cluster is full, new
pods fail to be scheduled and are put on the unscheduled
queue.
The presence of unscheduled pods might indicate that you have
insufficient resources or that you have a node-configuration problem.
Pods are moved to either the backoff or active
queue after events that change the cluster state. Pods on this queue
indicate that nothing has changed in the cluster that would make the
pods schedulable.
Affinities
define rules for how pods are assigned to nodes. The use of affinity
or anti-affinity rules can be a reason for an increase in unscheduled
pods.
Some events, for example, PVC/Service ADD/UPDATE, termination of a pod,
or the registration of new nodes, move some or all unscheduled
pods to either the backoff or active queue.
For more information, see
Kubernetes issue 81214 .
For more information, see Scheduler latency and
Resource issues .
scheduler_scheduling_attempt_duration_seconds
This metric measures the duration of a single scheduling attempt within the
scheduler itself and is broken down by the result: scheduled, unschedulable, or
error. The duration runs from the time the scheduler picks up a pod until the
time the scheduler locates a node and places the pod on the node, determines
that the pod is unschedulable, or encounters an error. The scheduling duration
includes the time in the scheduling process as well as the binding time. Binding
is the process in which the scheduler communicates its node assignment to the
API server. For more information, see Scheduler latency .
This metric doesn't capture the time the pod spends in admission control or
validation.
For more information about scheduling, see
Scheduling a Pod .
scheduler_schedule_attempts_total
This metric measures the number of scheduling attempts; each attempt to schedule
a pod increases the value. You can use this metric to determine if the scheduler
is available: if the value is increasing, then the scheduler is operational. You
can use the result label to determine the success; pods are either
scheduled or unschedulable .
This metric correlates strongly with the scheduler_pending_pods
metric: when there are many pending pods, you can expect to see many attempts to
schedule the pods. For more information, see Resource
issues .
This metric doesn't increase if the scheduler has no pods to schedule, which can
be the case if you have a custom secondary scheduler.
scheduler_preemption_attempts_total and scheduler_preemptions_victims
You can use preemption metrics to help determine if you need to add resources.
You might have higher-priority pods that can't be scheduled because there is no
room for them. In this case, the scheduler frees up resources by preempting one
or more running pods on a node. The scheduler_preemption_attempts_total
metric tracks the number of times the scheduler has tried to preempt pods.
The scheduler_preemptions_victims metric counts the pods selected
for preemption.
The number of preemption attempts correlates strongly with the value of the scheduler_schedule_attempts_total
metric when the value of the result label is
unschedulable .
The two values aren't equivalent: for example, if a cluster has 0 nodes, there
are no preemption attempts but there might be scheduling attempts that fail.
For more information, see Resource issues .
Monitoring the scheduler
The scheduler metrics can give you insight into the performance of your
scheduler:
Scheduler latency : Is the scheduler running? How
long does it take to schedule pods?
Resource issues : Are attempts to schedule pods
hitting resource constraints?
This section describes how to use the scheduler metric to monitor your
scheduler.
Scheduler latency
The scheduler's task is to ensure that your pods run, so you want to know
when the scheduler is stuck or running slowly.
To verify that the scheduler is running and scheduling pods, use the
scheduler_schedule_attempts_total metric.
When the scheduler is running slowly, investigate the following possible
causes:
The number of pending pods is increasing. Use the
scheduler_pending_pods metric
to monitor the number of pending pods. The following PromQL query
returns the number of pending pods per queue in a cluster:
sum by (queue)
(delta(scheduler_pending_pods{cluster=" CLUSTER_NAME "}[2m]))
Individual attempts to schedule pods are slow. Use the
scheduler_scheduling_attempt_duration_seconds
metric to monitor the latency of scheduling attempts.
We recommend observing this metric at least at the 50th and 95th
percentiles. The following PromQL query retrieves 95th percentile values
but can be adjusted:
sum by (instance) (histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(
scheduler_scheduling_attempt_duration_seconds_bucket{cluster=" CLUSTER_NAME "}[5m])))
Resource issues
The scheduler metrics can also help you assess whether you have sufficient
resources. If the value of the
scheduler_preemption_attempts_total metric
is increasing, then check the value of
scheduler_preemption_victims by using the following PromQL
query:
scheduler_preemption_victims_sum{cluster=" CLUSTER_NAME "}
The number of preemption attempts and the number of preemption victims both
increase when there are higher priority pods to schedule. The preemption metrics
don't tell you whether the high-priority pods that triggered the preemptions
were scheduled, so when you see increases in the value of the preemption
metrics, you can also monitor the value of the
scheduler_pending_pods metric. If the number of pending
pods is also increasing, then you might not have sufficient resources to handle
the higher-priority pods; you might need to scale up the available resources,
create new pods with reduced resource claims, or change the node selector.
If the number of preemption victims is not increasing, then
there are no remaining pods with low priority that can be removed.
In this case, consider adding more nodes so the new pods can be
allocated.
If the number of preemption victims is increasing, then there
are higher-priority pods waiting to be scheduled, so the scheduler
is preempting some of the running pods. The preemption metrics
don't tell you whether the higher priority pods have been scheduled
successfully.
To determine if the higher-priority pods are being scheduled,
look for decreasing values of the scheduler_pending_pods
metric. If the value of this metric is increasing, then you might
need to add more nodes.
You can expect to see temporary spikes in the values for the
scheduler_pending_pods metric when workloads are going to be
scheduled in your cluster, for example, during events like updates or scalings.
If you have sufficient resources in your cluster, these spikes are temporary.
If the number of pending pods doesn't go down, do the following:
Check that nodes are not cordoned; cordoned nodes don't accept new pods.
Check the following scheduling directives, which can be misconfigured and
might render a pod unschedulable:
Node affinity and selector.
Taints and tolerations.
Pod topology-spread constraints.
If pods can't be scheduled because of insufficient resources, then
consider freeing up some of the existing nodes or increasing the number of
nodes.
Controller Manager metrics
When controller manager metrics are enabled, all metrics shown in the following
table are exported to Cloud Monitoring in the same project as the
GKE cluster.
The Cloud Monitoring metric names in this table must be prefixed with
prometheus.googleapis.com/ . That prefix has been omitted from the
entries in the table.
PromQL metric name Launch stage
