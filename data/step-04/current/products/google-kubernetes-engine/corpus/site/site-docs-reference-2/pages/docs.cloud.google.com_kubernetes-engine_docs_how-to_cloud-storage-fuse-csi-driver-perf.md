Standard
This guide shows you how to optimize the performance of the Cloud Storage FUSE
CSI driver on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
For a simplified, automated way to optimize Cloud Storage FUSE performance
for AI/ML workloads, see
Automate performance tuning with Cloud Storage FUSE profiles .
The manual steps in this document are for advanced users, or to address custom needs not
covered by the profiles.
While Cloud Storage FUSE offers flexibility and scalability, careful configuration
and tuning are crucial to achieve optimal performance. The performance of
Cloud Storage FUSE can differ from a POSIX file system in terms of latency,
throughput, and consistency. The goal of tuning is to minimize the overhead of
metadata operations and maximize the efficiency of data access. If you are
running AI/ML applications that consume data in Cloud Storage buckets, tuning
the CSI driver can lead to faster training and inference times for your
AI/ML applications.
This guide is for Developers and Machine learning (ML) engineers who want
to improve the performance of their applications that access data stored in
Cloud Storage buckets .
Before reading this page, ensure you're familiar with the basics of
Cloud Storage, Kubernetes, and the Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver. Make sure
to also check the GKE version requirements for specific features you want to use.
Configure mount options
The Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver supports mount options to configure how
Cloud Storage buckets are mounted on your local file system.
Note: The Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver's mountOptions field is designed to flexibly
accept strings based on either the CLI option names (for example, file-cache-enable-parallel-downloads=true )
or the configuration file key
structure (for example, file-cache:enable-parallel-downloads:true ). This approach lets you use the format you find most convenient.
You don't need to supply a separate configuration file; these options are parsed
directly by the driver.
For the full
list of supported mount options, see the
Cloud Storage FUSE CLI and
Cloud Storage FUSE configuration file .
You can specify mount options in the following ways, depending on the type of
volume you are using:
CSI ephemeral volume
If you use CSI ephemeral volumes , specify the mount options in the
spec.volumes[n].csi.volumeAttributes.mountOptions field of your Pod
manifest.
You must specify the mount options as a string, with flags separated by
commas and without spaces. For example:
mountOptions : "implicit-dirs,file-cache:enable-parallel-downloads:true,file-cache:download-chunk-size-mb:3"
Persistent volume
If you use persistent volumes , specify the mount options in the
spec.mountOptions field in your PersistentVolume manifest.
You must specify the mount options as a list. For example:
mountOptions :
- implicit-dirs
- file-cache:enable-parallel-downloads:true
- file-cache:download-chunk-size-mb:3
Mount considerations
Use the following considerations when configuring mounts with the CSI driver:
General considerations
The following flags are disallowed: app-name , temp-dir , foreground ,
log-file , log-format , key-file , token-url , and reuse-token-from-url .
Cloud Storage FUSE doesn't make implicit directories visible by default.
If you only want to mount a directory in the bucket instead of the entire
bucket, pass the directory relative path by using the
only-dir=relative/path/to/the/bucket/root flag.
Security and permissions
If you use a Security Context for your Pod or container, or if your container image uses a
non-root user or group, you must set the uid and gid mount flags. You also
need to use the file-mode and dir-mode mount flags to set the file system
permissions. Note that you can't run chmod , chown , or chgrp commands
against a Cloud Storage FUSE file system, so use uid , gid , file-mode , and
dir-mode mount flags to get access for a non-root user or group.
Linux kernel mount options
If you need to configure the Linux kernel mount options, you can pass the
options using the o flag. For example, if you don't want to permit direct
execution of any binaries on the mounted file system, set the o=noexec flag.
Each option requires a separate flag, for example, o=noexec , o=noatime . Only
the following options are allowed: exec , noexec , atime , noatime , sync ,
async , and dirsync .
Configure caching
This section provides an overview of caching options available with
Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver to enhance performance.
File caching
You can use the Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver with
file caching to improve the read
performance of applications that handle small files from Cloud Storage buckets.
The Cloud Storage FUSE file cache feature is a client-based read cache that
allows repeated file reads to be served more quickly from cache storage of
your choice.
You can choose from a range of storage options for the read cache,
including Local SSD, durable block storage like Google Cloud Hyperdisk or Persistent Disk,
and RAM disk (memory), based on your price-performance needs.
Enable and use file caching
By default, the file caching feature is disabled on GKE. You
must opt-in to enable file caching with the Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver.
To enable and control file caching, set the volume attribute
fileCacheCapacity or use the file-cache:max-size-mb mount option.
GKE uses an emptyDir volume by default for Cloud Storage FUSE
file caching backed by the ephemeral storage configured on the node. This could
be the boot disk attached to the node or a Local SSD on the node. If you enable
Local SSD
on the node, GKE uses the Local SSD to back the emptyDir
volume.
You can configure a custom read cache volume for the sidecar container
to replace the default emptyDir volume for file caching in read operations.
Note: If you choose to use the default emptyDir volume for file caching,
the value of Pod annotation gke-gcsfuse/ephemeral-storage-limit must be
larger than the fileCacheCapacity volume attribute or the
file-cache:max-size-mb mount option value. If a custom cache volume
is used, the underlying volume size must be larger than the
fileCacheCapacity volume attribute.
To learn more about best practices for file caching, see Cloud Storage FUSE performance .
Select the storage for backing your file cache
To select the storage for backing your file cache, refer to these considerations:
For GPU and CPU VM families that support Local SSD (for example, A3 VMs), we recommend using Local SSD.
For A3+ VMs, GKE automatically
sets up Local SSD for your Pods to consume.
If your VM family does not support Local SSD, GKE uses the boot disk
for caching. The default disk type for the boot disk on GKE is
pd-balanced .
If your VM family supports Local SSD but doesn't have the ephemeral storage
on Local SSD enabled by default, you can enable Local SSD in your node pool.
This applies to first and second generation machine families such as N1 and N2 machines.
To learn more, see Create a cluster with Local SSD .
To check if your node has ephemeral storage on Local SSD enabled, run the following command:
kubectl describe node <code><var>NODE_NAME</var></code> | grep "cloud.google.com/gke-ephemeral-storage-local-ssd"
For TPU VM families, especially v6+, we recommend using RAM as
a file cache for the best performance as these VM instances have larger RAM.
When using RAM, pay attention to out-of-memory (OOM) errors as they cause
Pod disruptions. Cloud Storage FUSE consumes memory, so setting up a file cache
to consume the sidecar container can result in OOM errors. To prevent such
scenarios, adjust your file cache configuration file-cache:max-size-mb field
to a smaller value.
For other TPU families, we recommend using pd-balanced or pd-ssd .
The default disk type for the boot disk on
GKE is pd-balanced .
Avoid using the boot disk for caching as it can lead to reduced performance
and unexpected terminations. Instead, consider using a PersistentVolume
backed by durable block storage .
Use RAM disk-based file caching
You can use RAM disk for file caching or parallel download to reduce the
overhead of using a boot disk if you are using a TPU VM
with sufficiently large RAM.
To use a RAM disk with the Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver, add the following to
your manifest:
volumes :
- name : gke-gcsfuse-cache
emptyDir :
medium : Memory
Stat cache
The Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver enhances performance by caching file metadata,
like size and modification time. The CSI driver enables this stat cache by default and reduces
latency by storing information locally instead of repeatedly requesting it from Cloud Storage. You can configure its maximum size (the default is 32 MB)
and how long the data stays in the cache (the default is 60 seconds). By fine-tuning
the metadata cache, you can reduce API calls to Cloud Storage, to improve
application performance and efficiency by minimizing network traffic and latency.
To learn more about best practices for stat caching, see the
Cloud Storage FUSE caching overview .
Use metadata prefetch to pre-populate the metadata cache
The metadata prefetch feature lets the Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver proactively
load relevant metadata about the objects in your Cloud Storage bucket into
Cloud Storage FUSE caches. This approach reduces calls to Cloud Storage and is
especially beneficial for applications accessing large datasets with many files,
such as AI/ML training workloads.
This feature requires GKE version 1.32.1-gke.1357001 or later.
This feature is not supported with Dynamic Mounting, where you specify an
underscore (_) to mount all buckets that the Kubernetes ServiceAccount can
access. If you use dynamic mounting, metadata prefetch is not performed.
To see performance gains from metadata prefetch, you must set the time to live
(TTL) value of metadata cache items to unlimited. Typically, setting a TTL prevents
cached content from becoming stale. When you set TTL to unlimited, you must
take precaution not to change the contents of the bucket out-of-band (meaning
allowing a different workload or actor to modify the workload). Out-of-band
changes are not visible locally and could cause consistency issues.
To enable metadata prefetch, make the following configuration changes. We
recommend enabling this feature on volumes that are heavily read.
Set the volume attribute gcsfuseMetadataPrefetchOnMount: true .
Update the following mount options:
metadata-cache:stat-cache-max-size-mb:-1 to unset stat cache capacity limit.
metadata-cache:type-cache-max-size-mb:-1 to unset type cache capacity limit.
file-system:kernel-list-cache-ttl-secs:-1 to prevent kernel list cache items from expiring.
metadata-cache:ttl-secs:-1
to prevent cached metadata items from expiring.
To avoid workload interruptions, consider increasing the memory limit of the gke-gcsfuse-metadata-prefetch sidecar.
Increase limits by setting Pod annotation gke-gcsfuse/metadata-prefetch-memory-limit to "512Mi" or higher. For more information, see Configure sidecar container resources .
Alternatively, unset the memory limit by setting Pod annotation gke-gcsfuse/metadata-prefetch-memory-limit to "0" (only supported for Standard Clusters).
For an example, see the code sample in
Improve large file read performance using parallel download .
List cache
To speed up directory listings for applications, you can enable list caching . This feature stores directory
listings in memory so repeated requests can be served faster. The list cache is
disable by default; you can enable it by setting the
kernel-list-cache-ttl-secs
parameter in your mount options. This defines how long listings are cached.
Note: While caching improves performance, remember that it uses memory and the
cache is invalidated when directory contents change.
Improve large file sequential reads by using buffered read
Buffered reads can improve sequential read performance for large files by asynchronously prefetching parts of a Cloud Storage object
into an in-memory buffer. Buffering allows subsequent reads to be served from the
buffer instead of requiring network calls.
Consider the following before you enable buffered reads:
Buffered reads are incompatible with file caching. If both buffered reads and
file caching are enabled, file caching takes precedence and buffered reads are ignored.
Buffered reads can use significant memory and compute resources.
To enable buffered reads, in your manifest, configure this additional
setting using mount options :
enable-buffered-read .
We recommend using the mount options :
read-global-max-blocks to specify the maximum number of blocks
available for buffered reads across all file handles.
Improve large file read performance using parallel download
You can use Cloud Storage FUSE parallel download to accelerate reading large
files from Cloud Storage for multi-threaded downloads.
Cloud Storage FUSE parallel download can be particularly beneficial for model
serving use cases with reads over 1 GB in size.
Parallel downloads require the file cache to be enabled. Starting from GKE version 1.32.0-gke.1795000, Cloud Storage FUSE strictly enforces this requirement and throws the following error if you try to use parallel downloads without the file cache, which prevents your Pod from starting: MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "gcs-fuse-csi-pv" : rpc error: code = Internal desc = gcsfuse failed with error: Error: error while parsing config: error parsing parallel download config: file cache should be enabled for parallel download support .
Common examples include:
Model serving, where you need a large prefetch buffer to accelerate model
download during instance boot.
Checkpoint restores, where you need a read-only data cache to improve
one-time access of multiple large files.
Best practice :
Use parallel download for applications that perform single-threaded large file reads. Applications with high read-parallelism
(using more than eight threads) may encounter lower performance with this feature.
To use parallel download with the Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver, follow these steps:
Create a cluster with file caching enabled, as described
in Enable and use file caching .
In your manifest, configure these additional
settings using mount options to enable parallel download:
Set file-cache:enable-parallel-downloads:true .
Adjust file-cache:parallel-downloads-per-file , file-cache:parallel-downloads-per-file ,
file-cache:max-parallel-downloads , and
file-cache:download-chunk-size-mb as needed.
(Optional) If needed, consider tuning these
volume attributes :
file-cache:cache-file-for-range-read for random or partial reads.
metadata-cache:stat-cache-max-size-mb and
metadata-cache:type-cache-max-size-mb for training workloads.
Reduce quota consumption from access control checks
By default, the CSI driver performs access control checks to ensure that the
Pod service account has access to your Cloud Storage buckets. This results in
additional overhead in the form of Kubernetes Service API, Security Token Service, and
IAM calls. Starting in GKE version 1.29.9-gke.1251000, you can
use the volume attribute skipCSIBucketAccessCheck to skip such redundant checks and
reduce quota consumption.
Inference serving example
The following example shows how to enable parallel download for inference serving:
Create a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim manifest with the
following specification:
apiVersion : v1
kind : PersistentVolume
metadata :
name : serving-bucket-pv
spec :
accessModes :

Replace the following values:
NAMESPACE : the Kubernetes namespace where
you want to deploy your Pod.
BUCKET_NAME : the Cloud Storage bucket
name you specified when configuring access to the Cloud Storage buckets.
You can specify an underscore ( _ ) to mount all buckets that the Kubernetes
ServiceAccount can access. To learn more, see
Dynamic mounting
in the Cloud Storage FUSE documentation.
Apply the manifest to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f PV_FILE_PATH
Replace PV_FILE_PATH with the path to your YAML file.
Create a Pod manifest with the following specification to consume the
PersistentVolumeClaim, depending on whether you are using Local SSD-backed
file caching or RAM disk-backed file caching:
Local SSD
apiVersion : v1
kind : Pod
metadata :

emptyDir :
medium : Memory
- name : serving-bucket-vol
persistentVolumeClaim :
claimName : serving-bucket-pvc
Apply the manifest to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f POD_FILE_PATH
Replace POD_FILE_PATH with the path to your YAML file.
Optimize DNS lookups using NodeLocal DNSCache in GKE
In GKE versions earlier than 1.34.1-gke.3899000, if you use Cloud Storage FUSE with the HTTP/1.1 protocol, the frequent establishment of new connections can lead to a high volume of DNS lookups. This behavior can impact performance, especially in GKE environments.
To optimize DNS lookups and reduce latency on earlier GKE versions, you should deploy NodeLocal DNSCache .
Standard Pods : deploying NodeLocal DNSCache automatically optimizes DNS lookups for most standard pods in your cluster.
Host network Pods : Pods that use the hostNetwork: true setting require an additional configuration change to use the NodeLocal DNSCache. You must explicitly override the dnsPolicy in the pod's specification to ClusterFirstWithHostNet .
A separate DNS cache typically isn't required in the following scenarios, because caching is handled internally:
Compute Engine VMs : the VM's operating system kernel usually caches DNS lookups effectively, negating the need for an additional caching layer.
GKE 1.34.1-gke.3899000 and later : Cloud Storage FUSE shipped with these versions provides a built-in DNS cache, which resolves the high-frequency lookup issue internally.
Configure volume attributes
Volume attributes let you configure specific behavior of the Cloud Storage FUSE
CSI driver.
The Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver doesn't allow you to directly specify the
Cloud Storage FUSE configuration file. You can configure some of the fields in the
configuration file using the Cloud Storage FUSE CSI volume attributes. The CSI
driver handles translating the volume attribute values to the configuration
file fields.
For the full list of supported volume attributes, see the
Volume attributes reference .
You can specify the volume attributes in the following ways:
In the spec.csi.volumeAttributes field on a PersistentVolume manifest, if
you use persistent volumes.
In the spec.volumes[n].csi.volumeAttributes field, if you use
CSI ephemeral volumes.
In the manifest, the volume attributes can be specified as key-value pairs.
For example:
volumeAttributes :
mountOptions : "implicit-dirs"
fileCacheCapacity : "-1"
gcsfuseLoggingSeverity : warning
Cloud Storage FUSE metrics
The following Cloud Storage FUSE metrics are now available through the GKE Monitoring API . Details about Cloud Storage FUSE metrics such as labels,
type, and unit can be found in GKE System Metrics . These metrics are available for each Pod that uses
Cloud Storage FUSE and you can use metrics to configure insights per volume and bucket.
Metrics are enabled by default starting in GKE version 1.33.0-gke.2248000 or later. To disable them, set the volume attribute
disableMetrics to "true".
File system metrics
File system metrics track the performance and health of your file system,
including the number of operations, errors, and operation speed. These metrics
can help identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
gcsfusecsi/fs_ops_count
gcsfusecsi/fs_ops_error_count
gcsfusecsi/fs_ops_latency
Cloud Storage metrics
You can monitor Cloud Storage metrics, including data volume, speed, and
request activity, to understand how your applications interact with
Cloud Storage buckets. This data can help you identify areas for
optimization, such as improving read patterns or reducing the number of requests.
gcsfusecsi/gcs_download_bytes_count
gcsfusecsi/gcs_read_count
gcsfusecsi/gcs_read_bytes_count
gcsfusecsi/gcs_reader_count
gcsfusecsi/gcs_request_count
gcsfusecsi/gcs_request_latencies
File cache metrics
You can monitor file cache metrics, including data read volume, speed, and
cache hit rate, to optimize Cloud Storage FUSE and application performance.
Analyze these metrics to improve your caching strategy and maximize cache hits.
gcsfusecsi/file_cache_read_bytes_count
gcsfusecsi/file_cache_read_latencies
gcsfusecsi/file_cache_read_count
Enable Cloud Storage FUSE performance defaults
Starting with version 1.33.2-gke.4655000, GKE automatically enables a number of performance defaults for Cloud Storage FUSE running on nodes that are backed by high-performance machine types . These performance defaults are not supported from 1.34.1-gke.1431000 to 1.34.1-gke.3403001 due to a known issue .
During volume mount, the Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver fetches the target's node instance type and passes it to Cloud Storage FUSE through a new mount option machine-type .
When it's passed a high-performance machine type, Cloud Storage FUSE automatically sets the following default mount options:
metadata-cache:negative-ttl-secs:0
metadata-cache:ttl-secs:-1
metadata-cache:stat-cache-max-size-mb:1024
metadata-cache:type-cache-max-size-mb:128
implicit-dirs:true
file-system:rename-dir-limit:200000
write:global-max-blocks:1600
If any of these mount options are explicitly specified, they won't be overwritten by the automatic defaults.
You can opt out of the feature by including disable-autoconfig in the mount options. For example:
mountOptions : "implicit-dirs,disable-autoconfig"
Best practices for performance tuning
This section lists some recommended performance tuning and optimization techniques for the Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver.
Leverage Hierarchical Namespace (HNS) buckets: Opt for HNS buckets to
achieve a substantial 8x increase in initial Queries Per Second (QPS). This
choice also facilitates swift and atomic directory renames, a crucial
requirement for efficient checkpointing with Cloud Storage FUSE. HNS buckets
ensure a better file-like experience by supporting 40,000 object read requests
and 8,000 object write requests per second, a significant improvement compared
to the 8,000 object read requests and 1,000 object write requests per second
offered by flat buckets.
Mount specific directories when possible: If your workload involves
accessing a specific directory within a bucket, use the --only-dir flag during
mounting. This focused approach expedites list calls, as it limits the scope of
LookUpInode calls, which involve a list+stat call for every file or
directory in the specified path. By narrowing the mount to the required
subdirectory, you minimize these calls, leading to performance gains.
Optimize metadata caching: Configure your metadata caches to maximize
their capacity and set an infinite time to live (TTL). This practice effectively
caches all accessed metadata for the duration of your job, minimizing metadata
access requests to Cloud Storage. This configuration proves particularly
beneficial for read-only volumes, as it eliminates repeated Cloud Storage
metadata lookups. However, verify that the memory consumption associated with
these large metadata caches aligns with your system's capabilities.
Maximize GKE sidecar resources: Cloud Storage FUSE operates
within a sidecar container in a GKE environment. To prevent resource
bottlenecks, remove limitations on CPU and memory consumption for the sidecar
container. This allows Cloud Storage FUSE to scale its resource utilization based
on workload demands, preventing throttling and ensuring optimal throughput.
Populate the metadata cache proactively: Enable metadata prefetch for
the CSI driver. This efficiently populates the metadata and list caches, minimizing
metadata calls to Cloud Storage and accelerating the initial run. Many ML
frameworks perform this automatically, but it's crucial to ensure this step for
custom training code. To learn more, see Use metadata prefetch to pre-populate the metadata cach .
Utilize file cache and parallel downloads: Enable the file cache
feature, especially for multi-epoch training workloads, where data is read
repeatedly. The file cache stores frequently accessed data on local storage
(SSD in the case of A3 machines), improving read performance. Complement this
with the parallel downloads feature, particularly for serving workloads, to
expedite the download of large files by splitting them into smaller chunks and
downloading them concurrently.
Enable buffered reads: Buffered reads can improve sequential read performance
for large files by asynchronously prefetching parts of a Cloud Storage object into an in-memory buffer. Buffering allows subsequent reads to be served
from the buffer instead of requiring network calls. For more information, see
Improve large file sequential reads using buffered read .
Optimize checkpoints: For checkpointing with Cloud Storage FUSE, we
strongly recommend using an HNS bucket. If using a non-HNS bucket, set the rename-dir-limit parameter to a high value to accommodate the directory renames often employed by
ML frameworks during checkpointing. However, be aware that directory renames in
non-HNS buckets might not be atomic and could take longer to complete.
Enable list caching: Engage list caching using the
--kernel-list-cache-ttl-secs flag to further enhance performance. This feature
caches directory and file listings, improving the speed of ls operations. List
caching is especially beneficial for workloads involving repeated full directory
listings, common in AI/ML training scenarios. It's advisable to use list caching
with read-only mounts to maintain data consistency.
Increase kernel read ahead: For workloads that primarily involve
sequential reads of large files, such as serving and checkpoint-restore,
increasing the read-ahead size can significantly enhance performance. To
increase Cloud Storage FUSE read-ahead, specify the read_ahead_kb flag in
mountOptions and set it to 1MB (e.g. read_ahead_kb=1024 ). This feature
requires GKE version 1.32.2-gke.1297001 or later. For zonal
buckets, Cloud Storage FUSE automatically manages the read_ahead_kb kernel
parameter in GKE version 1.35.0-gke.3047001 or later.
Consequently, the read_ahead_kb mount option is not applicable, and any
value provided to it will be ignored.
Enable streaming writes: Streaming writes is a new write path that uploads data directly to Cloud Storage as it's written. This approach differs from the default write method, which temporarily stages the entire write in a local directory and then uploads it to Cloud Storage upon a close or fsync operation. Streaming writes reduce both latency and disk space usage, making it particularly beneficial for large, sequential writes such as checkpoints. To enable streaming writes, specify the enable-streaming-writes command line flag in mountOptions .
