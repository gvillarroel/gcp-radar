Autopilot
Standard
This page describes the node images available for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) nodes.
GKE Autopilot nodes always use
Container-Optimized OS with containerd ( cos_containerd ), which is the
recommended node operating system. If you use GKE
Standard, you can choose the operating system image that runs on each
node during cluster or node pool creation. You can also upgrade an
existing Standard cluster to use a different node image. For
instructions on how to set the node image, see
Specifying a node image .
Available node images
GKE offers the following node image options per OS for your
cluster:
OS
Node images
Container-Optimized OS
Container-Optimized OS with containerd ( cos_containerd )
GKE Autopilot clusters
always use this image.
Ubuntu
Ubuntu with containerd ( ubuntu_containerd )
Windows Server
Windows Server LTSC with containerd ( windows_ltsc_containerd ) (Supports both LTSC2022 and LTSC2019 node images)
Container-Optimized OS
The Container-Optimized OS from Google node
images are based on a recent version of the Linux
kernel and
are optimized to enhance node security. Container-Optimized OS images are
backed by a team at Google that can quickly patch images for security and
iterate on features. The Container-Optimized OS images provides better
support, security, and stability than other images.
Note: For GKE nodes, the Container-Optimized OS
automatic update feature is
disabled. GKE has its own automatic
upgrade feature that can be
used instead.
For information about the image project and family, see
Node image source projects .
Container-Optimized OS variants
You can use the following Container-Optimized OS image:
Container-Optimized OS with containerd ( cos_containerd ) : The
cos_containerd image uses containerd as the container runtime directly
integrated with Kubernetes. GKE Autopilot clusters
always use this image. For more information, see Containerd node
images .
Ubuntu
The Ubuntu node images has been validated against GKE's node
image requirements. You should use the Ubuntu node images if your nodes require
support for XFS, CephFS, or Debian packages.
For information about the image project and family, see Feature support by
operating system .
Note: You may need to use solutions like Automatically bootstrap GKE nodes with
DaemonSets
to customize the Ubuntu features. Not all features supported by Ubuntu are
supported by GKE.
Ubuntu variants
You can use the following Ubuntu image:
Ubuntu with containerd ( ubuntu_containerd ) : The ubuntu_containerd
image uses containerd as the container runtime. For more information, see
Containerd node images .
Windows Server
When creating a cluster using Windows Server node
pools you can use a
Windows Server Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) node image. This Windows node
image is a Windows Server Datacenter Core image. A single cluster can have
multiple Windows Server node pools using different Windows Server versions, but
each individual node pool can only use one Windows Server version. For more
information, see Choose your Windows node
image .
You can use the following Windows Server image:
Windows Server LTSC with containerd ( windows_ltsc_containerd ) : The
windows_ltsc_containerd image uses containerd as the container runtime.
Currently, this image type maps to two node images: Windows Server 2022
and Windows Server 2019. You can create Windows LTSC2022 node pools
through the gcloud CLI command with flag windows-os-version .
For more information about creating Windows Server 2022 node pools, see
Create Windows Node
Pools
For more information about containerd node images, see Containerd node
images .
For information about the image project and family, see Feature support by
operating system .
Linux node image comparison
The following sections compare the operational aspects of the
Container-Optimized OS and Ubuntu node images, including:
Software package management
System initialization
Logs collection
File system layout
Storage driver support
Software package manager
The cos and cos_containerd node images use a minimal root file system with
built-in support for the Docker (containerd) container runtime, which also
serves as the software package manager for installing software on the host. The
Ubuntu image uses the APT package
manager .
Managing software on Container-Optimized OS
The Container-Optimized OS image does not provide package management software
such as apt-get . You can't install arbitrary software onto the nodes using
conventional mechanisms. Instead, create a container image that contains the
software you need.
On Standard clusters for debugging purposes only,
Container-Optimized OS includes the
CoreOS Toolbox for installing
and running common debugging tools such as ping , psmisc , or pstree .
For more information about debugging Container-Optimized OS nodes, see the
Container-Optimized OS how-to guides .
Note: As a security measure, Autopilot clusters don't allow direct
access to nodes. If a node consistently has workload failures, you can
tell GKE about the problematic node .
Managing software on Ubuntu
The Ubuntu image uses the APT package manager. You can use the apt-get
command to install packages on these images. For example, to install ceph
packages:
sudo apt - get update
sudo apt - get install ceph
System initialization
Both the Container-Optimized OS and Ubuntu node image use systemd to manage
system resources and services during the system initialization process.
Both node images use
systemd service files
to define services on the node, and
systemd.targets
to group boot targets via dependencies.
Logs collection
The Container-Optimized OS and Ubuntu node images use systemd-journald
for collecting system-wide logs.
Viewing logs on Container-Optimized OS and Ubuntu
To view logs on a node with the Container-Optimized OS or Ubuntu node image, you
must use the journalctl
command. For example, to view containerd daemon logs:
sudo journalctl -u containerd
To view kubelet logs:
sudo journalctl -u kubelet
File system layout
The Ubuntu node image uses the standard Linux file system layout.
The Container-Optimized OS node image file system layout is optimized to enhance
node security. The boot disk space is split into three types of partitions:
Root partition , which is mounted as read-only
Stateful partitions , which are writable and stateful
Stateless partitions , which are writable but the contents do not persist across reboots
When using Container-Optimized OS, be aware of the partitioning if you run your
own services that have certain expectations about the filesystem layout outside
of containers.
Working with the Container-Optimized OS file system
The following is a list of paths in the Container-Optimized OS node image file
system, along with their properties and recommended usage:
Path
Properties
Purpose
/
read-only
executable
The root filesystem is mounted as read-only to maintain integrity. The
kernel verifies integrity root filesystem during boot up, and refuses to boot
in case of errors.
/home
/var
writable
non-executable
stateful
These paths are meant for storing data that persists for the lifetime of
the boot disk. They are mounted from /mnt/stateful_partition .
/var/lib/google
/var/lib/docker
/var/lib/toolbox
writable
executable
stateful
These paths are working directories for Compute Engine packages (for example, the
accounts manager service), Docker, and Toolbox
respectively.
/var/lib/cloud
writable
executable
stateless
tmpfs
This path is the working directory of the cloud-init package.
/etc
writable
executable
stateless
tmpfs
Typically holds your configuration (for example,
systemd services defined via cloud-init ).
It's a good idea to capture the desired state of your instances in
cloud-init , as cloud-init is applied when an
instance is newly created as well as when an instance is
restarted.
/tmp
writable
non-executable
stateless
tmpfs
Typically used as a scratch space and should not be used to store
persistent data.
/mnt/disks
writable
executable
stateless
tmpfs
You can mount persistent disks at directories under /mnt/disks .
Storage driver support
Each node image differs in the kinds of storage plugins it supports. The
following terms apply when describing a node image's support for a particular
storage driver:
Yes - Fully Tested/Supported : This storage plugin is fully supported and
tested with the specified node image.
Yes - Limited Testing : This storage plugin works with the
specified node image, but have been tested only in a limited fashion; you
might encounter unexpected behavior. For Container-Optimized OS, these plugins
will eventually be fully tested and supported.
Unsupported : This storage plugin has not been tested or used with the
specified node image and GKE cannot provide any guarantee
of functionality. There are no plans to test this storage plugin.
No : This storage plugin does not work with the specified
node image due to a limitation inherent to the node OS or Google Cloud.
The following matrix describes how each GKE node image
supports some common storage plugins.
Volume Type
Does it work on Container-Optimized OS ( cos )?
Does it work on Ubuntu?
Compute Engine Persistent Disk (EXT4 or XFS)
Yes - Fully Tested/Supported (XFS is supported in cos-85 and later only.) See
the GKE release notes
Yes - Fully Tested/Supported
NFSv3
Yes - Fully Tested/Supported
Yes - Fully Tested/Supported
NFSv4

Yes - Fully Tested/Supported
CephFS
No
Yes - Limited Testing (Driver is not installed by default. You must install the ceph client, preferably via DaemonSet .)
Cinder
No
No
Fibre Channel
No
No
Flocker
Unsupported
Unsupported
iSCSI
No
No
RBD
No
No
Note: Consider using Container Storage Interface (Beta)
to add support for volume plugins on your cluster instead of depending on
pre-installed OS packages.
Time synchronization
Both Container-Optimized OS and Ubuntu node images use an internal network
time protocol (NTP) server as the primary source of time. This internal NTP
server is smeared identically to
Google Public NTP .
If the internal NTP server is unavailable, both Container-Optimized OS and
Ubuntu node images use the real-time clock (RTC) , which is the hardware clock
of the host machine, as a backup source of time.
Random number generation
In both Container-Optimized OS and Ubuntu nodes, Pods have access to the
/dev/random and /dev/urandom files .
These files provide random numbers that are supplied by
Virtio RNG
from an entropy pool that's generated by the Compute Engine instance.
Node VM modifications
Modifications on the boot disk of a node VM do not persist across node
re-creations. Nodes are re-created during manual upgrade ,
auto-upgrade ,
auto-repair , and
auto-scaling . In addition,
nodes are re-created when you enable a feature that requires node re-creation,
such as GKE Sandbox ,
intranode visibility , and
shielded nodes .
To preserve modifications across node re-creation, use a DaemonSet .
It's not recommended to manage critical software provided by a node image, such
as the kernel or container runtime. Node images are tested extensively, and
modifying critical software provided in the node image puts the node into an
unknown and untestable state. GKE Autopilot nodes don't
allow node software modification.
Map Container-Optimized OS node image versions to GKE patch versions
GKE publishes a JSON mapping of GKE patch versions
to Container-Optimized OS node image versions:
Mapping of GKE patch versions to
Container-Optimized OS node
images
You can use this mapping to upgrade to a specific version of GKE
to get a specific image version. For example, if your cluster needs a certain
feature or fix from an image version, you can find the mapping, and upgrade your
cluster to a specific GKE version to get the
Container-Optimized OS image version with the changes. For details on
Container-Optimized OS image releases, see the
Container-Optimized OS release
notes .
This list is updated weekly, approximately. To see the freshness of the
information, refer to the creation_time field in the JSON file.
