Autopilot
You can control which privileged workloads can run in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
Autopilot mode by using allowlists and policies. This document
describes the default constraints that Autopilot enforces on workloads,
the types of privileged workloads that you can run in Autopilot
mode, and the methods of controlling privileged workload admission.
This document is for the following people:
Platform admins and operators who want to run privileged GKE
workloads from various sources in Autopilot mode.
Identity and account admins who want to improve the security posture of your
organization by blocking all privileged workloads except for specific
workloads.
About privileged workloads in Autopilot mode
To improve your security posture, Autopilot mode clusters and nodes
enforce specific
security constraints by
default. For example, Autopilot rejects most Pods that set the
spec.securityContext.privileged field to true in a container. Privileged
workloads in Autopilot are workloads that don't meet these default
constraints. By default, Autopilot nodes in a Google Cloud
organization reject privileged workloads.
Specific privileged workloads can run in Autopilot mode only if the
cluster has allowlists that match those workloads. When a cluster admin
creates or modifies a cluster, they can specify paths to allowlists that the
cluster can run. By default, every Google Cloud organization supports
allowlists from Autopilot partners and verified open source projects.
Organization administrators can modify this default behavior in the following
ways by using
Organization Policy Service :
Allow all workloads from
GKE Autopilot partners
and verified open source workloads. This is the default behavior in all
Google Cloud organizations.
Allow specific partner workloads or verified open source workloads.
Allow only specific customer-owned privileged workloads.
Deny all privileged workloads.
This deny all, and then allow some approach is a security best practice that
lets you control exactly what runs with elevated privileges in your
GKE clusters.
You might want to control privileged workloads in Autopilot mode in
situations like the following:
You
run workloads in Autopilot mode in Standard clusters and you want privileged workloads to
run on those nodes.
You want to allow only a specific set of privileged workloads to run in your
organization, folder, or project.
Sources of privileged Autopilot workloads
The following table describes the types of privileged workloads that you can
run in Autopilot:
Privileged workload types
Autopilot partner workloads
A subset of Google Cloud partners provide privileged workloads
for Autopilot mode. GKE verifies these partner
workloads. These workloads are available to any customer. By default, any
customer can install the corresponding allowlists in any
Autopilot or Standard cluster.
For more information about the available partner workloads, see
Autopilot partners .
Open source workloads
Specific privileged open source workloads have allowlists that let
you run those workloads in Autopilot mode. GKE
verifies these workloads. By default, any customer can install the
corresponding allowlists in any Autopilot or Standard
cluster.
For more information about the available open source workloads, see
Run privileged open source workloads on GKE Autopilot .
Customer-owned workloads
If you're an eligible customer who has privileged workloads that you
want to run in Autopilot nodes, you can create allowlists for
those workloads. This capability is disabled by default for all
Google Cloud organizations. You use Organization Policy Service to add allowlist
paths for specific workloads, and then update clusters to install those
allowlists.
Note : Running your own privileged workloads in
Autopilot is available only to eligible Google Cloud
customers. To check whether you're eligible, contact
Cloud Customer Care .
For more information, see the
Customer-owned privileged workloads
section.
How privileged workload admission control works
To allow specific privileged workloads to run in your Autopilot
nodes, you install allowlists that correspond to each workload. These
allowlists are WorkloadAllowlist Kubernetes custom resources.
GKE validates the workload details against any WorkloadAllowlists
in the cluster, and allows admission only if the details match. By default,
every Autopilot or Standard cluster in a Google Cloud
organization lets you install WorkloadAllowlists for Autopilot partner
workloads and for open source workloads.
At a high level, running privileged workloads in Autopilot nodes
involves these steps:
The organization administrator verifies that the
container.managed.autopilotPrivilegedAdmission managed
Organization Policy constraint allows the installation of allowlists from
a specific source. For more information, see the
Organization Policy managed constraint for allowlists
section.
For customer-owned privileged workloads, the platform administrator creates
allowlists that match the privileged workloads. For more information, see
the
Customer-owned privileged workloads
section.
The cluster admin configures an Autopilot or Standard
cluster to allow installation of allowlists from a specific source. For more
information, see the Cluster configuration
section.
The cluster admin creates an AllowlistSynchronizer that references the path
to the allowlist. The AllowlistSynchronizer installs the allowlist and keeps
the allowlist up to date. For more information, see the
Allowlist installation section.
After these steps are completed, an app operator can deploy the privileged
workload in the cluster.
Organization Policy managed constraint for allowlists
By default, every Google Cloud organization enforces an organization
policy that's based on the
container.managed.autopilotPrivilegedAdmission
managed constraint .
This constraint defines a set of file or directory paths from which
GKE clusters can install allowlists. The cluster configuration
must use allowlist paths from the parameters of this constraint.
By default, the autopilotPrivilegedAdmission constraint allows the use of
all allowlists that are owned by approved GKE partners and open
source projects. This setting matches the default configuration of
GKE clusters, which can install any of those approved allowlists.
As an organization policy administrator, you can modify the set of allowlist
paths that can be applied to GKE clusters in your organization,
folder, or project. For example, to allow the use of a custom allowlist that
your organization owns, you add that allowlist path to the managed constraint.
Managed constraint parameters
The autopilotPrivilegedAdmission managed constraint has the following
specification:
spec :
rules :
- enforce : true
parameters :
allowAnyGKEPath : ALLOW_GKE_PATHS
allowPaths :
- PATH1
- PATH2
- PATH3
The following fields in the specification control the set of allowlists that
clusters can use:
allowAnyGKEPath : a boolean value that controls whether clusters can use the
default set of GKE-approved allowlist paths. This parameter
supports the following values:
True : cluster admins can configure clusters without modifying the
allowlist configuration, with one or more allowlist paths that start with
gke:// , or with an empty string to disable all allowlists for the cluster.
True is the default value for this parameter.
False : cluster admins must configure clusters with an empty string
for allowlist sources or with any allowlist paths from the allowPaths
parameter.
Caution: If you set the allowAnyGKEPath parameter to False , cluster
creation or modification requests must explicitly set the cluster allowlist
configuration to an empty string or to one or more paths from the
allowPaths parameter of this constraint. All Autopilot and
Standard clusters in the organization, folder, or project are
affected.
allowPaths : a list of approved allowlist sources that cluster admins can
specify values from when they configure a cluster. You can specify paths to
specific allowlist files or to entire directories.
The following table describes the results of configuring these parameters in
different ways:
allowAnyGKEPath value
allowPaths value
Result
True
Empty or unspecified.
Cluster admins can do any of the following actions during cluster
creation or modification:
Use the default allowlist configuration : omit any allowlist
configuration options, so that the cluster can install allowlists from
any path that has the gke:// prefix.
Disable allowlist installation : specify an empty value for
the cluster allowlist configuration.
Specify GKE allowlist paths : specify one or more
allowlist paths that have the gke:// prefix. The cluster
can install allowlists only from those paths.
False
Empty or unspecified.
Cluster admins must specify an empty value for the cluster allowlist
configuration. If cluster admins skip allowlist path configuration, then
cluster creation or modification fails.
Caution : This configuration requires all
clusters to disable all allowlists, including allowlists for partner
workloads. Before you specify this configuration, verify that your
clusters don't depend on those workloads.
True
Values are specified.
Cluster admins can do any of the following actions during cluster
creation or modification:
Use the default allowlist configuration :omit any allowlist
configuration options, so that the cluster can install allowlists from
any path that has the gke:// prefix.
Disable allowlist installation : specify an empty value for
the cluster allowlist configuration.
Specify allowlist paths : specify one or more allowlist paths
that have either the gke:// prefix or are specified in the
allowPaths parameter.
False
Values are specified.
Cluster admins must do one of the following actions during cluster
creation or modification:
Disable allowlist installation : specify an empty value for
the cluster allowlist configuration.
Specify allowlist paths : specify one or more allowlist paths
from the allowPaths parameter.
Caution : This configuration requires that
clusters disable allowlists for partner workloads. Before you specify this
configuration, verify that your clusters don't depend on those partner
workloads.

organization policies, see
Restrict privileged GKE workloads in organizations .
Customer-owned privileged workloads
Note: Running your own privileged workloads in Autopilot is available
only to eligible Google Cloud customers. To request access to this
feature, contact Cloud Customer Care .
As a GKE customer, you might have your own specialized workloads
that require more privileges in the cluster than the default Autopilot
security constraints allow. In GKE version
1.35 and later, you can exempt these
workloads from the default Autopilot constraints by creating
allowlists.
An allowlist is a YAML file that defines a WorkloadAllowlist Kubernetes
custom resource. The specification of a WorkloadAllowlist matches various fields
in the Kubernetes Pod specification. When you define a WorkloadAllowlist, you
match the values in the WorkloadAllowlist to corresponding fields in the
specification of your privileged workload. You store the YAML files in a
Cloud Storage bucket.
To install these customer-owned allowlists in a cluster, the following steps
must happen:
Your organization administrator adds the Cloud Storage paths to an
organization policy. For more information, see the
About the Organization Policy managed constraint
section.
You add the Cloud Storage paths to a cluster configuration. For
more information, see the
Cluster configuration section.
For more information about creating your own WorkloadAllowlists, see
Create allowlists for privileged Autopilot workloads .
Cluster configuration
To run a privileged workload in Autopilot mode, a cluster admin
adds one or more approved allowlist paths to the cluster configuration. After
you add the paths to the cluster, app operators can install the corresponding
allowlists and privileged workloads in the cluster.
By default, you can install allowlists from Autopilot partners and
approved open source projects. This default set of approved sources for
allowlists might change because of an organization policy, as described in the
preceding section. If an organization policy controls the approved allowlist
paths, you must coordinate with your organization administrator to identify
those paths. You can then specify one or more of the approved paths in the
cluster configuration.
For more information about configuring clusters, see
Run privileged workloads in Autopilot .
Allowlist installation
To install an allowlist from an approved source in your cluster, you use a
Kubernetes custom resource named the AllowlistSynchronizer. You define and
create AllowlistSynchronizers similarly to how you create other Kubernetes
resources like Pods and Deployments. Each AllowlistSynchronizer has
a list of paths to allowlists that you want to install in the cluster.
When you create an AllowlistSynchronizer, GKE installs allowlists
from these paths and keeps the allowlists up-to-date. Every 10 minutes,
GKE checks for changes to allowlist files. If an update exists,
the synchronizer installs the updated allowlist in the cluster.
After GKE installs an allowlist based on an AllowlistSynchronizer,
you can create the corresponding privileged workload in the cluster.
For more information about installing allowlists in a cluster, see
Run privileged workloads in Autopilot .
Allowlist paths
When you configure allowlist support in your organization policy or clusters,
you specify paths to one or more WorkloadAllowlists that you've approved for
installation. The syntax for these paths depends on who created the
WorkloadAllowlist, as follows:
Specific Autopilot partners and approved open source projects:
gke:// REPOSITORY_PATH / SELECTOR
Replace the following:
REPOSITORY_PATH : the path to the directory that
contains allowlists for the workload, such as Grafana/alloy . For more
information about the allowlist paths for these workloads, see the following
pages:
Autopilot partner workloads
Privileged open source workloads with Autopilot support
SELECTOR : the name of a specific file or the *
character, which selects every file in that directory.
For example, the following path selects any allowlist in the Grafana/alloy
directory:
gke://Grafana/alloy/*
Customer-owned privileged workloads :
gs:// DIRECTORY_PATH / SELECTOR
Replace DIRECTORY_PATH with the path to the directory
in Cloud Storage that contains your allowlist files. You can specify
multiple paths.
You can specify one or more of the preceding paths in your organization policy
or cluster configuration. For example, you can add GKE partner
workloads and customer-owned workloads to the same configuration. You can also
use the * character to select all allowlists. For example, gke://* selects
any GKE-approved allowlist from any source.
The following table describes the configuration that's needed in organization
policies or clusters to support certain objectives:
Objective
Organization policy configuration
Cluster configuration
Allow all GKE-approved WorkloadAllowlists
Do the following:
Set the allowAnyGKEPath parameter to the default value of
True .
Keep the allowPaths parameter empty.

Don't configure allowlists for your cluster. By default, all
clusters allow the installation of GKE-approved WorkloadAllowlists.
Specify only gke://* as the approved path when you
configure allowlists for your cluster.
Allow only specific GKE-approved WorkloadAllowlists
Do the following:
Set the allowAnyGKEPath parameter to False .
Specify paths to specific GKE-approved
WorkloadAllowlists in the allowPaths parameter.
Specify paths to specific GKE-approved
WorkloadAllowlists when you create or update a cluster. An organization
policy might restrict which GKE-approved paths you can
specify.

Do the following:
Set the allowAnyGKEPath parameter to False .
Specify paths to customer-managed WorkloadAllowlists in the
allowPaths parameter.
Specify paths to customer-managed WorkloadAllowlists when you create
or update a cluster. The paths that you specify must be in the
allowPaths parameter of an organization policy.
Prevent the use of WorkloadAllowlists
Do the following:
Set the allowAnyGKEPath parameter to False .
Keep the allowPaths parameter empty.
Set an empty string "" as the approved path when you
create or update a cluster.
