This document introduces the concept of cluster disruption budgets , and
explains how you can optionally customize them to fit your environment's needs.
Cluster disruption budgets are one tool in a suite of features which empower a
platform administrator to minimize disruption to workloads while enhancing their
performance, reliability, and security.
Cluster upgrades—which are when GKE updates the version used by
your cluster's control plane and nodes—can be a primary source of disruption
for a GKE cluster. For more information about what upgrades are,
see About GKE cluster upgrades . To
learn about all of the other features for minimizing disruption during cluster
upgrades, see that document's Control cluster
upgrades section. For more
general information about cluster lifecycle changes beyond cluster upgrades, see
Manage cluster lifecycle changes to minimize
disruption .
What is a cluster disruption budget
To help ensure that your cluster isn't disrupted by automatic upgrades too
frequently, GKE, by default, applies a cluster disruption
budget to set a minimum interval between automatic cluster control plane
upgrades . GKE
also applies this budget between cluster creation and the first automatic
control plane upgrade. Also, if you manually upgrade the cluster control plane,
GKE respects the cluster disruption budget when performing the
next automatic upgrade. You can always manually upgrade the cluster, even if
this upgrade violates the cluster disruption budget.
In a cluster, GKE automatically upgrades the control plane before
the nodes. So, this budget also sets the minimum cadence of automatic cluster
node upgrades .
GKE has default cluster disruption budgets for different types
of version upgrades :
Patch version upgrades : 24 hours
Minor version upgrades : 30 days
GKE applies the budget between the same types of upgrades. For
example, GKE waits 24 hours between upgrading a cluster between
the patch versions 1.35.0-gke.1403000 and 1.35.0-gke.1624000, and 30 days
between 1.34 and 1.35. However, GKE waits 24 hours after a minor
upgrade before performing a patch upgrade.
GKE uses a cluster disruption budget only for cluster upgrades,
and not for other types of changes to a GKE
cluster .
The cluster disruption budget is distinct from, but can pair well with,
maintenance windows and
exclusions .
Maintenance policies control when GKE cluster maintenance can and
can't happen, whereas the cluster disruption budget sets a specific interval of
time between cluster upgrades.
When to customize your cluster's disruption budget
GKE's default cluster disruption budgets reflect a balance
between timeliness of upgrades, while also avoiding back-to-back upgrades and
optimizing for stability. However, these general values might not be ideal for
your cluster environment.
If you want to control this minimum amount of time between automatic cluster
upgrades, you can configure the cluster disruption budget. Consider, for
example, the following scenarios:
You have a custom process for evaluating a GKE control plane
patch version before pushing the version to production, and this process
takes a specific amount of time greater than the default cluster budget.
You have large clusters which take a longer amount of time to upgrade all of
the node pools. You want to maintain relative consistency of versions across
these node pools. So, you lower the frequency of patch upgrades, upgrading
monthly, while allowing frequent maintenance windows to help ensure that
node pool upgrades complete in a timely manner.
Set the cluster disruption budget for automatic upgrades
If you have a specific need for controlling the interval between two minor
upgrades or two patch upgrades, you can set your own cluster disruption budgets.
First, however, we recommend that you start by configuring a maintenance
window
to set a recurring time for GKE cluster maintenance. Then, you
can optionally customize the interval between upgrades with the cluster
disruption budget.
We recommend that you use the cluster disruption budget along with the other
available tools GKE offers to control cluster
upgrades . These settings,
which work with all other upgrade tools, affect only the timing of when
GKE auto-upgrades a cluster to a new version. GKE
still adheres to maintenance windows and exclusions, follows the order of a
rollout sequence, and applies any other standard practices that are typically
used for automatic upgrades.
The default cluster disruption budget is 24 hours for patch upgrades, and 30
days for minor upgrades. You can configure the intervals for any amount of time
between 0 and 90 days. However, you should be aware of the following
considerations when updating these values:
We recommend that you don't set the patch upgrades interval for greater than
30 days, unless you have a specific version qualification process which
takes longer than this. You might miss critical patches if you upgrade with
less frequency than 30 days.
We recommend that you allow for minor upgrades as frequently as is
acceptable for your cluster environment. If you set the minor upgrades
interval for the maximum of 90 days, you increase the chance that
GKE must upgrade your cluster from the minor version when it
reaches the end of support. GKE adheres to a separate cluster
disruption budget for minor upgrades of 7 days when a minor version reaches
the end of support, and doesn't adhere to any cluster disruption budget that
you configured. For more information, see Automatic upgrades at the end of
support .
We recommend that you set the patch upgrades interval for a shorter period
of time than the minor upgrades interval.
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure that you have performed the following tasks:
Enable
the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
Enable Google Kubernetes Engine API
If you want to use the Google Cloud CLI for this task,
install and then
initialize the
gcloud CLI. If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest
version by running the gcloud components update command. Earlier gcloud CLI versions might not support running the commands in this document.
Note: For existing gcloud CLI
installations, make sure to set the compute/region property . If you use primarily zonal clusters, set the compute/zone instead. By setting a default location,
you can avoid errors in the gcloud CLI like the following:
One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location . You might need to specify the location in certain commands if the location of your cluster differs from the default that you set.
Configure the cluster disruption budget
First, if you haven't already done so, we recommend that you configure a
maintenance
window .
Then, to set a custom cluster disruption budget, use the following flags when
you create or update a cluster using the gcloud CLI:
Minor upgrades :
--maintenance-minor-version-disruption-interval= MINOR_INTERVAL
Patch upgrades :
--maintenance-patch-version-disruption-interval= PATCH_INTERVAL
For these flags, replace MINOR_INTERVAL or
PATCH_INTERVAL , respectively, with a duration expressed
in seconds between 0 days ( 0s ) and 90 days ( 7776000s ).
You can use these flags in the following situations:
Create a cluster :
Autopilot : gcloud container clusters
create-auto
Standard : gcloud container cluster
create
Update a cluster : gcloud container cluster
update
You can use the flags at the same time or independently.
Reset the cluster disruption budget to the default values
To reset the cluster disruption budget to the default values of 24 hours for
patch upgrades and 30 days for minor upgrades, you can use the following flags:
Minor upgrades : --clear-maintenance-minor-version-disruption-interval
Patch upgrades : --clear-maintenance-patch-version-disruption-interval
Use these flags when you update a cluster with the gcloud container cluster
update command.
You can use the flags at the same time or independently.
