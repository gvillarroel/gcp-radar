This document provides best practices for improving the security of your
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) environments. Security specialists who define,
govern, and implement policies and procedures can use these best practices to
protect their organization's data.
You should already be familiar with the following:
General overview of GKE security
GKE cluster architecture
New GKE clusters implement many of the best practices in this
document by default. Autopilot mode clusters have a stricter default
security posture than Standard mode clusters.
To implement and enforce the best practices in this document across your
organization, consider the following services:
Security Command Center :
automatically check whether your clusters implement many of these best
practices and check for other common misconfigurations.
Organization Policy Service :
enforce specific best practices on GKE resource in an
organization, folder, or project. Specific sections in this document have
links to the Google Cloud console for you to apply
managed constraints
for those recommendations.
Google Cloud environment design
The following sections describe security measures that you should consider when
you plan and design your resources in Google Cloud.
Cloud architects should use these recommendations when planning and
defining Google Cloud architecture.
Best practices
Plan your Google Cloud resource structure
Plan multi-tenant environments
Use Tags to group Google Cloud resources
Plan your VPC networks
Design an incident response plan
Plan your Google Cloud resource structure
Recommended : implement the
enterprise foundations blueprint ,
which is a complete foundation for your enterprise environment based on our best
practices.
The architecture of your Google Cloud organizations, folders, and
projects affects your security posture. Design these foundational resources in
a way that enables governance and security controls at scale across your
services.
Plan multi-tenant environments
Recommended : implement Google Cloud and GKE best
practices for multi-tenant enterprise platforms.
Many GKE customers manage distributed teams, with separate
engineering workflows and responsibilities. These multi-tenant environments
must have shared infrastructure that all of your developers can use, while
restricting access to components based on roles and responsibilities. The
enterprise application blueprint builds on the
enterprise foundations blueprint
to help you to deploy internal developer platforms in multi-tenant environments.
For more information, see the following documents:
Deploy an enterprise developer platform on Google Cloud
Best practices for enterprise multi-tenancy
Use tags to group Google Cloud resources
Recommended : use tags to organize GKE resources for
conditional policy enforcement and improved accountability across your teams.
Tags are metadata that you can attach to resources in your organizations,
folders, and projects to identify business dimensions across your
Google Cloud resource hierarchy. You can attach tags to GKE
clusters and node pools, and then use those tags to conditionally apply
organization policies, IAM policies, or firewall policies.
For more information, see the following documents:
Tags overview
Manage GKE resources using Tags
Plan your VPC networks
Recommended : implement Google Cloud and GKE best
practices for VPC network design.
Your VPC network design and the features that you use impact
your network security. Plan your networks based on your Google Cloud
resource hierarchy and your security objectives. For more information, see the
following documents:
Best practices and reference architectures for VPC design
Best practices for GKE networking
Design an incident response plan
Recommended : create and maintain an incident response plan that meets your
security and reliability goals.
Security incidents can occur even when you implement every possible security
control. An incident response plan helps you to identify potential gaps in your
security controls, respond quickly and effectively to various types of incidents,
and reduce downtime during an outage. For more information, see the following
documents:
Mitigate security incidents
Well-Architected Framework: Security, privacy, and compliance pillar
Google Cloud network security
The following sections provide security recommendations for your
VPC networks. Network architects and
network administrators should apply these recommendations to reduce the
attack surface at the network level and to limit the impact of unintended
network access.
Best practices
Use least-privilege firewall rules
Use Shared VPC for cross-project traffic
Use separate networks to isolate environments
Use least-privilege firewall rules
Recommended : when you create firewall rules, use the principle of least
privilege to provide access only for the required purpose. Ensure that your
firewall rules don't conflict with, or override, the GKE default
firewall rules when possible.
GKE creates
default VPC firewall rules
to enable system functionality and to enforce good security practices. If you
create permissive firewall rules with a higher priority than a default firewall
rule (for example, a firewall rule that allows all ingress traffic for debugging),
your cluster is at risk of unintended access.
Use Shared VPC for cross-project traffic
Recommended : use Shared VPC to let resources in multiple projects
communicate with each other by using internal IP addresses.
Resources in different projects in your organization might need to communicate
with each other. For example, frontend services in a GKE cluster
in one project might need to communicate with backend Compute Engine
instances in a different project.
For more information, see the following documents:
Shared VPC overview
Configure clusters with Shared VPC
Use separate networks to isolate environments
Recommended : use separate Shared VPC networks for staging, test, and
production environments.
Isolate your development environments from each other to reduce the impact and
risk of unauthorized access or disruptive bugs. For more information,
see
Multiple host projects .
Immutable security settings
The following sections provide security recommendations that you can configure
only when you create clusters or node pools. You can't update existing clusters
or node pools to change these settings. Platform admins should apply these
recommendations to new clusters and node pools.
Use least-privilege IAM node service accounts
Recommended : use a custom IAM service account for your
GKE clusters and node pools instead of using the default
Compute Engine service account.
GKE uses IAM service accounts that are attached to your nodes to
run system tasks like logging and monitoring. At a minimum, these node service accounts
must have the
Kubernetes Engine Default Node Service Account
( roles/container.defaultNodeServiceAccount ) role on your project. By default,
GKE uses the
Compute Engine default service account ,
which is automatically created in your project, as the node service account.
If you use the Compute Engine default service account for other functions in your
project or organization, the service account might have more permissions than GKE
needs, which could expose you to security risks.
Best practice: Instead of using the Compute Engine default service account, create
a custom service account for your nodes to use and give it only the permissions that
GKE needs to run system tasks.
For
more information, see
Configure a custom node service account .
The service account that's attached to your nodes should be used only by system workloads that
perform tasks like logging and monitoring. For your own workloads, provision identities using
Workload Identity Federation for GKE .
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.disallowDefaultComputeServiceAccount
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.
Go to Policy details
Use a Container-Optimized OS node image
Recommended : unless you have a specific requirement to use Ubuntu or
Windows, use the Container-Optimized OS node image for your nodes.
Container-Optimized OS is built, optimized, and hardened
specifically for running containers. Container-Optimized OS is the
only supported node image for Autopilot mode, and is the default node
image for Standard mode.
For more information, see the following documents:
Container-Optimized OS security overview
Containerd node images
Specify a node image
Node security configuration
The following sections provide security recommendations for GKE
node configuration. Platform admins and security engineers should apply
these recommendations to improve the integrity of your GKE nodes.
Best practices
Use Shielded GKE Nodes
Disable the insecure kubelet read-only port
Use Shielded GKE Nodes
Recommended : enable Shielded GKE Nodes, secure boot, and integrity
monitoring in all clusters and node pools.
Shielded GKE Nodes provides verifiable identity and integrity checks that
improve the security of your nodes. Shielded GKE Nodes and features like node
integrity monitoring and secure boot are always enabled in Autopilot
clusters. In Standard clusters, do the following:
Don't disable Shielded GKE Nodes in your clusters.
Enable secure boot in all of your node pools.
Don't disable integrity monitoring in your node pools.
For more information about how to enable these features, see
Using Shielded GKE Nodes .
Note: In Container-Optimized OS, secure boot doesn't change whether you
can load unsigned modules. If you want to change that setting for
Container-Optimized OS nodes,
Configure secure kernel module loading .
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.enableShieldedNodes
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.
Go to Policy details
Disable the insecure kubelet read-only port
Recommended : disable the kubelet read-only port and switch any workloads
that use port 10255 to use the more secure port 10250 instead.
The kubelet process running on nodes serves a read-only API using the insecure
port 10255 . Kubernetes doesn't perform any authentication or authorization
checks on this port. The kubelet serves the same endpoints on the more secure,
authenticated port 10250 .
For more information, see
Disable the kubelet read-only port in GKE clusters .
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.disableInsecureKubeletReadOnlyPort
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.
Go to Policy details
Access control
The following sections provide recommendations for restricting unauthorized
access in your cluster. Security engineers and identity and account admins
should apply these recommendations to reduce your attack surface and to limit
the impact of unauthorized access.
Best practices
Restrict access to cluster API discovery
Place teams and environments in separate namespaces or clusters
Use the principle of least privilege in access policies
Use Workload Identity Federation for GKE to access Google Cloud APIs
Use groups to manage access
Restrict anonymous access to cluster endpoints
Restrict access to cluster API discovery
Recommended : restrict access to your control plane and nodes from the
internet to prevent unintended access to cluster API discovery endpoints.
By default, Kubernetes creates clusters with a permissive set of
default API discovery roles .
These default roles give broad access to information about a cluster's APIs to
various default groups, such as system:authenticated . These default roles
don't represent a meaningful level of security for GKE clusters.
For example, the system:authenticated group, which can read information about
APIs like CustomResources, is assigned to any authenticated user (including
anyone with a Google account).
To restrict access to your cluster discovery APIs, do the following:
Restrict access to the control plane : use only the DNS-based endpoint
for control plane access. If you use IP-based endpoints, restrict access to
a set of known address ranges by configuring authorized networks.
Configure private nodes : disable the external IP addresses of your
nodes, so that clients outside of your network can't access the nodes.
For more information, see
About network isolation .
If you don't enable these network isolation features, treat all API discovery
information (especially the schema of CustomResources, APIService definitions,
and discovery information hosted by extension API servers) as publicly
disclosed.
Place teams and environments in separate namespaces or clusters
Give teams least-privilege access to Kubernetes by creating separate
namespaces or
clusters for each team and environment. For each namespace or cluster, assign
cost centers and labels for
accountability and chargeback .
You can use IAM and RBAC permissions together with namespaces to restrict user
interactions with cluster resources on Google Cloud console. For more information, see
Enable access and view cluster resources by namespace .
Use the principle of least privilege in access policies
Recommended : give developers only the access that they need to deploy and
manage applications in their namespace, especially in production environments.
When you design your access control policies, map out the tasks that your users
need to do in the cluster and give them only the permissions that allow them to
do those tasks.
In GKE, you can use IAM and Kubernetes role-based
access control (RBAC) to give permissions on resources. These access control
mechanisms work together. To reduce the complexity of managing access, do the
following:
To give access to your project or to Google Cloud resources, use
IAM roles .
To give access to Kubernetes resources in your cluster, such as namespaces,
use RBAC .
For more information about planning and designing IAM and RBAC
policies, see the following documents:
Use IAM securely
Best practices for GKE RBAC
Use Workload Identity Federation for GKE to access Google Cloud APIs
Recommended : to access Google Cloud resources from your
GKE workloads, use
Workload Identity Federation for GKE .
Workload Identity Federation for GKE is the recommended way to authenticate to
Google Cloud APIs. You can grant IAM roles on various
resources to principals in your cluster, such as specific Kubernetes
ServiceAccounts or Pods. Workload Identity Federation for GKE also protects sensitive metadata
on your nodes and provides a more secure authentication workflow than
alternatives like static token files.
Workload Identity Federation for GKE is always enabled in Autopilot clusters. In
Standard clusters, enable Workload Identity Federation for GKE for all clusters and
node pools. Additionally, follow these recommendations:
If you use Google Cloud client libraries in your application code,
then don't distribute Google Cloud credentials to your workloads. Code
that uses client libraries automatically retrieves credentials for
Workload Identity Federation for GKE.
Use a separate namespace and ServiceAccount for every workload that needs a
distinct identity. Grant IAM permissions to specific
ServiceAccounts.
For more information, see
Authenticate to Google Cloud APIs from GKE workloads .
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.enableWorkloadIdentityFederation
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.
Go to Policy details
Use groups to manage access
Recommended : in your access policies, give permissions to groups of users
instead of to individuals.
When you manage users in groups, your identity management system and identity
administrators can centrally control identities by modifying user membership in
various groups. This type of management negates the need to update your RBAC or
IAM policies every time that a specific user needs updated
permissions.
You can specify Google Groups in your IAM or RBAC policies.
For more information, see the following documents:
Configure Google Groups for RBAC
IAM principals
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.enableGoogleGroupsRBAC
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.
Go to Policy details
Restrict anonymous access to cluster endpoints
Recommended : prevent anonymous requests to all cluster endpoints except for
health check endpoints, in all Autopilot and Standard
clusters.
By default, Kubernetes assigns the system:anonymous user and the
system:unauthenticated group to
anonymous requests
to cluster endpoints. If your RBAC policies give this user or group additional
permissions, an anonymous user might be able to compromise the security of a
service or the cluster itself.
In GKE version 1.32.2-gke.1234000 and later, you can limit the
set of endpoints that anonymous requests can reach to only the /healthz ,
/livez , and /readyz Kubernetes API server health check endpoints.
Anonymous access to these health check endpoints is required to verify that a
cluster is operating correctly.
To limit anonymous access to cluster endpoints, specify LIMITED for the
--anonymous-authentication-config flag when you use the gcloud CLI
or the GKE API to create or update Standard and
Autopilot clusters. GKE rejects anonymous requests to
cluster endpoints that aren't the health check endpoints during authentication.
Anonymous requests don't reach the endpoints, even if your RBAC policies grant
access to anonymous users and groups. Rejected requests return an HTTP status of
401 .
In GKE version 1.35.0-gke.1171000 and later, anonymous access to
non-health-check endpoints is denied by default only on newly created clusters.
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, folder, or project by using
an organization policy, create a custom constraint with the
resource.anonymousAuthenticationConfig.mode condition. For more information
and for an example constraint, see
Restrict actions on GKE resources using custom organization policies .
Don't rely on this capability alone to secure your cluster. Implement additional
security measures like the following:
Network isolation
Avoid default roles and groups
GKE network security
The following sections provide recommendations to improve network security in
your clusters. Network administrators and security engineers should
apply these recommendations to protect workloads and infrastructure from
unintended external or internal access.
Best practices
Restrict access to the control plane
Isolate your nodes from the internet
Restrict network traffic among Pods
Restrict access to the control plane
Recommended : enable the DNS-based endpoint for control plane access and
disable all IP-based control plane endpoints.
By default, external entities, such as clients on the internet, can reach your
control plane. You can restrict who can access your control plane by configuring
network isolation .
To isolate your control plane, do one of the following:
Use only the DNS-based endpoint (recommended) : enable the DNS-based
endpoint for the control plane and disable internal and external IP-based
endpoints. All control plane access must use the DNS-based endpoint.
You can use VPC Service Controls to
control who can access the DNS-based endpoint.
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.enableControlPlaneDNSOnlyAccess
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.
Go to Policy details
Disable the external IP-based endpoint : remove the external IP address
of the control plane. Clients that are outside your VPC
network can't use the external IP address to access the control plane.
This option works well if you use technologies like
Cloud Interconnect
and Cloud VPN to
connect your company network to your VPC network.
Use authorized networks with the external IP-based endpoint : restrict
access to the external IP-based endpoint to only a trusted range of source
IP addresses.
This option works well if you don't have existing VPN infrastructure, or
if you have remote users or branch offices that access your clusters by
using the public internet.
In most scenarios, use only the DNS-based endpoint for control plane access. If
you have to enable the IP-based endpoint, use
authorized networks
to limit control plane access to the following entities:
The IP address ranges that you specify.
GKE nodes in the same VPC network as the
cluster.
Google-reserved IP addresses for cluster management purposes.
Isolate your nodes from the internet
By default, all GKE nodes have an external IP address that
clients on the internet can reach. To remove this external IP address,
enable private nodes .
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.enablePrivateNodes
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.
Go to Policy details
Restrict network traffic among Pods
Recommended : control Pod-to-Pod network traffic by using NetworkPolicies, a
service mesh, or both.
By default, every Pod in your cluster can communicate with every other Pod.
Restricting network access among services makes it much more difficult for
attackers to move laterally in your cluster. Your services also gain some
protection against accidental or deliberate denial-of-service incidents.
Depending on your requirements, use one or both of the following methods to
restrict Pod-to-Pod traffic:
Use Cloud Service Mesh
if you want features like load balancing, service authorization, throttling,
quota, and metrics. A service mesh is useful if you have large numbers of
distinct services that have complex interactions with each other.
Use Kubernetes NetworkPolicies
if you want a basic traffic flow control mechanism. To verify that your
NetworkPolicies work as expected, configure
network policy logging .
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.enableNetworkPolicy
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.
Go to Policy details
Sensitive data protection
The following sections provide recommendations for encrypting data and
protecting sensitive information like credentials. Security engineers and
platform admins should apply these recommendations to reduce the risk of
unintended access to critical data.
Best practices
Encrypt workload data in use
Store secrets outside of your cluster
Encrypt workload data in use
Use hardware-based memory encryption to protect data that's in use by your
workloads by using Confidential GKE Nodes. You can choose a
Confidential Computing technology based on your requirements. For more information,
see
Encrypt workload data in-use with Confidential GKE Nodes .
Store secrets outside of your cluster
Recommended : use an external secret manager like Secret Manager to
store sensitive data, such as API keys, outside of your cluster.
In Kubernetes, you can store sensitive data in Secrets in your cluster. You can
use Secrets to provide confidential data to applications without including that
data in the application code. However, storing this data in your cluster has
risks like the following:
Anyone who can create Pods in a namespace can read the data of any Secret in
that namespace.
Anyone with RBAC or IAM access to read all Kubernetes API
objects can read Secrets.
Because of these risks, create Secrets in your cluster only when you can't
provide that data to your workloads in any other way. We recommend the following
methods, in order of preference, to store and access your sensitive data:
Secret Manager client libraries :
programmatically access secrets from your application code by using the
Secret Manager API with Workload Identity Federation for GKE. For more information,
see
Access secrets stored outside GKE clusters using client libraries .
Secret Manager data as mounted volumes :
provide sensitive data to your Pods as mounted volumes by using the
Secret Manager add-on for GKE. This method is
useful if you can't modify your application code to use the
Secret Manager client libraries. For more information, see
Use Secret Manager add-on with Google Kubernetes Engine .
Third-party secret management tools : third-party tools like HashiCorp
Vault provide secret management capabilities for Kubernetes workloads. These
tools require more initial configuration than Secret Manager,
but are a more secure option than creating Secrets in the cluster. To
configure a third-party tool for secret management, see the provider's
documentation. Additionally, consider the following recommendations:
If the third-party tool runs in a cluster, use a different cluster than the
cluster that runs your workloads.
Use Cloud Storage or Spanner to store the tool's
data.
Use an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer to expose the third-party secret management tool to
Pods that run in your VPC network.
Use Kubernetes Secrets (not recommended) : if none of the preceding options
is suitable for your use case, you can store the data as Kubernetes Secrets.
Google Cloud
encrypts data at the storage layer by default .
This default storage-layer encryption includes the database that stores the
state of your cluster, which is based on either etcd or Spanner.
Additionally, you can encrypt these Secrets at the application-layer with a
key that you manage. For more information, see
Encrypt secrets at the application layer .
Workload security
The following sections provide recommendations for improving the security of
your cluster against workload issues. Security engineers and platform admins
should apply these recommendations to improve the protection of
GKE infrastructure from workloads.
Best practices
Isolate workloads by using GKE Sandbox
Restrict workload access by using RBAC
Isolate workloads by using GKE Sandbox
Recommended : use
GKE Sandbox to prevent
malicious code from affecting the host kernel on your cluster nodes.
You can run containers in a sandboxed environment to mitigate against most
container escape attacks, also called local privilege escalation attacks. As
described in
GKE security bulletins ,
this type of attack lets an attacker gain access to the host VM of the
container. The attacker can use this host access to access other containers on
the same VM. GKE Sandbox
can help to limit the impact of these attacks.
Use GKE Sandbox in scenarios like the following:
You have workloads that run untrusted code.
You want to limit the impact if an attacker compromises a container in the
workload.
For more information, see
Harden workload isolation with GKE Sandbox .
Restrict workload access by using RBAC
Recommended : design and implement good RBAC policies to reduce the risk of
unauthorized access from workloads.
Kubernetes Pods use the identity provided by a ServiceAccount to perform various
actions, such as accessing resources in other namespaces or reading data in
Secrets. Use RBAC to restrict the permissions of ServiceAccounts based on the
requirements of the corresponding workloads. To reduce the risk of unauthorized
access from workloads, implement the
RBAC best practices .
Policy-based enforcement
The following sections provide recommendations for using policies to enforce
security constraints across multiple resources. Identity and account admins and
security engineers should apply these recommendations to maintain the
compliance of clusters and workloads with organizational security requirements.
Best practices
Enforce policies across the Google Cloud resource hierarchy
Enforce policies during workload admission
Enforce policies across the Google Cloud resource hierarchy
Recommended : to enforce security practices in your organization, folder, or
project, use
Organization Policy Service .
With Organization Policy, you can
centrally define constraints and enforce them at various levels of your resource
hierarchy. Various Google Cloud products publish
managed constraints
that let you apply best practice recommendations for that product. For example,
GKE publishes managed constraints for many of the best practices
in this document.
For more information about how to enable Organization Policy, see
Creating and managing organization policies .
Enforce policies during workload admission
Recommended : use an admission controller like Policy Controller or
the PodSecurity admission controller to review incoming API requests and enforce
policies on those requests.
Admission controllers
intercept authenticated, authorized requests to the Kubernetes API to perform
validation or mutation tasks before allowing a resource to persist in the API.
You can use the following methods for admission control in GKE
clusters:
Policy Controller :
control workload admission at scale across multiple GKE
clusters.
PodSecurity admission controller :
enforce the Kubernetes
Pod Security Standards
by applying predefined policies to entire clusters or to specific
namespaces.
Cluster management
The following sections provide recommendations for managing your clusters over
time, such as upgrading, monitoring, and configuring logs. Security engineers,
platform admins, and SREs should use these recommendations to maintain the
security posture of the GKE platform.
Best practices
Upgrade your GKE infrastructure regularly
Monitor your resources for security issues
Enable security bulletin notifications
Configure log collection
Upgrade your GKE infrastructure regularly
Recommended : keep your GKE version up to date to access new
security features and apply security patches. Use release channels, accelerated
patch auto-upgrades, and automatic node upgrades.
Kubernetes and GKE frequently release new patch versions that
include security improvements and vulnerability fixes. For all clusters,
GKE
automatically upgrades the control plane
to more stable minor versions and patch versions.
To ensure that your GKE cluster runs an up-to-date version, do
the following:
Enroll your clusters in a
release channel .
Autopilot clusters are always enrolled in a release channel.
For clusters that are in a release channel, enable
accelerated patch auto-upgrades
to get security patch versions as soon as they're available in your release
channel.
For Standard clusters that aren't in a release channel,
enable automatic node upgrades .
Node auto-upgrade is enabled by default for clusters created using the
Google Cloud console since June 2019, and for clusters created using
the GKE API starting on November 11, 2019.
If you use maintenance policies, use a
maintenance window
to let GKE auto-upgrade your nodes at least once a month.
For node pools that don't use node auto-upgrades, upgrade the node pools at
least once a month on your own schedule.
Track the
GKE security bulletins
and the
GKE release notes
for information about security patches.
Enable security bulletin notifications
Recommended : configure notifications for new security bulletins that affect
your cluster.
When security bulletins are available that are relevant to your cluster,
GKE publishes notifications about those events as messages to
Pub/Sub topics that you configure. You can receive these notifications
on a Pub/Sub subscription,
integrate with third-party services ,
and
receive notifications in Cloud Logging .
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.enableSecurityBulletinNotifications
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.
Go to Policy details
Configure log collection
Recommended : to reduce operational overhead and to maintain a consolidated
view of your logs, implement a consistent logging strategy across your clusters.
Don't disable log collection in your Standard clusters.
GKE clusters send specific
logs to Google Cloud Observability .
You can optionally configure the collection of additional types of logs.
In addition to system and workload logs, all GKE clusters send
the following audit logs to Logging:
Kubernetes audit logs : a chronological record of calls that have been
made to the Kubernetes API server. Kubernetes audit log entries are useful
for investigating suspicious API requests, for collecting statistics, or for
creating monitoring alerts for unwanted API calls.
GKE audit logs : a record of administrative and access
activities for the GKE API.
For more information, see the following documents:
About GKE logs
Google Kubernetes Engine audit logging
Kubernetes audit logging
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.enableCloudLogging
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.
Go to Policy details
Monitor your resources for security issues
Use the
GKE security posture dashboard
and
Security Command Center
to monitor your clusters and workloads for potential issues. You can use these
services to check for active vulnerabilities, threats, and security bulletins
that affect your GKE infrastructure.
Default security configurations
The following sections describe options that are configured by default in new
clusters to mitigate specific security concerns, like vulnerabilities or risks.
Security engineers and platform admins should validate that existing clusters
use these settings.
Best practices
Leave legacy client authentication methods disabled
Leave ABAC disabled
Leave the DenyServiceExternalIPs admission controller enabled
Leave legacy client authentication methods disabled
Recommended : disable legacy API server authentication methods like static
certificates and passwords.
There are several
methods of authenticating
to the Kubernetes API server. In GKE, the supported methods
are service account bearer tokens, OAuth tokens, and X.509 client certificates.
The gcloud CLI uses OAuth tokens to authenticate users for
GKE.
Legacy authentication methods like static passwords are disabled, because these
methods increase the attack surface for cluster compromises. In
Autopilot clusters, you can't enable or use these authentication
methods.
Use one of the following methods to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server:
Users : use the gcloud CLI to let GKE
authenticate users, generate OAuth access tokens for the cluster, and keep
the tokens up-to-date.
Applications : use Workload Identity Federation to let applications in
Google Cloud or in other environments authenticate to your cluster.
For more information about how to authenticate and how to disable legacy
authentication methods, see
Authenticate to the Kubernetes API server .
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.disableLegacyClientCertificateIssuance
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.

Leave ABAC disabled
Recommended : use IAM and RBAC to control access in
GKE. Don't enable attribute-based access control (ABAC).
ABAC is a legacy authorization method that's disabled by default in all
GKE clusters, and can't be enabled in Autopilot
clusters.
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.disableABAC
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.

Leave the DenyServiceExternalIPs admission controller enabled
Recommended : don't disable the
DenyServiceExternalIPs admission controller .
This admission controller blocks Services from using ExternalIPs and mitigates
GCP-2020-015 .
This admission controller is enabled by default in clusters that were created on
GKE version 1.21 and later. For cluster that were originally
created on an earlier GKE version, enable the admission
controller:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--no-enable-service-externalips
To enforce this recommendation in your organization, use the
constraints/container.managed.denyServiceExternalIPs
managed Organization Policy constraint .
To review this managed constraint in the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy details page.
