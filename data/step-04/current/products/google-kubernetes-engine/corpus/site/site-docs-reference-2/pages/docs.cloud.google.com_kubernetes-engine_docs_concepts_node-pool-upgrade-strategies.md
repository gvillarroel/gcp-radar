Autopilot
Standard
This document discusses the node upgrade strategies you can use with your
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters.
In GKE Standard clusters, you can configure one of the
following node upgrade strategies for each Standard node pool:
Surge upgrades : Nodes are upgraded in a rolling window. You can control
how many nodes can be upgraded at once and how disruptive upgrades are to the
workloads.
Blue-green upgrades : Existing nodes are kept available for
rolling back while the workloads are validated on the new node configuration.
Autoscaled blue-green upgrades
( Preview ):
Workloads can run for longer, while you minimize cost from idle or
underutilized nodes.
GKE chooses the following strategies for these specific
scenarios:
In Autopilot clusters, GKE uses surge upgrades. For
more information, see the Autopilot cluster upgrades document's
Surge
upgrades
section.
For Autopilot-managed node
pools in
Standard clusters, GKE uses surge upgrades. You
can't select a different strategy or change the configuration.
For nodes that use Flex-start VMs, GKE uses
short-lived upgrades .
Flex-start with queued provisioning supports new flags that are part of the
flex-start preview launch. Flex-start is powered
by Dynamic Workload Scheduler.
By choosing an upgrade strategy for your Standard node pool, you can
pick the process with the right balance of speed, workload disruption, risk
mitigation, and cost optimization. For more information about which node upgrade
strategy is right for your environment, see the following:
When to choose surge upgrades
When to choose blue-green
upgrades
When to choose autoscaled blue-green
upgrades
With each of these strategies, you can configure upgrade settings to optimize
the process based on your environment's needs. For more information, see
Configure your chosen upgrade
strategy . Ensure
that for the strategy that you pick, you have enough quota, resource
availability, or reservation capacity to upgrade your nodes using that strategy.
For more information, see Ensure resources for node
upgrades .
Note: Node upgrade strategies are used for any type of node configuration change
that requires the nodes to be recreated. For more information, see When
GKE uses surge upgrades , When
GKE uses blue-green
upgrades , and When GKE
uses autoscaled blue-green
upgrades .
Surge upgrades
Surge upgrades are the default upgrade strategy, and best for applications that
can handle incremental changes. Surge upgrades use a rolling method to upgrade
nodes, in an undefined order. Find the optimal balance of speed and disruption
for your environment by choosing how many new, surge nodes can be created, with
maxSurge , and how many existing nodes can be disrupted at once, with
maxUnavailable .
Surge upgrades also work with the cluster autoscaler to prevent changes to nodes
that are being upgraded.
When to choose surge upgrades for your environment
If cost optimization is important for you and your workload can tolerate being
shut down in less than 60 minutes, we recommend choosing surge upgrades for your
node pools.
Surge upgrades are optimal for the following scenarios:
if you want to optimize for the speed of upgrades.
if workloads are more tolerant of disruptions, where graceful termination up
to 60 minutes is acceptable.
if you want to control costs by minimizing the creation of new nodes.
When GKE uses surge upgrades
If enabled, GKE uses surge upgrades when the following types of
changes occur:
Version changes (upgrades)
Vertically scaling the nodes by changing the node machine attributes , including machine type, disk type, and disk size
Image type changes
IP rotation
Credential rotation
Network policy creation
Enabling image streaming
Network performance configuration updates
Enabling gVNIC
Node system configuration changes
Confidential nodes
Other changes, including applying updates to node labels and taints of existing
node pools , don't
use surge upgrades as they don't require recreating the nodes.
Understand surge upgrade settings
Use surge upgrade settings to select the appropriate balance between speed and
disruption for your node pool during cluster maintenance using the surge
settings. You can change how many nodes GKE attempts to upgrade
at once by
changing
the surge upgrade parameters on a Standard node pool.
Surge upgrade behavior is determined by the maxSurge and maxUnavailable
settings, which determine how many nodes are upgraded at the same time in a
rolling window with the described steps.
maxSurge : GKE creates a new surge node before removing an existing one
Set maxSurge to choose the maximum number of additional, surge nodes that can
be added to the node pool during an upgrade, per zone, increasing the likelihood
that workloads running on the existing node can migrate to a new node
immediately. The default is one. To upgrade one node, GKE does the
following steps:
Provision a new node.
Wait for the new node to be ready.
Cordon
the existing node.
Drain
the existing node, respecting
PodDisruptionBudget
and
GracefulTerminationPeriod
settings for up to one hour. After one hour, any remaining Pods are
forcefully evicted so that the upgrade can proceed.
Delete the existing node.
For GKE to create surge nodes, your project must have the
resources to temporarily create additional nodes. If you don't have additional
capacity, GKE won't start upgrading a node until the resources
are available. For more information, see Resources for surge
upgrades .
maxUnavailable : GKE makes an existing node unavailable to recreate it
Set maxUnavailable to choose the maximum number of nodes that can be
simultaneously unavailable during an upgrade, per zone. The default is zero.
Workloads running on the existing node might need to wait for the existing node
to upgrade, if no other nodes have capacity. To upgrade one node,
GKE does the following steps:
Cordon
the existing node.
Drain
the existing node, respecting
PodDisruptionBudget
and
GracefulTerminationPeriod
settings for up to one hour. After one hour, any remaining Pods are
forcefully evicted so that the upgrade can proceed.
Recreate the existing node with the new configuration.
Wait for the existing node to be ready.
Uncordon the existing, upgraded node.
When GKE recreates the existing node, GKE
temporarily releases the capacity of the node if the capacity isn't from a
reservation. This means that if there is limited capacity, you risk losing the
existing capacity. So, if your environment is resource-constrained, use this
setting only if you're using reserved nodes. For more information, see Upgrade
in a resource-constrained
environment .
Example use of maxSurge and maxUnavailable settings
For example, a GKE cluster has a single-zone node pool with 5
nodes and the following surge upgrade configuration:
maxSurge=2;maxUnavailable=1 .
During a surge upgrade with this node pool, in a rolling window,
GKE creates two upgraded nodes, and disrupts at most one existing
node at a time. GKE brings down at most three existing nodes
after the upgraded nodes are ready. During the upgrade process, the node pool
will include between four and seven nodes.
Considerations for surge upgrade settings
Consider the following information before configuring surge upgrade settings:
Nodes created by surge upgrade are subject to your Google Cloud
resource quotas , resource
availability , and
reservation
capacity , for node
pools with specific reservation
affinity .
If your environment is resource-constrained, see Upgrade in a
resource-constrained
environment .
The number of nodes that GKE upgrades simultaneously is the
sum of maxSurge and maxUnavailable . The maximum number of nodes upgraded
simultaneously is limited to 20. Surge upgrades also work with the cluster
autoscaler to prevent
changes to nodes that are being upgraded.
GKE upgrades multi-zone node
pools one zone
at a time. Surge upgrade parameters are applicable only up to the number of
nodes in the zone. The maximum number of nodes that can be upgraded in
parallel will be no higher than the sum of maxSurge plus maxUnavailable ,
and no higher than the number of nodes in the zone.
If your node pool uses Spot VMs, GKE creates surge
nodes with Spot VMs, but doesn't wait for Spot VMs to be
ready before cordoning and draining existing nodes. For more information,
see Upgrade Standard node pools using
Spot VMs .
Tune surge upgrade settings to balance speed and disruption
The following table describes four different upgrade profiles as examples to
help you understand different configurations:
Description
Configuration
Typical use case
Balanced (Default), slower but least disruptive
maxSurge=1 maxUnavailable=0
Most workloads
Fast, no surge resources, most disruptive
maxSurge=0 maxUnavailable=20
Large node pools after jobs have to run to completion
Fast, most surge resources and less disruptive
maxSurge=20 maxUnavailable=0
Large node pools
Slowest, disruptive, no surge resources
maxSurge=0 maxUnavailable=1
Resource-constrained node pool with reservation
Balanced (Default)
The simplest way to take advantage of surge upgrades is to use the default
configuration, maxSurge=1;maxUnavailable=0. With this configuration, upgrades
progress slowly, with only one surge node added at a time, meaning only
one node is upgraded at a time. Pods can restart immediately on the new, surge
node. This configuration only requires the resources to temporarily create one
new node.
Fast and no surge resources
If you have a large node pool and your workload isn't sensitive to disruption
(for example, a batch job that has run to completion), use the following
configuration to maximize speed without using any additional resources:
maxSurge=0;maxUnavailable=20 . This configuration does not bring up additional
surge nodes and allows 20 nodes to be upgraded at the same time.
Fast and less disruptive
If your workload is sensitive to disruption and you have already set up
PodDisruptionBudgets
(PDB) and you are not using externalTrafficPolicy: Local , which does not work
with parallel node drains, you can increase the speed of the upgrade by using
maxSurge=20;maxUnavailable=0 . This configuration upgrades 20 nodes in parallel
while the PDB limits the number of Pods that can be drained at a given time.
Although the configurations of PDBs may vary, if you create a PDB with
maxUnavailable=1 for one or more workloads running on the node pool, then
only one Pod of those workloads can be evicted at a time, limiting the
parallelism of the entire upgrade. This configuration requires the resources to
temporarily create 20 new nodes.
Slow but no surge resources
If you can't use any additional resources, you can use
maxSurge=0;maxUnavailable=1 to recreate one node at a time.
Control an in-progress surge upgrade
With surge upgrades, while an upgrade is in progress you can use commands to
exercise some control over it. For more control over the upgrade process, we
recommend using blue-green upgrades .
Cancel (pause) a surge upgrade
You can cancel an in-progress surge upgrade at any time during the upgrade
process. Cancelling pauses the upgrade, stopping GKE from
upgrading new nodes, but doesn't automatically roll back the upgrade of the
already-upgraded nodes. After you cancel an upgrade, you can either
resume or roll back .
When you cancel an upgrade, GKE does the following with each of
the nodes:
Nodes that have started the upgrade complete it.
Nodes that have not started the upgrade don't upgrade.
Nodes that have already successfully completed the upgrade are unaffected
and are not rolled back.
This means that the node pool might end up in a state where nodes are running
two different versions. If automatic upgrades
are enabled for the node pool, the node pool can be scheduled for auto-upgrade
again, which would upgrade the remaining nodes in the node pool running the
older version.
Learn how to cancel a node pool upgrade .
Resume a surge upgrade
If a node pool upgrade was canceled and left partially upgraded, you can resume
the upgrade to complete the upgrade process for the node pool. This will upgrade
any remaining nodes that had not been upgraded in the original operation. Learn
how to resume a node pool upgrade .
Roll back a surge upgrade
If a node pool is left partially upgraded, you can roll back the node pool to
revert it to its previous state. You can't roll back node pools after they have
been successfully upgraded. Nodes that have not started an upgrade are unaffected.
Learn how to roll back a node pool upgrade .
If you want to downgrade a node pool back to its previous version after the
upgrade is already complete, see Downgrading node pools .
Blue-green upgrades
Blue-green upgrades are an alternative upgrade strategy to the
default surge upgrade strategy. With blue-green upgrades,
GKE first creates a new set of node resources ("green" nodes)
with the new node configuration before evicting any workloads on the original
resources ("blue" nodes). GKE keeps the "blue" resources, if
needed, for rolling back workloads until their soaking time has been met. You
can adjust the pace of upgrades and soaking time based on your environment's
needs.
With this strategy, you have more control over the upgrade process. You can roll
back an in-progress upgrade, if necessary, as the original environment is
maintained during the upgrade. This upgrade strategy, however, is also more
resource intensive. As the original environment is replicated, the node pool
uses double the number of resources during the upgrade.
When to choose blue-green upgrades for your environment
If you have highly-available production workloads that you need to be able to
roll back quickly in case the workload does not tolerate the upgrade, and a
temporary cost increase is acceptable, we recommend choosing blue-green
upgrades for your node pools.
Blue-green upgrades are optimal
for the following scenarios:
if you want a gradual rollout where risk mitigation is most important, where
graceful termination greater than 60 minutes is needed.
if your workloads are less tolerant of disruptions.
if a temporary cost increase due to higher resource usage is acceptable.
Blue-green upgrades continue until completion if they exceed a
maintenance window .
For more information, see How node upgrade strategies work with maintenance
windows .
When GKE uses blue-green upgrades
For GKE nodes, there are different types of configuration changes
that require the nodes to be recreated. If enabled, GKE uses
blue-green upgrades when the following types of changes occur:
Version changes (upgrades)
Vertically scaling the nodes by changing the node machine attributes , including machine type, disk type, and disk size
Image type changes
Add or replace storage pools in a node pool
Surge upgrades are used for any other updates requiring the nodes to be
recreated. For more information, see When surge upgrades are
used .
Phases of blue-green upgrades
With blue-green upgrades, you can customize and control the
process by:
using the upgrade configuration parameters.
using commands to cancel (pause) ,
resume ,
roll back ,
or complete the steps.
This section explains the phases of the upgrade process. You can use upgrade
settings to tune how the phases work, and commands to control the upgrade
process .
Phase 1: Create green pool
In this phase, a new set of managed instance groups (MIGs)—known as the "green"
pool—are created for each zone under the target pool with the new node
configuration (new version or image type).
Quota will be checked
before starting provisioning new green resources.
In this phase, the original MIGs—known as the blue pool—cluster autoscaler will
stop scaling up or down. The green pool can only scale up in this phase.
In this phase, you can cancel the upgrade if
necessary. When you cancel a blue-green upgrade, the upgrade is
paused in its current phase. After you've canceled it, you can either
resume it or roll
back . At this phase, rolling back will delete
the green pool.
Phase 2: Cordon blue pool
In this phase, all the original nodes in the blue pool (existing MIGs) will be
cordoned (marked as unschedulable). Existing workloads will keep running, but
new workloads won't be scheduled on the existing nodes.
In this phase, you can cancel the upgrade if
necessary. When you cancel a blue-green upgrade, the upgrade is
paused in its current phase. After you've canceled it, you can either
resume it or roll
back . At this phase, rolling back will
un-cordon the blue pool and delete the green pool.
Phase 3: Drain blue pool
In this phase, the original nodes in the blue pool (existing MIGs) will be
drained in batches. When Kubernetes drains a nodes, eviction requests are sent
to all the Pods running on the node. The Pods will be rescheduled. For Pods that
have
PodDisruptionBudget
violations or long terminationGracePeriodSeconds
during the draining, they will be deleted in the Delete blue
pool phase when the node is deleted. You can use
BATCH_SOAK_DURATION and NODE_POOL_SOAK_DURATION , which are described here
and in the next section, to extend the period before Pods are deleted.
Note: To ensure that Pods evicted from nodes in the blue pool only get
rescheduled to nodes in the green pool, add a nodeSelector for the label
cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool: ${MY_NODE_POOL} to your workload. If you omit
this label and have other node pools in your cluster, your evicted Pods might be
scheduled to those nodes.
You can control the size of the batches with either of the following settings:
BATCH_NODE_COUNT : the absolute number of nodes to drain in a batch.
BATCH_PERCENT : the percentage of nodes to drain in a batch, expressed as a
decimal between 0 and 1, inclusive. GKE rounds down to the
nearest percentage of nodes, to a minimum value of 1 node, if the percentage
isn't a whole number of nodes.
If either of these settings are set to zero GKE skips this phase
and proceeds to the Soak node pool phase.
Additionally, you can control how long each batch drain soaks with
BATCH_SOAK_DURATION . This duration is defined in seconds, with the default
being zero seconds.
In this phase, you can still cancel the upgrade
if necessary. When you cancel a blue-green upgrade, the upgrade
is paused in its current phase. After you've canceled it, you can either
resume it or roll
back . If the previous batch is already drained
and you resume the upgrade, the next batch of nodes might be immediately
processed without honoring the BATCH_SOAK_DURATION for that batch. Rolling
back at this phase stops the draining of the blue pool and uncordons it.
Workloads can then be rescheduled on the blue pool (not guaranteed), and the
green pool is drained and deleted.
Phase 4: Soak node pool
This phase is used for you to verify the workload's health after the blue pool
nodes have been drained.
The soak time is set with NODE_POOL_SOAK_DURATION , in seconds. By default, it
is set to one hour (3600 seconds). If the total soak duration reaches 7 days
(604,800 seconds), the Delete blue pool phase
begins immediately.
The total soak duration is the sum of NODE_POOL_SOAK_DURATION , plus
BATCH_SOAK_DURATION multiplied by the number of batches, which is determined
by either BATCH_NODE_COUNT or BATCH_PERCENT .
In this phase, you can finish the upgrade and skip any remaining soak time by
completing the upgrade . This will immediately
begin the process of removing the blue pool nodes.
You can still cancel the upgrade if necessary.
When you cancel a blue-green upgrade, the upgrade is paused in
its current phase. After you've canceled it, you can either
resume it or roll
back .
In this phase, cluster autoscaler can now scale up or down the green pool as
normal.
Phase 5: Delete blue pool
After the expiration of the soaking time, the blue pool nodes will be removed
from the target pool. This phase can't be paused. Also, this phase does not use
eviction and instead attempts to delete the Pods. Unlike eviction, deletion
doesn't respect PDBs and forcibly deletes the Pods. The deletion caps a Pod's
terminationGracePeriodSeconds to no more than 60 minutes. After this final
attempt is made to delete the remaining Pods, the blue pool nodes are deleted
from the node pool.
At the completion of this phase, your node pool will have only new nodes with
the updated configuration (version or image type).
How cluster autoscaler works with blue-green upgrades
During the phases of a blue-green upgrade, the original "blue"
pool does not scale up or down. When the new "green" pool is created, it can
only be scaled up until the Soak node pool phase ,
where it can scale up or down. If an upgrade is rolled
back , the original "blue" pool might scale up
during this process if additional capacity is needed.
Control an in-progress blue-green upgrade
With blue-green upgrades, while an upgrade is in progress you can use commands
to exercise control over it. This gives you a high level of control over the
process in case you determine, for instance, that your workloads need to be
rolled back to the old node configuration.
Cancel (pause) a blue-green upgrade
When you cancel a blue-green upgrade, you pause the upgrade in
its current phase. This command can be used at all phases except the Delete
blue pool phase . When cancelled, the node pool will
be paused at an intermediate status based on the phase where the request was
issued.
Learn how to cancel a node pool
upgrade .
After an upgrade is canceled, you can choose one of two paths forward:
resume or roll
back .
Resume a blue-green upgrade
If you have determined the upgrade is okay to move forward, you can resume it.
If you resume, the upgrade process will continue at the intermediate phase it
was paused. To learn how to resume a node pool upgrade, see Resume a node pool upgrade .
Roll back a blue-green upgrade
If you have determined that the upgrade shouldn't move forward and you want to
bring the node pool back to its original state, you can roll back. To learn how
to roll back a node pool upgrade, see roll back a node pool upgrade .
With the roll back workflow, the process reverses itself to bring the node pool
back to its original state. The blue pool will be un-cordoned so that workloads
may be rescheduled on it. During this process, cluster autoscaler may scale up
the blue pool as needed. The green pool will be drained and deleted.
If you want to downgrade a node pool back to its previous version after the
upgrade is already complete, see Downgrading node pools .
Complete a blue-green upgrade
During the Soak phase , you can complete an upgrade
if you have determined that the workload does not need further validation on the
new node configuration and the old nodes can be removed. Completing an upgrade
skips the rest of the Soak phase and proceeds to the
Delete blue pool phase .
For more information about how to use the complete command, see Complete a
blue-green node pool
upgrade .
Autoscaled blue-green upgrades
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Note: Autoscaled blue-green upgrades require the cluster's
control plane to run version 1.34.0-gke.2201000 or later, and require cluster
autoscaling to be enabled.
Autoscaled blue-green upgrades are a different type of upgrade
strategy that maximizes the amount of time before disruption-intolerant
workloads are evicted, while minimizing cost. This strategy is derived from the
standard blue-green upgrades .
However, with autoscaled blue-green upgrades, GKE
doesn't drain nodes with workloads that are marked as not safe to evict for up
to seven days after the nodes are cordoned.
The following section explains when you should choose this strategy, how this
strategy's implementation of blue-green upgrades is different
from the standard blue-green upgrades, and what best practices
you should follow when using this strategy.
To use autoscaled blue-green upgrades, see Configure autoscaled
blue-green
upgrades .
When to choose autoscaled blue-green upgrades for your environment
If you have workloads that need the maximum amount of time before eviction, but
don't need to be rescheduled as quickly as possible, we recommend choosing
autoscaled blue-green upgrades for your node pools.
Autoscaled blue-green upgrades works well if these scenarios
apply to you:
You have batch workloads that must run to completion.
You want to minimize cost compared to standard blue-green
upgrades by minimizing the amount of idle or underutilized nodes.
You don't need Pods to be guaranteed immediate rescheduling, or immediate
rollback to the previous node configuration.
Choose standard blue-green upgrades if you need to minimize the
time to reschedule workloads to new nodes, and the ability to roll
back to the previous node configuration.
Autoscaled blue-green upgrades, like standard
blue-green upgrades, continue until completion if they exceed a
maintenance window .
For more information, see How node upgrade strategies work with maintenance
windows .
Phases of autoscaled blue-green upgrades
When GKE upgrades node pools with autoscaled
blue-green upgrades, the phases differ from standard
blue-green upgrades. For the standard upgrade strategy's phases,
see the phases of blue-green
upgrades .
When the autoscaled blue-green upgrades policy is enabled,
GKE performs these steps during an operation:
GKE creates the green pool .
However, the green pool starts with zero nodes. When GKE
evicts Pods from the blue pool in a later phase, cluster autoscaler scales
up the green pool to run those Pods.
GKE cordons the blue pool .
GKE waits for a period of time, which you can configure from
zero to seven days (with a default of three days). During this time,
GKE does the following:
Cluster autoscaler scales down underutilized blue pool nodes, unless those
nodes have Pods that are running the
"cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict": "false" annotation. This
annotation ensures that workloads needing the most time to spin down can
continue to run. If cluster autoscaler isn't actively scaling down
underutilized nodes, see Troubleshoot cluster autoscaler not scaling
down
and Consider Pod scheduling and
disruption .
GKE ignores the autoscaling
limits
of the --min-nodes and --total-min-nodes parameters when scaling down
the blue pool.
If all blue pool nodes are scaled down before this period of time is
complete, GKE immediately proceeds to the phase to delete
the blue pool .
GKE drains the blue pool ,
draining the remaining blue pool nodes up to 20 at a time in parallel.
GKE respects PodDisruptionBudget settings for up to 1 hour,
and terminationGracePeriodSeconds settings for up to 24 hours.
GKE skips the soak node pool
phase.
GKE deletes the blue pool .
Best practices for autoscaled blue-green upgrades
The following sections provide best practices—for your cluster, node pool, and
Pods—to minimize workload disruption during autoscaled blue-green
upgrades.
Cluster and node pool configuration
GKE respects the autoscaling
limits
when scaling up the green pool. Set the --max-nodes or --total-max-nodes
parameters high enough so that cluster autoscaler can scale up the green
pool when GKE reschedules workloads from the blue pool to the
green pool. GKE doesn't respect the --min-nodes or
--total-min-nodes parameters when scaling down the blue pool.
Configure the optimize-utilization autoscaling profile if you want
GKE to scale down underutilized nodes in the blue pool more
aggressively. For more information, see Autoscaling
profiles .
Don't update node pools created with node
auto-provisioning
to use autoscaled blue-green upgrades. Also, don't configure
your cluster to use autoscaled blue-green upgrades for new
auto-provisioned node
pools .
Pod configuration
To ensure that Pods are not evicted during the pause before draining the
blue pool, add the "cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict":
"false" annotation to those Pods. This annotation prevents cluster
autoscaler from evicting the Pod if the Pod's node is underutilized.
Like with standard blue-green upgrades, to help ensure that
Pods evicted from nodes in the blue pool only get rescheduled to nodes in
the green pool, add a nodeSelector for the
cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool: NODE_POOL_NAME label
to your workload. If you omit this label and have other node pools in your
cluster, your evicted Pods might be scheduled to nodes in those other node
pools.
Limitations of autoscaled blue-green upgrades
You can cancel and
resume autoscaled blue-green
upgrades; however, you can't roll back
the canceled upgrade.
When the blue pool is cordoned and drained, Pods can become temporarily
unschedulable if cluster autoscaler can't scale up the green pool due to
quotas and limits or resource
availability ,
because the green pool is created with zero nodes.
You can only upgrade node pools with autoscaled blue-green
upgrades if the cluster's control plane is running version
1.34.0-gke.2201000 or later, and cluster autoscaler is enabled.
When GKE uses autoscaled blue-green upgrades
GKE uses autoscaled blue-green upgrades for the
same types of changes as standard blue-green upgrades. For more
information about the types of changes GKE uses the standard
blue-green upgrade strategy for, see When GKE
uses blue-green upgrades .
How cluster autoscaler works with autoscaled blue-green upgrades
To configure autoscaled blue-green upgrades, you must also
configure cluster autoscaler.
If you use autoscaled blue-green upgrades, cluster autoscaler
does the following:
During the phase where GKE waits to drain the blue pool, the
blue pool doesn't scale up and is only scaled down by cluster autoscaler
when the nodes become underutilized. Cluster autoscaler can scale down the
blue pool to zero, without respecting the --min-nodes or
--total-min-nodes parameters. In all of the other phases, cluster
autoscaler doesn't scale up or down the blue pool.
Cluster autoscaler scales up the green pool from zero nodes, or down to the
--min-nodes setting, as required in all of the phases of the upgrade
strategy.
Short-lived upgrades (flex-start and queued provisioning only)
Short-lived upgrades are a node upgrade strategy exclusively for use with nodes
that use Flex-start VMs and nodes that use queued provisioning (with
1.32.2-gke.1652000 or later), both of which are powered by Dynamic Workload Scheduler.

GKE uses the short-lived upgrades strategy for Standard
node pools and groups of nodes in Autopilot clusters.
With this strategy, GKE upgrades these limited runtime nodes
without disrupting existing workloads. The strategy works in the following way:
Existing nodes run until they're preempted.
New nodes use the new node configuration.
Over a maximum of seven days, the nodes transition from running the existing
configuration to running the new configuration.
GKE automatically configures this strategy for
nodes that use Flex-start VMs. This strategy has no configuration settings.
When GKE uses short-lived upgrades
GKE automatically sets nodes that use Flex-start VMs to apply
short-lived upgrades. Nodes which only use queued provisioning, but run on
clusters on GKE version 1.32.2-gke.1652000 or later, also use
short-lived upgrades.
For Standard node pools and groups of nodes in Autopilot
clusters that use short-lived upgrades, GKE uses this strategy in
situations where surge upgrades would otherwise be used. In addition to node
upgrades (version changes), GKE uses short-lived upgrades for
other types of node updates, similar to how surge upgrades are used. For more
information, see When surge upgrades are used .
