Standard
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) DRANET
is a managed GKE feature that builds upon the open-source
DRANET project, which implements the
Kubernetes DRA API for networking resources. DRANET lets you request and allocate
high-performance networking resources for your Pods, including network
interfaces that support Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). This approach
provides a portable, upstream-aligned API for network resource management.
This document provides a conceptual overview of GKE DRANET and
shows you how to allocate network resources to workloads in your
GKE clusters.
This document is intended for Cloud architects and
Networking specialists who design networks for their organizations. For an
overview of all GKE documentation, see Explore GKE
documentation . To learn about common roles
and tasks referenced in Google Cloud content, see Common
GKE user roles and
tasks .

How GKE managed DRANET works
GKE managed DRANET is implemented through a networking-dra-driver
DaemonSet. This DaemonSet runs on nodes with GPUs or TPUs that have
GKE DRANET enabled.
It functions as a node-level agent to make
network interfaces discoverable and allocatable to Pods through the Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) APIs .
In GKE versions 1.34.1-gke.1829001 and later, GKE
automatically installs DeviceClass resources for networking. These classes
define the types of network devices that you can request. For example,
GKE creates the mrdma.google.com class for RDMA-capable devices
and the netdev.google.com class for other network devices.
To use GKE DRANET, you first enable the GKE DRANET
driver on a node pool with GPUs or TPUs.
To request network devices for a workload, define a ResourceClaimTemplate .
This template specifies the DeviceClass and the allocation mode, such as
requesting all available devices on a node. In your Pod specification, reference
this template in a resourceClaims field to grant your Pod access to the
requested network interfaces on the node.
When to use GKE managed DRANET
GKE DRANET provides a standardized way to manage network
resources that are aware of topology and dependencies. This standardization
makes it a suitable solution for AI and ML workloads that require
high-performance networking.
Common use cases for requesting network interfaces for a Pod include:
Requesting all available RDMA-capable interfaces.
Requesting a specific number of RDMA-capable interfaces.
Requesting all available non-RDMA interfaces.
Requesting a specific number of non-RDMA interfaces.
Key considerations by using GKE managed DRANET for networking
Consider the following points by using GKE DRANET for
networking:
Dedicated network interfaces
When you use GKE DRANET to claim a network interface for a
Pod, that interface is dedicated to that Pod. Other Pods on the same node
can't share it. This ensures that the Pod has sole access to the full
bandwidth and resources of that interface, which is a key benefit for
performance-sensitive workloads.
Use the GKE managed DRANET driver independently
You can enable the GKE DRA driver to manage network resources
without enabling other GKE DRANET drivers. To do so, add the
cloud.google.com/gke-networking-dra-driver=true label to a node pool with
GPUs and TPUs.
Use other GKE DRA drivers
To achieve higher throughput in demanding AI/ML workloads, combine the DRA
API for accelerators (like GPUs and TPUs) with GKE DRANET
managed networking. This combined approach improves resource alignment and
topology awareness. To learn more about using DRA for other resources, see
Prepare GKE infrastructure for DRA
workloads .
Avoid conflicting configurations
The GKE DRANET driver manages RDMA interfaces and gVNICs that
don't have any secondary IP address ranges configured. Don't use both the
GKE DRANET driver and the GKE multi-network
API with a Network resource of Device type in the same cluster. Using the
driver and API together is not supported because both APIs attempt to manage
the same set of NICs, which can lead to an incorrect setup and unpredictable
behavior.
Managed lifecycle of the DRANET driver
In GKE version 1.34 and later, GKE
automatically creates the managed gke-managed-networking-dra-driver
namespace in your cluster. Similar to several other GKE
system workloads, the DRANET driver's Pods only run on nodes where they are
relevant (such as nodes with GPUs, TPUs, and other specialized hardware). On
nodes where the driver is not relevant, no Pods for this driver run. Do not
manually modify the networking-dra-driver DaemonSet. Manual changes, such
as updating the nodeAffinity field, can interfere with GKE's
management of the DRANET feature and cause the DRANET daemon Pods to schedule
on unsupported nodes.
Requirements
To use GKE managed DRANET, your environment must meet the
following requirements:
Standard: 1.34.1-gke.1829001 or later.
Autopilot: 1.35.2-gke.1842000 or later.

Limitations
GKE DRANET has the following limitations:
You can't use GKE DRANET to allocate the default network
interface card (NIC) or virtual NICs (such as veth).
Certain instance types, specifically bare metal nodes like a4x-max , are
incompatible with Autoscaling and Autopilot clusters.
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure that you have performed the following tasks:
Enable
the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
Enable Google Kubernetes Engine API
If you want to use the Google Cloud CLI for this task,
install and then
initialize the
gcloud CLI. If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest
version by running the gcloud components update command. Earlier gcloud CLI versions might not support running the commands in this document.
Note: For existing gcloud CLI
installations, make sure to set the compute/region property . If you use primarily zonal clusters, set the compute/zone instead. By setting a default location,
you can avoid errors in the gcloud CLI like the following:
One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location . You might need to specify the location in certain commands if the location of your cluster differs from the default that you set.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to create node pools and allocate network resources,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Kubernetes Engine Admin ( roles/container.admin )
IAM role on your project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Create a cluster
Create a GKE Standard cluster that uses
GKE Dataplane V2:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-dataplane-v2 \
--region = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--cluster-version = CLUSTER_VERSION
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your new cluster.
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION : the region or zone for the
cluster control plane, such as us-central1 or us-central1-a .
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
CLUSTER_VERSION : the GKE version for
your cluster. This version must be 1.34.1-gke.1829001 or later.
Use RDMA interfaces from a GPU node pool
The following sections describe how to configure a GPU node pool and workload to
use RDMA network interfaces with GKE DRANET.
Enable GKE managed DRANET driver on a GPU node pool
To enable the GKE DRANET driver on a GPU node pool that supports
RDMA, add the cloud.google.com/gke-networking-dra-driver=true label when you
create the node pool.
gcloud beta container node-pools create NODE_POOL_NAME \
--region = REGION \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--node-locations = NODE_LOCATIONS \
--accelerator type = ACCELERATOR_TYPE ,count = ACCELERATOR_COUNT ,gpu-driver-version = DRIVER_VERSION \
--machine-type = MACHINE_TYPE \
--num-nodes = NUM_NODES \
--reservation-affinity = specific \
--reservation = projects/ RESERVATION_PROJECT /reservations/ RESERVATION_NAME /reservationBlocks/ RESERVATION_BLOCK \
--accelerator-network-profile = auto \
--node-labels = cloud.google.com/gke-networking-dra-driver = true
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : the name of your new node pool.
REGION : the Google Cloud region for your cluster.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your cluster.
ACCELERATOR_TYPE : the type of GPU accelerator :
For example:
A4 VMs: enter nvidia-b200 .
A3 Ultra VMs: enter nvidia-h200-141gb .
ACCELERATOR_COUNT : the number of GPUs to attach to nodes in the node pool. For example, for both a4-highgpu-8g and a3-ultragpu-8g VMs, the amount of GPUs is 8.
DRIVER_VERSION : the GPU driver version to use. For example, default or latest .
MACHINE_TYPE : the machine type for the node pool, for example, a3-ultragpu-8g .
NUM_NODES : the number of nodes for the node pool. For flex-start, this value must be set to 0.
RESERVATION_PROJECT : the project ID of the reservation.
RESERVATION_NAME : the name of your reservation. To find this value, see View future reservation requests .
RESERVATION_BLOCK : the name of a specific block within the reservation. To find this value, see View future reservation requests .
This command uses accelerator network profiles to automatically configure
VPC networks and subnets for your accelerator VMs. Alternatively,
you can explicitly specify your VPC network and subnets.
Deploy a workload RDMA resources
To allocate RDMA resources for a Pod, specify a ResourceClaimTemplate .
Create a ResourceClaimTemplate to define how to allocate the RDMA devices.
The following manifest requests all available mrdma devices on the node.
Save the manifest as all-mrdma-template.yaml :
apiVersion : resource.k8s.io/v1
kind : ResourceClaimTemplate
metadata :
name : all-mrdma
spec :
spec :
devices :
requests :
- name : req-mrdma
exactly :
deviceClassName : mrdma.google.com
allocationMode : All
Apply the manifest:
kubectl apply -f all-mrdma-template.yaml
Deploy your workload and reference the ResourceClaimTemplate . The
following manifest deploys a Pod that references the all-mrdma template,
which grants the Pod access to the RDMA interfaces on the node. Save the
manifest as agnhost-rdma-pod.yaml :

The following example output shows the default eth0 and lo interfaces,
along with the allocated network devices, which have names like eth1 and
eth2 . The number of NICs and their names will vary based on the machine type
of the GKE node.
eth0
eth1
eth2
lo
Enable DRANET with custom ComputeClass
To use GKE managed DRANET in Autopilot clusters or with
node auto-provisioning
in Standard clusters, you must use a custom ComputeClass resource to opt-in to
the feature.
Create a ComputeClass manifest that enables the DRANET driver and sets the
accelerator network profile to auto :
apiVersion : cloud.google.com/v1
kind : ComputeClass
metadata :
