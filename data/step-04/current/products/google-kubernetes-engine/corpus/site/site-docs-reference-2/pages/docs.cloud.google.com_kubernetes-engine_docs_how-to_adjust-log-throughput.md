Adjust log throughput

Standard
This document describes default log throughput and how to increase throughput.
When system logging is enabled, a dedicated Logging agent is
automatically deployed and managed. It runs
on all GKE nodes in a cluster to collect logs, adds helpful
metadata about the container, pod, and cluster, and then sends the logs to
Cloud Logging using a fluentbit-based agent.
The dedicated Logging agent provides at least 100 KiB per
second log throughput per node for system and workload logs. If a node is
underutilized, then depending on the type of log load (for example, text or
structured log entries, very few containers on the node or many containers),
the dedicated logging agent might provide throughput as much as 500 KiB per
second or more. Additionally, in clusters with GKE control
plane version 1.23.13-gke.1000 or later, the Logging
agent allows for throughput as high as 10 MiB per second on nodes that have at
least 2 unused CPU cores. Be aware, however, that at higher throughputs, some
logs may be lost.
Identify nodes with higher log throughput
By default, GKE clusters collect
system metrics .
The system metric kubernetes.io/node/logs/input_bytes provides
the number of log bytes generated per second on a node. This metric can help
you decide which variant of the logging agent makes sense to deploy in your
cluster or node pools.
To view the historical logging throughput for each node in your cluster, follow
these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
leaderboard Metrics explorer page:
Go to Metrics explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
In the Select a metric field, select
kubernetes.io/node/logs/input_bytes .
In the Group by field, select project_id , location ,
cluster_name , and node_name .
Click OK
Optionally, sort the list of metrics in descending order by clicking the
column header Value above the list of metrics.
To understand how much logging volume is due to system components or due to
workloads running on the node, you may also group by the type metric label.
Enable high-throughput logging
If any GKE nodes require more than 100 KiB per second log
throughput and your GKE Standard cluster is using
control plane version 1.23.13-gke.1000 or later, you can configure
GKE to deploy an alternative configuration of the
Logging agent designed to maximize logging throughput. This
maximum throughput Logging variant allows for throughput as high
as 10 MiB per second per node. You can deploy this high-throughput
Logging agent to all nodes in a cluster or to all nodes in a
node pool.
This high-throughput configuration will consume additional CPU and memory.
Warning: Changing the logging agent on an existing node pool recreates all
nodes. If you change the logging agent for an existing cluster, the existing
node pools are unaffected and the change only applies to new node pools added to
the cluster.
gcloud CLI
To enable high-throughput logging on all nodes in a new cluster:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = COMPUTE_LOCATION \
--logging-variant = MAX_THROUGHPUT \
--machine-type = MACHINE_TYPE
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the new cluster.
COMPUTE_LOCATION : the
Compute Engine location
for the new cluster.
MACHINE_TYPE : a machine type that has enough CPU
for the Logging agent, such as e2-standard-8 .
All newly created node pools in this cluster, including the default node
pool, deploy the high-throughput Logging agent.
To confirm if high-throughput logging is already set for an existing cluster, use the
gcloud container cluster describe
command:
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = COMPUTE_LOCATION \
--format = "value(nodePoolDefaults[].loggingConfig.variantConfig.variant)"
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
COMPUTE_LOCATION : the
Compute Engine location
of the cluster.
Note: A DEFAULT output indicates the value remains unset, whereas a MAX_THROUGHPUT output
signifies that it has been configured.
To configure high-throughput logging for an existing cluster:
use the gcloud container clusters update
command:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = COMPUTE_LOCATION \
--logging-variant = MAX_THROUGHPUT
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
COMPUTE_LOCATION : the
Compute Engine location
of the cluster.
To create a new node pool that uses the high-throughput
Logging agent, use the
gcloud container node-pools create
command:
gcloud container node-pools create NODEPOOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = COMPUTE_LOCATION \
--logging-variant = MAX_THROUGHPUT
Replace the following:
NODEPOOL_NAME : the name of the new node pool.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
COMPUTE_LOCATION : the
Compute Engine location
for the new cluster.
To confirm if high-throughput logging is already set for an existing node pool use the
gcloud container node-pools describe
command:
gcloud container node-pools describe NODEPOOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = COMPUTE_LOCATION \
--format = "value(config.loggingConfig.variantConfig.variant)"
Replace the following:
NODEPOOL_NAME : the name of the node pool.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
COMPUTE_LOCATION : the
Compute Engine location .
Note: An EMPTY or DEFAULT output indicates the value remains unset, whereas a MAX_THROUGHPUT output
signifies that it has been configured.
To update an existing node pool, use the
gcloud container node-pools update
command.
gcloud container node-pools update NODEPOOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = COMPUTE_LOCATION \
--logging-variant = MAX_THROUGHPUT
Replace the following:
NODEPOOL_NAME : the name of the node pool.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
COMPUTE_LOCATION : the
Compute Engine location .
Terraform
The following code blocks specify how to declare node pools with or without
high-throughput logging.
To manage the node pools explicitly, you must specify your cluster without a
default node pool.
resource "google_container_cluster" "with_example_logging_variants" {
provider = google
name = " CLUSTER_NAME "
location = " COMPUTE_LOCATION "
initial_node_count = 1
remove_default_node_pool = true # We want to manage our node pools separately.
}
To specify a node pool that uses the high-throughput agent, use the node_config
field to specify the Logging agent variant as MAX_THROUGHPUT
and an appropriate machine type:
resource "google_container_node_pool" "with_example_logging_variant" {
provider = google
name = "example-node-pool-with-htl"
cluster = google_container_cluster.with_example_logging_variants.name
location = " COMPUTE_LOCATION "
node_config {
logging_variant = "MAX_THROUGHPUT"
# Use a machine type with enough CPU to accommodate the high-throughput agent, such as e2-standard-8.
machine_type = "e2-standard-8"
}
node_count = 1
}
To specify a node pool that uses the default agent, use the node_config field
to specify the Logging agent variant as DEFAULT :
resource "google_container_node_pool" "with_default_logging_variant" {
provider = google
name = "example-node-pool-with-default-logging"
cluster = google_container_cluster.with_example_logging_variants.name
location = " COMPUTE_LOCATION "
node_config {
logging_variant = "DEFAULT"
}
node_count = 1
}
Disable high-throughput logging
If you no longer want to use the high-throughput Logging agent,
deploy the default Logging agent to the cluster or node pool.
Warning: Changing the logging agent on an existing node pool recreates all
nodes. If you change the logging agent for an existing cluster, the existing
node pools are unaffected and the change only applies to new node pools added to
the cluster.
gcloud CLI
Pass the flag --logging-variant=DEFAULT when you create or update a cluster
or node pool.
To use the default logging agent on all nodes in a new cluster:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = COMPUTE_LOCATION \
--logging-variant = DEFAULT \
--machine-type = MACHINE_TYPE
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the new cluster.
COMPUTE_LOCATION : the
Compute Engine location
for the new cluster.
MACHINE_TYPE : a machine type that has enough CPU
for the Logging agent, such as e2-standard-8 .
To use the default logging agent on an existing cluster:
use the gcloud container clusters update
command:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = COMPUTE_LOCATION \
--logging-variant = DEFAULT
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
COMPUTE_LOCATION : the
Compute Engine location
of the cluster.
To use the default logging agent for a new node pool, use the
gcloud container node-pools create
command:
gcloud container node-pools create NODEPOOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = COMPUTE_LOCATION \
--logging-variant = DEFAULT
Replace the following:
NODEPOOL_NAME : the name of the new node pool.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
COMPUTE_LOCATION : the
Compute Engine location
for the new cluster.
To update an existing node pool, use the
gcloud container node-pools update
command:
gcloud container node-pools update NODEPOOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = COMPUTE_LOCATION \
--logging-variant = DEFAULT
Replace the following:
NODEPOOL_NAME : the name of the node pool.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
COMPUTE_LOCATION : the
Compute Engine location .
Terraform
If you no longer want Terraform to create node pools that use the high-throughput Logging agent, set the logging_variant field to DEFAULT .
