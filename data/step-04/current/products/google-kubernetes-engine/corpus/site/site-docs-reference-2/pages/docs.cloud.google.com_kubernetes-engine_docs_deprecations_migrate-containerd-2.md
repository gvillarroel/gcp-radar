Autopilot
Standard
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters use containerd node
images with
all worker nodes that run version 1.24 and later. The worker nodes use a
specific version of containerd, based on the operating system and
GKE minor version:
Container-Optimized OS and Ubuntu nodes (Linux) :
Linux nodes that run GKE 1.32 or earlier, with containerd
node images, use containerd 1.7 or earlier versions.
Linux nodes that run GKE 1.33 use containerd 2.0.
Windows Server nodes :
Windows Server nodes that run GKE 1.34 or earlier, with
containerd node images, use containerd 1.7 or earlier versions.
Windows Server nodes that run GKE 1.35 use containerd
2.0.
When GKE nodes are upgraded to the respective GKE
minor version, the nodes migrate from using containerd 1.7 to the new major
version, containerd 2.0. You can't change which containerd version a
GKE version uses.
You can skip reading this page if you know that your workloads run as expected
on containerd 2.
How GKE is transitioning to containerd 2
Review the following timeline to understand how GKE is
transitioning existing clusters to use containerd 2:
For Linux nodes with 1.32 and Windows Server nodes with 1.34,
GKE uses containerd 1.7. containerd
1.7 deprecated both Docker Schema 1 images and the Container Runtime
Interface (CRI) v1alpha2 API. To learn about other features deprecated in
earlier versions, see Deprecated config
properties .
For Linux nodes with 1.33 and Windows Server nodes with 1.35,
GKE uses containerd 2.0, which removes support for Docker
Schema 1 images and the CRI v1alpha2 API.
The following containerd config properties in the CRI plugin are deprecated
and will be removed in containerd 2.2, with a GKE version yet
to be announced: registry.auths , registry.configs , registry.mirrors .
registry.configs.tls , however, was already removed in containerd 2.0.
For approximate timing of automatic upgrades to later minor versions, see the
Estimated schedule for release
channels .
Impact of the transition to containerd 2
Read the following section to understand the impact of this transition to
containerd 2.
Paused automatic upgrades
GKE pauses automatic upgrades in the following ways, depending on
the cluster's current minor version and if the nodes in the cluster are Linux
nodes or Windows Server nodes.
Paused automatic upgrades for Linux nodes
GKE pauses automatic
upgrades
to 1.33 for clusters with Linux nodes when it detects that the cluster uses the
deprecated features. However, if your cluster nodes use these features, we
recommend creating a maintenance
exclusion
to prevent cluster upgrades. The maintenance exclusion ensures that your cluster
isn't upgraded if GKE doesn't detect usage.
After you migrate from using these features, GKE resumes
automatic minor upgrades to 1.33 if the following are true:
GKE hasn't detected usage of deprecated features in 14 days,
or 3 days for deprecated CRI registry.configs properties.
1.33 is an automatic upgrade target for your cluster.
There are no other blocking factors. For more information, see The timing
of automatic
upgrades .
You can also manually upgrade the
cluster .
Paused automatic upgrades for Windows Server nodes
GKE pauses automatic upgrades to 1.35 for any clusters with
Windows Server nodes, regardless of whether the cluster uses the deprecated
features. GKE can't detect whether Windows Server nodes are
using the deprecated features.
To upgrade your cluster with Windows Server nodes to 1.35, first follow the
instructions to Migrate from deprecated features . After you've
followed these instructions, you can manually upgrade the
cluster to 1.35.
End of support and the impact of failing to prepare for migration
GKE pauses automatic upgrades until the end of standard
support . If your cluster
is enrolled in the Extended
channel , your nodes
can remain on a version until the end of extended
support . For more
details about automatic node upgrades at the end of support, see Automatic
upgrades at the end of
support .
If you don't migrate from these features, when 1.32 (for Linux nodes) or 1.34
(for Windows Server nodes) reaches the end of support, and your cluster nodes
are automatically upgraded to 1.33 or 1.35, you could experience the following
issues with your clusters:
Workloads using Docker Schema 1 images fail.
Applications calling the CRI v1alpha2 API experience failures calling the
API.
Identify affected clusters
GKE monitors your clusters and uses the Recommender
service to deliver guidance through insights and
recommendations for identifying Linux nodes in your cluster that use these
deprecated features. GKE doesn't detect usage from Windows
Server nodes.
Version requirements
Clusters receive these insights and recommendations if they're running the
following versions or later:
1.28.15-gke.1159000
1.29.9-gke.1541000
1.30.5-gke.1355000
1.31.1-gke.1621000
Get insights and recommendations
Follow the instructions to view insights and
recommendations .
You can get insights using the Google Cloud console. You can also use the
Google Cloud CLI or the Recommender API, by filtering with the following
subtypes:
DEPRECATION_CONTAINERD_V1_SCHEMA_IMAGES: Docker Schema 1 images
DEPRECATION_CONTAINERD_V1ALPHA2_CRI_API: CRI v1alpha2 API
DEPRECATION_CONTAINERD_V2_CONFIG_REGISTRY_CONFIGS : Deprecated CRI
registry.configs properties, including registry.configs.auth and
registry.configs.tls
Migrate from deprecated features
Review the following content to understand how to migrate from features
deprecated with containerd 2.
Migrate from Docker Schema 1 images
Identify workloads using images that must be migrated, then migrate those
workloads.
A Google-provided image affected by this issue is
gcr.io/google-containers/startup-script .
gcr.io/google-containers/startup-script:v1 : uses the deprecated Schema 1
format and can't be pulled on GKE 1.33 and later for Linux
nodes.
gcr.io/google-containers/startup-script:v2 : uses the supported Schema 2
format and can be pulled successfully.
If you are using gcr.io/google-containers/startup-script:v1 in any of your
workloads (such as DaemonSets or Deployments), you must update the image
reference to gcr.io/google-containers/startup-script:v2 .
Find images to be migrated
You can use different tools to find images that must be migrated.
Use insights and recommendations or Cloud Logging
As explained in the Identify affected clusters section,
you can use insights and recommendations to find clusters with Linux nodes that
use Docker Schema 1 images if your cluster is running a minimum version or
later. Additionally, you can use the following query in Cloud Logging to
check containerd logs to find Docker Schema 1 images in your cluster:
jsonPayload.SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER="containerd"
"conversion from schema 1 images is deprecated"
If more than 30 days have passed since the image was pulled, you might not see
logs for an image.
Use the ctr command directly on a node
To query a specific node to return all non-deleted images that were pulled as
Schema 1, run the following command on a node:
ctr --namespace k8s.io images list 'labels."io.containerd.image/converted-docker-schema1"'
This command can be useful if, for example, you're troubleshooting a specific
node and you don't see log entries in Cloud Logging because it's been more
than 30 days since the image was pulled.
Use the crane open-source tool
You can also use open-source tools such as
crane
to check for images.
Run the following crane command to check the schema version for an image:
crane manifest $tagged_image | jq .schemaVersion
Prepare workloads
To prepare workloads that run Docker Schema 1 images, you must migrate those
workloads to Schema 2 Docker images, or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images.
Consider the following options for migrating:
Find a replacement image: you might be able to find a publicly available
open-source or vendor-provided image.
Convert the existing image: if you can't find a replacement image, you
can convert existing Docker Schema 1 images to OCI images with the following
steps:
Pull the Docker image into containerd, which automatically converts it
to an OCI image.
Push the new OCI image to your registry.
Migrate from the CRI v1alpha2 API
The CRI v1alpha2 API was removed in Kubernetes
1.26 . You must identify
workloads that access the containerd socket and update these applications to use
the v1 API.
Identify potentially affected workloads
You can use different techniques to identify workloads that might need to be
migrated. These techniques might generate false positives which you must
further investigate to determine that no action is needed.
Use insights and recommendations
You can use insights and recommendations to find clusters with Linux nodes that
use the v1alpha2 API if your cluster is running a minimum version or later. For
more details, see Identify affected clusters .
When viewing insights in the Google Cloud console, see the sidebar panel
Migrate your workloads off deprecated CRI v1alpha2 API . The Workloads to
Verify table in this panel lists workloads that might be affected. This list
includes any workloads that are not managed by GKE that have
hostPath volumes containing the containerd socket path (for example,
/var/run/containerd/containerd.sock or /run/containerd/containerd.sock ).
It's important to understand the following:
The list of workloads to verify can contain false positives. Use it only
for investigation. A workload appearing in this list does not
definitively mean it is using the deprecated API, and the presence of a
false positive will not pause auto-upgrades. Pausing is based only on
the actually observed usage of the deprecated API.
This list might be empty or incomplete. An empty or incomplete list can
happen if workloads that use the deprecated API were short-lived and not
running when GKE performed its periodic check. The presence
of the recommendation itself means that CRI v1alpha2 API usage was detected
on at least one node in your cluster. Auto-upgrades resume after the
deprecated API usage has not been detected for 14 days.
Therefore, we recommend further investigation by using the following methods to
confirm actual API usage.
Check for affected third-party workloads
For third-party software deployed to your clusters, verify that these workloads
don't use the CRI v1alpha2 API. You might need to contact the respective vendors
to verify which versions of their software are compatible.
Use kubectl
The following command helps you find potentially affected workloads by looking
for those that access the containerd socket. It uses similar logic to the one
used for the Workloads to Verify table in the Google Cloud console
recommendation. It returns workloads not managed by GKE that have
hostPath volumes including the socket's path. Like the recommendation, this
query might return false positives or miss short-lived workloads.
Run the following command:
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | \
jq -r '
[
"/", "/var", "/var/","/var/run", "/var/run/",
"/var/run/containerd", "/var/run/containerd/", "/var/run/containerd/containerd.sock",
"/run", "/run/", "/run/containerd", "/run/containerd/",
"/run/containerd/containerd.sock"
] as $socket_paths |
[
"kube-system", "kube-node-lease", "istio-system", "asm-system",
"gatekeeper-system", "config-management-system", "config-management-monitoring",
"cnrm-system", "hnc-system", "gke-managed-system", "gke-gmp-system",
"gmp-system", "gke-managed-cim"
] as $excluded_namespaces |
.items[] |
select(
(.spec.volumes[]?.hostPath.path as $p | $socket_paths | index($p))
and
([.metadata.namespace] | inside($excluded_namespaces) | not)
) |
.metadata.namespace + "/" + .metadata.name
'
Use eBPF tracing to identify API callers
For a more definitive way to identify which workloads running on Linux nodes
call the CRI v1alpha2 API, you can deploy two specialized DaemonSets:
The containerd-socket-tracer logs any process opening a connection to the
containerd socket, along with the Pod and container details.
The cri-v1alpha2-api-deprecation-reporter logs the last time the CRI
v1alpha2 API was called.
These tools use Extended Berkeley Packet Filter
(eBPF) to trace connections to the
containerd socket and correlate the connections with actual deprecated API
calls.
You can't deploy these DaemonSets on Windows Server nodes.
By correlating the timestamps from these two tools, you can pinpoint the exact
workload making the deprecated API call. This method provides a higher degree of
confidence than checking for hostPath volumes alone, because it observes
actual socket connections and API usage.
For detailed instructions about how to deploy and use these tools, and how to
interpret their logs, see
Tracing containerd Socket Connections .
If, after using these tools, you are still unable to identify the source of the
deprecated API calls but the recommendation remains active, see
Get support .
After you identify a workload that is using the CRI v1alpha2 API, either through
the preceding methods or by inspecting your codebase, you must update its code
to use the v1 API.
Update application code
To update your application, remove where the application imports the
k8s.io/cri-api/pkg/apis/runtime/v1alpha2 client library and modify the code to
use the v1 version of the API. This step involves changing the import path and
updating how your code calls the API.
For example, see the following golang code, which uses the deprecated library:
package main
import (
...
runtimeapi "k8s.io/cri-api/pkg/apis/runtime/v1alpha2"
)
func foo () {
...
client := runtimeapi . NewRuntimeServiceClient ( conn )
version , err := client . Version ( ctx , & runtimeapi . VersionRequest {})
...
}
Here, the application imports the v1alpha2 library and uses it to issue RPCs. If
the RPCs use the connection to the containerd socket, then this application is
causing GKE to pause auto-upgrades for the cluster.
Do the following steps to search and update your application code:
Identify problematic golang applications by running the following command to
search for the v1alpha2 import path:
grep -r "k8s.io/cri-api/pkg/apis/runtime/v1alpha2"
If the output of this command shows that the v1alpha2 library is used in the
file, you must update the file.
For example, replace the following application code:
runtimeapi "k8s.io/cri-api/pkg/apis/runtime/v1alpha2"
Update the code to use v1:
runtimeapi "k8s.io/cri-api/pkg/apis/runtime/v1"
Migrate from deprecated containerd config properties
The registry.auths , registry.configs , and registry.mirrors containerd
config properties in the CRI plugin are deprecated and will be removed in
containerd 2.2, with a GKE version yet to be announced.
registry.configs.tls , however, was already removed in containerd 2.0.
Identify workloads
You can use different techniques to identify workloads that must be migrated.
Use insights and recommendations
As an initial approach, you can use insights and recommendations to find
clusters with Linux nodes that use the deprecated containerd config properties.
This requires a minimum GKE version. For more information about
this approach, see Identify affected clusters .
When viewing insights in the Google Cloud console, see the sidebar panel
Migrate your containerd configuration off deprecated CRI registry auths
field or
Migrate your containerd configuration off deprecated CRI registry mirrors
field . To find workloads that might access the containerd configuration, check
the
Workloads to Verify section.
Use kubectl
Alternatively, you can use kubectl to identify workloads.
Locate workloads that modify the containerd configuration by checking for
workloads with the following attributes:
Workloads that contain a hostPath volume that includes the containerd
config
Workloads that have a container with privileged access
( spec.containers.securityContext.privileged: true ) and use the host
process ID (PID) namespace ( spec.hostPID: true )
This command might return false positives because the workload might access
other files in these directories that aren't the containerd configuration. Or,
this command might not return workloads which access the containerd
configuration file in other, less common, ways.
Run the following command to check for the DaemonSets:
kubectl get daemonsets --all-namespaces -o json | \
jq -r '
[
"/", "/etc", "/etc/",
"/etc/containerd", "/etc/containerd/",
"/etc/containerd/config.toml"
] as $host_paths |
[
"kube-system", "kube-node-lease", "istio-system", "asm-system",
"gatekeeper-system", "config-management-system", "config-management-monitoring",
"cnrm-system", "hnc-system", "gke-managed-system", "gke-gmp-system",
"gmp-system", "gke-managed-cim"
] as $excluded_namespaces |
.items[] |
select(
([.metadata.namespace] | inside($excluded_namespaces) | not)
and
(
(any(.spec.template.spec.volumes[]?.hostPath.path; IN($host_paths[])))
or
(
.spec.template.spec.hostPID == true and
any(.spec.template.spec.containers[]; .securityContext?.privileged == true)
)
)
) |
.metadata.namespace + "/" + .metadata.name
'
Migrate from the CRI registry auths or configs.auth properties
If your workloads use the auths or configs.auth properties in the containerd
config to authenticate to a private registry for pulling container images, you
must migrate the workloads using those images to the imagePullSecrets field
instead. For more information, see Pull an Image from a Private
Registry .
To identify and migrate workloads that use the deprecated auths or
configs.auth properties, review the following instructions.
Locate the authentication details for your registry
You can locate the authentication details for your registry in one of the
following ways:
Review the CRI registry auths and configs.auth sections in the
/etc/containerd/config.toml file by connecting to a GKE
node.
Find the workload that modifies your containerd configuration file and see
what authentication details are included using the previously described
methods for identifying workloads .
GKE doesn't use these settings for its system workloads.
If you use the registry.configs.auth property, the authentication details
might look like the following:
[plugins. "io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri" .registry.configs. "$REGISTRY_DOMAIN" .auth]
username = "example-user"
password = "example-password"
Collect these authentication details for each registry domain that's specified
in your configuration.
Update your workload to use the imagePullSecrets field
Create a Secret with your authentication details from the previous section
by following the instructions to pull an image from a Private
Registry .
Identify which workloads need to be migrated to the imagePullSecrets field
by running the following command:
kubectl get pods -A -o json |
jq -r ".items[] |
select(.spec.containers[] |
.image | startswith(\" $REGISTRY_DOMAIN \")) |
.metadata.namespace + \"/\" + .metadata.name"
You must create a Secret for each namespace that's used by workloads with
images from this registry domain.
Update your workloads to use the imagePullSecrets field with the Secrets
that you created in the previous step.
Alternatively, if you need to migrate a large number of workloads, you can
implement a
MutatingAdmissionWebhook
to add the imagePullSecrets field.
Update your containerd config to stop setting registry auths
After your migrate your workloads to use the imagePullSecrets field, you must
update your workloads that modify your containerd configuration to stop setting
registry auths. For any workloads that you identified as modifying the
configuration, modify the workloads to stop setting registry auths.
Test with a new node pool and migrate workloads to the new node pool
To mitigate the risk of causing issues with your workloads, do the following:
Create a new node pool.
Schedule the updated workload that modifies your containerd configuration to
nodes in the new node pool.
Migrate your remaining workloads to the new node pool by following the
instructions to migrate workloads between node
pools .
Migrate from the CRI registry configs.tls property
If your workloads use the registry.configs.tls property, you must migrate
those workloads to access private registries with private CA certificates.
Follow the instructions to migrate from configuration DaemonSets . This
process is done with the following steps:
Update your workloads that modify the containerd config to stop setting TLS
details.
Store the certificates in Secret Manager.
Create a runtime configuration file that points to your certificates.
Create a new node pool and test that your workloads that use images hosted
from the private registry work as expected.
Apply the configuration to a new cluster and start running the workloads on
that cluster, or apply the configuration to the existing cluster. Applying
the configuration to the existing cluster could potentially disrupt other
existing workloads. For more information about these two approaches, see
Create a runtime configuration
file .
After you migrate, ensure that you stop applying any changes to your
registry.configs field or you might experience issues with containerd.
