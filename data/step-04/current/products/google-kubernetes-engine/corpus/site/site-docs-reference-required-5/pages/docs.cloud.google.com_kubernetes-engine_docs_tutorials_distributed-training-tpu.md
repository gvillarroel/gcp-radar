Standard
This tutorial shows you how to train the Llama 3 8B large language model (LLM)
on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using
MaxText ,
Ray Train , and TPUs.
This tutorial provides a complete, end-to-end walkthrough, from configuring the
necessary cloud infrastructure to submitting and successfully running the
training workload on multi-host TPUs.
This tutorial is for Platform admins and operators and Data and AI specialists who
want to learn how to train large models on a distributed, multi-host TPU slice.
Background
The combination of GKE, KubeRay, MaxText, and TPUs provides a
powerful and scalable platform for large-scale model training. This section
describes the key technologies used in this guide:
JAX
JAX is a Python library for
accelerator-oriented array computation and program transformation, designed for
high-performance numerical computing and large-scale machine learning.
JAX provides an extensible system for transforming numerical functions like
jax.grad , jax.jit , and jax.vmap , utilizing the XLA compiler to create
highly optimized code that scales efficiently on accelerators like GPUs and
TPUs. The core power of JAX lies in its composability, which allows users to
combine these transformations to build complex, high-performance numerical
programs for distributed execution.
MaxText
MaxText is a high-performance, open-source
large language model (LLM) designed for scalability and customizability. MaxText
is built on top of JAX and optimized to run efficiently on Cloud TPU and
GPUs.
TPUs
Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), are
custom-designed accelerators created by Google to optimize machine learning
workloads. Unlike general-purpose CPUs or parallel-processing GPUs, TPUs are
highly specialized for the massive matrix and tensor computations at the foundation
of deep learning, making them efficient at this specific task. The
primary advantage of TPUs is performance at scale.
This tutorial uses TPU Trillium, which is the sixth generation of TPUs.
For more information, see Benefits of using TPU Trillium .
KubeRay
KubeRay is a Kubernetes operator that
provides a unified way to deploy, manage, and monitor Ray applications on
Kubernetes. The KubeRay operator is installed and managed through the
Ray on GKE add-on ,
which is the recommended way to deploy and manage Ray clusters on
GKE.
Objectives
This tutorial shows you how to do the following:
Set up a GKE cluster with a multi-host TPU node pool.
Configure KubeRay to manage the distributed training environment.
Build a custom Docker image that contains MaxText, Ray, and JAX
dependencies.
Create a Python training script that uses Ray Train's JaxTrainer to
orchestrate the MaxText training loop across the TPU slice.
Define a RayCluster custom resource to provision the head and worker nodes
with the necessary TPU resources.
Submit the training Job to the RayCluster and monitor its progress.
Use Cloud Storage to store model checkpoints.

Because this tutorial utilizes TPU Trillium (v6e), select a region or
zone with availability. For more information, see
Cloud TPU quotas .
Prepare your environment
In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell . Cloud Shell comes
preinstalled with the gcloud , helm , and kubectl command-line tools that
are used in this tutorial.
Go to the Google Cloud console .
At the top of the Google Cloud console window, click the Activate
Cloud Shell button.
A Cloud Shell session opens inside a new frame in the
Google Cloud console and displays a command-line prompt.
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
python3 -m venv ray-env
source ray-env/bin/activate
Install the Ray CLI and other dependencies:
pip install "ray[default]==2.49.1"
Set the following environment variables:
export PROJECT_ID = $( gcloud config get project )
export PROJECT_NUMBER = $( gcloud projects describe ${ PROJECT_ID } --format = "value(projectNumber)" )
export GS_BUCKET = GS_BUCKET
export KSA_NAME = KSA_NAME
export NAMESPACE = default
export CLUSTER_NAME = CLUSTER_NAME
export REGION = REGION
export ZONE = ZONE
export ARTIFACT_REGISTRY = ARTIFACT_REGISTRY
Replace the following:
GS_BUCKET : the name of the Cloud Storage
bucket.
KSA_NAME : the name of the Kubernetes Service
Account.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the new cluster.
REGION : the region where your TPU Trillium
capacity is available.
ZONE : the zone where your TPU Trillium capacity
is available. For more information, see TPU availability in
GKE .
ARTIFACT_REGISTRY : the name of the
Artifact Registry repository.
Create a GKE cluster
You can configure KubeRay on TPUs in a GKE
Autopilot or Standard cluster. We recommend that you use a
Autopilot cluster for a fully managed Kubernetes experience. To choose
the GKE mode of operation that's the best fit for your workloads,
see
About GKE modes of operation .
Autopilot
In Cloud Shell, run the following command:
gcloud container clusters create-auto $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-ray-operator \
--machine-type = n1-standard-16 \
--location = $REGION
To communicate with your cluster, configure kubectl :
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = $ZONE
Standard
In Cloud Shell, create a Standard cluster that enables the
Ray operator add-on by running the following command:
gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME \
--addons = RayOperator \
--addons GcsFuseCsiDriver \
--machine-type = n1-standard-16 \
--workload-pool = $PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog \
--location = $ZONE
This command also enables the GcsFuseCsiDriver , which allows Pods to mount
Cloud Storage buckets as local file systems. The cluster creation might
take several minutes.
To communicate with your cluster, configure kubectl :
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION
Create a multi-host
TPU slice node pool:
gcloud container node-pools create v6e-16 \
--location = $ZONE \
--cluster = $CLUSTER_NAME \
--machine-type = ct6e-standard-4t \
--threads-per-core = 1 \
--tpu-topology = 4x4 \
--num-nodes = 4
GKE provisions a node pool consisting of four TPU Trillium (v6e)
VMs, which are configured together as a multi-host TPU slice, with a 4x4
topology, that's ready for distributed training workloads.
The
Ray operator -enabled
GKE cluster automatically installs KubeRay and the
KubeRay TPU webhook in your cluster.
Configure a Cloud Storage bucket and a service account
Create a Cloud Storage bucket for shared checkpoints between the
multi-host TPU nodes.
gsutil mb -p ${ PROJECT_ID } -c STANDARD -l ${ REGION } gs:// ${ GS_BUCKET }
To enable access to the Cloud Storage bucket, create a Kubernetes Service
Account:
kubectl create serviceaccount ${ KSA_NAME } --namespace ${ NAMESPACE }
To enable access to the Cloud Storage bucket, add the required
IAM policy bindings to the service account:
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// ${ GS_BUCKET } \
--member "principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/ ${ PROJECT_NUMBER } /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ ${ PROJECT_ID } .svc.id.goog/subject/ns/ ${ NAMESPACE } /sa/ ${ KSA_NAME } " \
--role "roles/storage.objectUser"
Create the training script
The following script uses Ray Train's JaxTrainer to run a distributed MaxText
training job. The script configures the training environment for a multi-host
TPU slice node pool and runs the MaxText training job on each worker node. The
train_loop_per_worker function wraps the MaxText main entry point, and uses
the Ray's distributed scheduler to execute the MaxText trainer on a multi-host
TPU slice.
Save the following Python script as maxtext_ray_trainer.py :
import os
from absl import app
import logging
from typing import Sequence
import ray
from ray.train.v2.api.config import ScalingConfig , RunConfig
from ray.train.v2.jax import JaxTrainer
def train_loop_per_worker ( config ):
from MaxText.train import main as maxtext_main
argv = config [ "argv" ]
maxtext_main ( argv )
def main ( argv : Sequence [ str ]):
trainer = JaxTrainer (
train_loop_per_worker = train_loop_per_worker ,
train_loop_config = { "argv" : argv },
scaling_config = ScalingConfig (
use_tpu = True ,
num_workers = 4 ,
topology = "4x4" ,
accelerator_type = "TPU-V6E" ,
resources_per_worker = { "TPU" : 4 },
placement_strategy = "SPREAD" ,
),
run_config = RunConfig (
name = "maxtext_jaxtrainer" ,
worker_runtime_env = {
"env_vars" : {
"JAX_PLATFORMS" : "tpu" ,
"ENABLE_PJRT_COMPATIBILITY" : "true" ,
"TPU_SLICE_BUILDER_DUMP_CHIP_FORCE" : "true" ,
"TPU_SLICE_BUILDER_DUMP_ICI" : "true" ,
"XLA_FLAGS" : "--xla_dump_to=/tmp/xla_dump_file --xla_dump_hlo_as_proto" ,
}
},
),
)
result = trainer . fit ()
logging . info ( "Training complete!" )
ray . shutdown ()
if __name__ == "__main__" :
app . run ( main )
To host the custom image, create an Artifact Registry repository:
gcloud artifacts repositories create ${ ARTIFACT_REGISTRY } \
--repository-format = docker --location = ${ REGION } && \
gcloud auth configure-docker ${ REGION } -docker.pkg.dev
To build an image that includes Ray and MaxText dependencies for training,
create a Dockerfile :
# Start from a Ray base image which includes JaxTrainer API.
# Maxtext with TPU requires Python 3.12.
FROM rayproject/ray:2.49.1-py312
USER root
RUN groupadd -r ray 2 >/dev/null || true && usermod -g ray ray
RUN sudo apt-get update -y \
&& sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y git \
&& sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
WORKDIR /app
# Clone the Maxtext repo and build from source, installing TPU dependencies.
RUN git clone https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext.git
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir uv
RUN cd maxtext && \
uv pip install --no-cache --system -e . [ tpu ] --resolution = lowest && \
install_maxtext_github_deps
# Copy the Ray Maxtext trainer to run on the remote container.
COPY maxtext_ray_trainer.py .
RUN chown -R ray:ray .
ENV PYTHONPATH = /app/maxtext/src:/app/maxtext:/app
USER ray
Note: This tutorial uses a custom image because the dependencies are too large to install them by using the Ray runtime_env command.
Build, tag, and push the Docker image to Artifact Registry:
export DOCKER_IMAGE = ${ REGION } -docker.pkg.dev/ ${ PROJECT_ID } / ${ ARTIFACT_REGISTRY } /ray-maxtext:latest
gcloud builds submit --tag ${ DOCKER_IMAGE }

The preceding RayCluster spec creates a TPU worker group with four workers
( numOfHosts: 4 ) per replica. Each worker requests four TPU chips
( google.com/tpu: "4" ). The workers will be scheduled on a node that runs
TPU Trillium ( tpu-v6e-slice ), and that's part of the same colocated
multi-host slice. KubeRay scales all four workers atomically, and the
required JAX environment variables, as well as Pod Affinities for
scheduling, are bootstrapped by GKE through a mutating
webhook.
To configure required values in the YAML file, create the RayCluster using
envsubst :
envsubst < maxtext-tpu-cluster.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
Verify the cluster is ready and running:
kubectl get rayclusters maxtext-tpu-cluster
The output should be similar to the following:
NAME DESIRED WORKERS AVAILABLE WORKERS CPUS MEMORY GPUS STATUS AGE
maxtext-tpu-cluster 4 4 40 798027216Ki 0 ready 11m
To access the Ray Dashboard through the Ray head service, establish a
port-forwarding session:
kubectl port-forward svc/maxtext-tpu-cluster-head-svc 8265 :8265 2>&1 >/dev/null &
Verify the RayCluster is reachable from your local environment:
ray list nodes --address http://localhost:8265
The output should be similar to the following:
======== List: 2025-09-13 03:53:16.988269 ========
Stats:
------------------------------
Total: 5
Table:
------------------------------

(...)
Submit the JaxTrainer script to the RayCluster and check that the RayJob completes successfully:
ray job submit \
--address http://localhost:8265 \
-- python /app/maxtext_ray_trainer.py \
/app/maxtext/src/MaxText/configs/base.yml \
base_output_directory = /data/ \
dataset_type = synthetic \
per_device_batch_size = 1 \
max_target_length = 4096 \
model_name = llama3-8b \
steps = 100 \
ici_fsdp_parallelism = 4 \
ici_tensor_parallelism = 4 \
run_name = rayjob-8b-4096-tp4-4x4
The preceding command submits the Python script, which calls the JaxTrainer
Ray code to the RayCluster. The ray job submit command includes some
MaxText-specific arguments to pass to the model configuration.
Note: It might take a couple of minutes for the script to complete.
In your terminal, you should
see output similar to the following:
(RayTrainWorker pid=21663, ip=10.12.3.6) completed step: 99, seconds: 1.100, TFLOP/s/device: 179.739, Tokens/s/device: 3725.218, total_weights: 65536, loss: 0.000 [repeated 3x across cluster]
------------------------------------------
Job 'raysubmit_zCrJcWnuymMQv4C3' succeeded
------------------------------------------
Success: You've completed training by using Ray Train's JaxTrainer and MaxText on
distributed multi-host TPU node pools.
