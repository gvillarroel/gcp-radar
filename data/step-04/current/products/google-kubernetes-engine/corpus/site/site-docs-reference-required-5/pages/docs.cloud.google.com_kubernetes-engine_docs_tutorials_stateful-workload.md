Autopilot
This tutorial shows how to deploy a simple reader/writer stateful workload using
a Persistent Volume (PV)
and a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Follow this tutorial to learn how to design for scalability
using Filestore , Google Cloud's managed
network filesystem.
Background
By nature, Pods are ephemeral. This means that GKE destroys the state and value stored in a Pod when it is deleted, evicted, or rescheduled.
As an application operator, you may want to maintain stateful workloads.
Examples of such workloads include applications that process WordPress articles,
messaging apps, and apps that process machine learning operations.
By using Filestore on GKE, you can perform the following operations:
Deploy stateful workloads that are scalable.
Enable multiple Pods to have ReadWriteMany as its accessMode , so that
multiple Pods can read and write at the same time to the same storage.
Set up GKE to mount volumes into multiple Pods simultaneously.
Persist storage when Pods are removed.
Enable Pods to share data and easily scale.
Objectives
This tutorial is for application operators and other users that want to set up a scalable stateful
workload on GKE using PVC and NFS.
This tutorial covers the following steps:
Create a GKE cluster.
Configure the managed file storage with Filestore using CSI.
Create a reader and a writer Pod.
Expose and access the reader Pod to a Service Load Balancer.
Scale up the writer.
Access data from the writer Pod.
Costs
This tutorial uses the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Filestore
GKE
Use the Pricing Calculator to
generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.
When you finish this tutorial, you can avoid continued billing by deleting the
resources you created. For more information, see Clean up .

Set defaults for the Google Cloud CLI
In the Google Cloud console, start a Cloud Shell instance:
Open Cloud Shell
Download the source code for this sample app:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/databases/stateful-workload-filestore
Set the default environment variables:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
gcloud config set compute/region COMPUTE_REGION
gcloud config set compute/zone COMPUTE_ZONE
gcloud config set filestore/zone COMPUTE_ZONE
gcloud config set filestore/region COMPUTE_REGION
Replace the following values:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID .
COMPUTE_REGION : the Compute Engine region .
COMPUTE_ZONE : the Compute Engine zone .
Create a GKE cluster
Create a GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters create-auto CLUSTER_NAME --location CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Replace the following value:
CLUSTER_NAME : your cluster name.
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION : the Compute Engine
location of the control plane of your
cluster. Provide a region for regional clusters, or a zone for zonal clusters.
Note: This step can take up to five minutes to complete.
The outcome is similar to the following once the cluster is created:
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME
NAME: CLUSTER_NAME
LOCATION: northamerica-northeast2
MASTER_VERSION: 1.21.11-gke.1100
MASTER_IP: 34.130.255.70
MACHINE_TYPE: e2-medium
NODE_VERSION: 1.21.11-gke.1100
NUM_NODES: 3
STATUS: RUNNING
Where the STATUS is RUNNING .
Configure the managed file storage with Filestore using CSI
GKE provides a way to automatically deploy and manage the Kubernetes Filestore CSI driver in your clusters.
Using Filestore CSI allows you to dynamically create or delete Filestore instances and use them in Kubernetes workloads with a StorageClass or a Deployment .
You can create a new Filestore instance by creating a PVC that dynamically provisions a Filestore instance and the PV, or access pre-provisioned Filestore instances in Kubernetes workloads.
Note: To use the Filestore CSI driver, your clusters must use GKE version 1.21 or later.
New instance
Create the Storage Class
apiVersion : storage.k8s.io/v1
kind : StorageClass
metadata :
name : filestore-sc
provisioner : filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
volumeBindingMode : WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion : true
parameters :
tier : standard
network : default
volumeBindingMode is set to WaitForFirstConsumer , which delays provisioning the volume until a Pod uses it. This setting allows the control plane to know the location of the volume (Kubernetes calls this its topology ), and lets this example work for new clusters with no nodes, where there is no topology yet.
tier is set to standard for faster Filestore instance creation time.
If you need higher available NFS storage, snapshots for data backup, data replication over multiple zones and other enterprise level features, set tier to enterprise instead.
Note: The reclaim policy for dynamically created PV defaults to Delete if the reclaimPolicy in the StorageClass is not set.
Create the StorageClass resource:
kubectl create -f filestore-storageclass.yaml
Verify that the Storage Class is created:
kubectl get sc
The output is similar to the following:
NAME PROVISIONER RECLAIMPOLICY VOLUMEBINDINGMODE ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION AGE
filestore-sc filestore.csi.storage.gke.io Delete Immediate true 94m
Pre-provisioned instance
Create the Storage Class
apiVersion : storage.k8s.io/v1
kind : StorageClass
metadata :
name : filestore-sc
provisioner : filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
volumeBindingMode : Immediate
allowVolumeExpansion : true
When volumeBindingMode is set to Immediate , it allows the provisioning of the volume to begin immediately.
Create the StorageClass resource:
kubectl create -f preprov-storageclass.yaml
Verify that the Storage Class is created:
kubectl get sc
The output is similar to the following:
NAME PROVISIONER RECLAIMPOLICY VOLUMEBINDINGMODE ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION AGE
filestore-sc filestore.csi.storage.gke.io Delete Immediate true 94m
Create a Persistent Volume for the Filestore instance
apiVersion : v1
kind : PersistentVolume
metadata :
name : fileserver
annotations :
pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by : filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
spec :
storageClassName : filestore-sc
capacity :
storage : 1Ti
accessModes :
- ReadWriteMany
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy : Delete
volumeMode : Filesystem
csi :
driver : filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
# Modify this to use the zone, filestore instance and share name.
volumeHandle : "modeInstance/<LOCATION>/<INSTANCE_NAME>/<FILE_SHARE_NAME>"
volumeAttributes :
ip : < IP_ADDRESS > # Modify this to Pre-provisioned Filestore instance IP
volume : < FILE_SHARE_NAME > # Modify this to Pre-provisioned Filestore instance share name
Verify that the pre-existing Filestore instance is ready:
gcloud filestore instances list
The output is similar to the following, where the STATE value is READY :
INSTANCE_NAME: stateful-filestore
LOCATION: us-central1-a
TIER: ENTERPRISE
CAPACITY_GB: 1024
FILE_SHARE_NAME: statefulpath
IP_ADDRESS: 10.109.38.98
STATE: READY
CREATE_TIME: 2022-04-05T18:58:28
Note the INSTANCE_NAME , LOCATION , FILE_SHARE_NAME , and IP_ADDRESS of the Filestore instance.
Populate the Filestore instance console variables:
INSTANCE_NAME = INSTANCE_NAME
LOCATION = LOCATION
FILE_SHARE_NAME = FILE_SHARE_NAME
IP_ADDRESS = IP_ADDRESS
Replace the placeholder variables with the console variables obtained above to the file preprov-pv.yaml :
sed "s/<INSTANCE_NAME>/ $INSTANCE_NAME /" preprov-pv.yaml > changed.yaml && mv changed.yaml preprov-pv.yaml
sed "s/<LOCATION>/ $LOCATION /" preprov-pv.yaml > changed.yaml && mv changed.yaml preprov-pv.yaml
sed "s/<FILE_SHARE_NAME>/ $FILE_SHARE_NAME /" preprov-pv.yaml > changed.yaml && mv changed.yaml preprov-pv.yaml
sed "s/<IP_ADDRESS>/ $IP_ADDRESS /" preprov-pv.yaml > changed.yaml && mv changed.yaml preprov-pv.yaml
Create the PV
kubectl apply -f preprov-pv.yaml
Verify that the PV's STATUS is set to Bound :
kubectl get pv
The output is similar to the following:
NAME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES RECLAIM POLICY STATUS CLAIM STORAGECLASS REASON AGE
fileserver 1Ti RWX Delete Bound default/fileserver filestore-sc 46m
Use a PersistentVolumeClaim to access the volume
The following pvc.yaml manifest references the Filestore CSI driver's StorageClass named filestore-sc .
In order to have multiple Pods reading and writing to the volume,
the accessMode is set to ReadWriteMany .
kind : PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion : v1
metadata :
name : fileserver
spec :
accessModes :
- ReadWriteMany
storageClassName : filestore-sc
resources :
requests :
storage : 1Ti
Deploy the PVC:
kubectl create -f pvc.yaml
Verify that the PVC is created:
kubectl get pvc
The output is similar to the following:
NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE
fileserver Bound pvc-aadc7546-78dd-4f12-a909-7f02aaedf0c3 1Ti RWX filestore-sc 92m
Note: the filestore instance won't be created until it is used by a Pod in the next step.
Create a reader and a writer Pod
In this section, you create a reader Pod and a writer Pod. This tutorial uses
Kubernetes Deployments to create the Pods. A Deployment is a Kubernetes API object that lets you run multiple replicas of Pods that are distributed among the nodes in a cluster..
Create the reader Pod
The reader Pod will read the file that is being written by the writers Pods.
The reader Pods will see what time and which writer Pod replica wrote to the file.
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : reader
spec :
replicas : 1
selector :
matchLabels :
app : reader
template :
metadata :
labels :
app : reader
spec :
containers :
- name : nginx
image : nginx:stable-alpine
ports :
- containerPort : 80
volumeMounts :
- name : fileserver
mountPath : /usr/share/nginx/html # the shared directory
readOnly : true
volumes :
- name : fileserver
persistentVolumeClaim :
claimName : fileserver
The reader Pod will read from the path /usr/share/nginx/html which is shared between all the Pods.
Deploy the reader Pod:
kubectl apply -f reader-fs.yaml
Verify that the newly created Filestore instance is ready:
gcloud filestore instances list
The output is similar to the following:
INSTANCE_NAME: pvc-5bc55493-9e58-4ca5-8cd2-0739e0a7b68c
LOCATION: northamerica-northeast2-a
TIER: STANDARD
CAPACITY_GB: 1024
FILE_SHARE_NAME: vol1
IP_ADDRESS: 10.29.174.90
STATE: READY
CREATE_TIME: 2022-06-24T18:29:19
Verify that the reader replicas are running by querying the list of Pods:
kubectl get pods
The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
reader-66b8fff8fd-jb9p4 1/1 Running 0 3m30s
Note: The Filestore instance can take five minutes to create. The reader pod won't start running until the Filestore instance is created. Proceed to the next step while waiting.
Create the writer Pod
The writer Pod will periodically write to a shared file that other writer and reader Pods can access. The writer Pod records its presence by writing its host name to the shared file.
The image used for the writer Pod is a custom image of Alpine Linux, which is used for utilities and production applications. It includes a
script indexInfo.html that will obtain the metadata of the most recent writer,
and keep count of all the unique writers and total writes.
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : writer
spec :
replicas : 2 # start with 2 replicas
selector :
matchLabels :
app : writer
template :
metadata :
labels :
app : writer
spec :
containers :
- name : content
image : us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/stateful-workload:latest
volumeMounts :
- name : fileserver
mountPath : /html # the shared directory
command : [ "/bin/sh" , "-c" ]
args :
- cp /htmlTemp/indexInfo.html /html/index.html;
while true; do
echo "<b> Date :</b> <text>$(date)</text> <b> Writer :</b> <text2> ${HOSTNAME} </text2> <br> " >> /html/indexData.html;
sleep 30;
done
volumes :
- name : fileserver
persistentVolumeClaim :
claimName : fileserver
For this tutorial, the writer Pod writes every 30 seconds to the path /html/index.html . Modify the sleep number
value to have a different write frequency.
Deploy the writer Pod:
kubectl apply -f writer-fs.yaml
Verify that the writer Pods are running by querying the list of Pods:
kubectl get pods
The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
reader-66b8fff8fd-jb9p4 1/1 Running 0 3m30s
writer-855565fbc6-8gh2k 1/1 Running 0 2m31s
writer-855565fbc6-lls4r 1/1 Running 0 2m31s
Note: Pod creation might take up to five minutes.
Expose and access the reader workload to a Service Load Balancer
To expose a workload outside the cluster, create a Service of type
LoadBalancer . This type of Service creates an external load balancer with an IP address reachable through the internet.
Create a Service of type LoadBalancer named reader-lb :
kubectl create -f loadbalancer.yaml
Watch the deployment to see that GKE assigns an EXTERNAL-IP for reader-lb Service:
kubectl get svc --watch
When the Service is ready, the EXTERNAL-IP column displays the public IP
address of the load balancer:
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
kubernetes ClusterIP 10.8.128.1 <none> 443/TCP 2d21h
reader-lb LoadBalancer 10.8.131.79 34.71.232.122 80:32672/TCP 2d20h
Press Ctrl+C to terminate the watch process.
Use a web browser to navigate to the EXTERNAL-IP assigned to the load balancer. The page refreshes every 30 seconds.
The more writers Pods and shorter the frequency, the more entries it will show.
To see more details about the load balancer service, see loadbalancer.yaml .
Scale up the writer
Because the PV accessMode was set to ReadWriteMany , GKE can scale up the number of Pods so that more writer Pods can write to this shared volume (or more readers can read to read them).
Scale up the writer to five replicas:
kubectl scale deployment writer --replicas = 5
The output is similar to the following:
deployment.extensions/writer scaled
Note: Scaling might take a few minutes while the cluster is allocating more resources.
Verify the number of running replicas:
kubectl get pods
The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
reader-66b8fff8fd-jb9p4 1/1 Running 0 11m
writer-855565fbc6-8dfkj 1/1 Running 0 4m
writer-855565fbc6-8gh2k 1/1 Running 0 10m
writer-855565fbc6-gv5rs 1/1 Running 0 4m
writer-855565fbc6-lls4r 1/1 Running 0 10m
writer-855565fbc6-tqwxc 1/1 Running 0 4m
Use a web browser to navigate again to the EXTERNAL-IP assigned to the load balancer.
At this point, you configured and scaled your cluster to support five stateful writer Pods. Where multiple writer Pods are writing to the same file simultaneously. The reader Pods can also be easily scaled up.
Optional: Access data from the writer Pod
This section demonstrates how to use a command-line interface to access a reader or writer Pod. You can see the
shared component that the writer is writing to and the reader is reading from.
Obtain the writer Pod name:
kubectl get pods
The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
writer-5465d65b46-7hxv4 1/1 Running 0 20d
Note the hostname of a writer Pod (Example: writer-5465d65b46-7hxv4 ).
Run the following command to access the writer Pod:
kubectl exec -it WRITER_HOSTNAME -- /bin/sh
See the shared component in the file indexData.html :
cd /html
cat indexData.html
Clear the indexData.html file:
echo '' > indexData.html
Refresh the web browser hosting the EXTERNAL-IP address to see the change.
Exit the environment:
exit
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Delete the individual resources
Delete the load balancer Service:
kubectl delete service reader-lb
Wait until the load balancer provisioned for the reader service is deleted
Verify the list returns Listed 0 items :
gcloud compute forwarding-rules list
Delete the Deployments
kubectl delete deployment writer
kubectl delete deployment reader
Verify the Pods are deleted and returns No resources found in default namespace.
kubectl get pods
Delete the PVC. This will also delete the PV and the Filestore instance due to the retention policy set to delete
kubectl delete pvc fileserver
Delete the GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete CLUSTER_NAME --location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
This deletes the resources that make up the GKE cluster, including the reader and writer Pods.
