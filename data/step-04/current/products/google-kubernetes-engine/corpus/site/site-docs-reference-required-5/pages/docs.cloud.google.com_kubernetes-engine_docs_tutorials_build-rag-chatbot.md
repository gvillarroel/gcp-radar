Build a RAG chatbot with GKE and Cloud Storage
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Autopilot
Standard
This tutorial shows you how to integrate a large language model (LLM)
application based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with PDF files that
you upload to a Cloud Storage bucket.
This guide uses a database as a storage and semantic search engine that holds the
representations (embeddings) of the uploaded documents. You use the
Langchain framework to interact with the
embeddings and you use Gemini models available through
Vertex AI.
Langchain is a popular open-source Python framework that simplifies many
machine learning tasks and has interfaces to integrate with different vector
databases and AI services.
This tutorial is intended for cloud platform
administrators and architects ,
ML engineers ,
and MLOps (DevOps) professionals interested in deploying RAG LLM applications
to GKE and Cloud Storage.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Build and deploy an application to create and store document embeddings in a
vector database.
Automate the application to trigger new document uploads to a
Cloud Storage bucket.
Deploy a chatbot application that uses semantic search to answer questions
based on the document content.
Deployment architecture
In this tutorial, you create a Cloud Storage bucket, an
Eventarc trigger, and the following Services:
embed-docs : Eventarc triggers this Service every time a user
uploads a new document to the Cloud Storage bucket. The Service
starts a
Kubernetes Job
which creates embeddings for the uploaded document and inserts the embeddings
into a vector database.
chatbot : This Service answers natural language questions about the uploaded
documents using semantic search and the
Gemini API .
The following diagram shows the process of uploading and vectorizing documents:
In the diagram, the user uploads files into the Cloud Storage bucket.
Eventarc subscribes to object metadataUpdated events for the
bucket and uses Eventarc's event forwarder, which is a Kubernetes
workload, to call the embed-docs Service when you upload a new document. The
Service then creates embeddings for the uploaded document. The embed-docs
Service stores the embeddings in a vector database using the Vertex AI
embedding model.
The following diagram shows the process of asking questions about the uploaded
document content using the chatbot Service:
Users can ask questions using natural language, and the chatbot generates
answers based solely on the content of the uploaded files. The chatbot retrieves
context from the vector database using semantic search, then sends the question
and context to Gemini.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
Cloud Storage
Cloud Build
Eventarc
Artifact Registry
Vertex AI
Pub/Sub

When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell
to run commands. Cloud Shell is a shell environment for managing
resources hosted on Google Cloud. Cloud Shell comes
preinstalled with the
Google Cloud CLI ,
kubectl , and
Terraform command-line tools. If you don't use
Cloud Shell, install the Google Cloud CLI.
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Vertex AI, Cloud Build, Eventarc, Artifact Registry APIs:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com eventarc.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com

Set up your environment
Set up your environment with Cloud Shell:
Set environment variables for your project:
Qdrant
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX = qdrant
export CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION = us-central1
export REGION = us-central1
export DB_NAMESPACE = qdrant
Replace PROJECT_ID with your
Google Cloud project ID.
Elasticsearch
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX = elasticsearch
export CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION = us-central1
export REGION = us-central1
export DB_NAMESPACE = elastic
Replace PROJECT_ID with your
Google Cloud project ID.
PGVector
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX = postgres
export CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION = us-central1
export REGION = us-central1
export DB_NAMESPACE = pg-ns
Replace PROJECT_ID with your
Google Cloud project ID.
Weaviate
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX = weaviate
export CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION = us-central1
export REGION = us-central1
export DB_NAMESPACE = weaviate
Replace PROJECT_ID with your
Google Cloud project ID.
Verify that your GKE cluster is running:
gcloud container clusters list --project = ${ PROJECT_ID } --location = ${ CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION }
The output is similar to the following:
NAME LOCATION MASTER_VERSION MASTER_IP MACHINE_TYPE NODE_VERSION NUM_NODES STATUS
[KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX]-cluster us-central1 1.30.1-gke.1329003 <EXTERNAL IP> e2-standard-2 1.30.1-gke.1329003 6 RUNNING
Clone the sample code repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
Navigate to the databases directory:
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/databases
Prepare your infrastructure
Create an Artifact Registry repository, build Docker images, and push Docker images to
Artifact Registry:
Create an Artifact Registry repository:
gcloud artifacts repositories create ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -images \
--repository-format = docker \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--description = "Vector database images repository" \
--async
Set the storage.objectAdmin and artifactregistry.admin permissions on the
Compute Engine service account to use Cloud Build
to build and push Docker images for the embed-docs and chatbot Services.
export PROJECT_NUMBER = PROJECT_NUMBER
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--member = "serviceAccount: ${ PROJECT_NUMBER } -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/storage.objectAdmin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--member = "serviceAccount: ${ PROJECT_NUMBER } -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = "roles/artifactregistry.admin"
Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with your
Google Cloud project number.
Build Docker images for the embed-docs and chatbot Services. The embed-docs
image contains Python code for both the application that
receives Eventarc forwarder requests and the embedding job.
Qdrant
export DOCKER_REPO = " ${ REGION } -docker.pkg.dev/ ${ PROJECT_ID } / ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -images"
gcloud builds submit qdrant/docker/chatbot --region = ${ REGION } \
--tag ${ DOCKER_REPO } /chatbot:1.0 --async
gcloud builds submit qdrant/docker/embed-docs --region = ${ REGION } \
--tag ${ DOCKER_REPO } /embed-docs:1.0 --async
Elasticsearch
export DOCKER_REPO = " ${ REGION } -docker.pkg.dev/ ${ PROJECT_ID } / ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -images"
gcloud builds submit elasticsearch/docker/chatbot --region = ${ REGION } \
--tag ${ DOCKER_REPO } /chatbot:1.0 --async
gcloud builds submit elasticsearch/docker/embed-docs --region = ${ REGION } \
--tag ${ DOCKER_REPO } /embed-docs:1.0 --async
PGVector
export DOCKER_REPO = " ${ REGION } -docker.pkg.dev/ ${ PROJECT_ID } / ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -images"
gcloud builds submit postgres-pgvector/docker/chatbot --region = ${ REGION } \
--tag ${ DOCKER_REPO } /chatbot:1.0 --async
gcloud builds submit postgres-pgvector/docker/embed-docs --region = ${ REGION } \
--tag ${ DOCKER_REPO } /embed-docs:1.0 --async
Weaviate
export DOCKER_REPO = " ${ REGION } -docker.pkg.dev/ ${ PROJECT_ID } / ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -images"
gcloud builds submit weaviate/docker/chatbot --region = ${ REGION } \
--tag ${ DOCKER_REPO } /chatbot:1.0 --async
gcloud builds submit weaviate/docker/embed-docs --region = ${ REGION } \
--tag ${ DOCKER_REPO } /embed-docs:1.0 --async
Verify the images:
gcloud artifacts docker images list $DOCKER_REPO \
--project = $PROJECT_ID \
--format = "value(IMAGE)"
The output is similar to the following:
$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX}-images/chatbot
$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/${KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX}-images/embed-docs
Deploy a
Kubernetes Service Account
with permissions to run Kubernetes Jobs:
Qdrant
sed "s/<PROJECT_ID>/ $PROJECT_ID /;s/<CLUSTER_PREFIX>/ $KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX /" qdrant/manifests/05-rag/service-account.yaml | kubectl -n qdrant apply -f -
Elasticsearch
sed "s/<PROJECT_ID>/ $PROJECT_ID /;s/<CLUSTER_PREFIX>/ $KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX /" elasticsearch/manifests/05-rag/service-account.yaml | kubectl -n elastic apply -f -
PGVector
sed "s/<PROJECT_ID>/ $PROJECT_ID /;s/<CLUSTER_PREFIX>/ $KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX /" postgres-pgvector/manifests/03-rag/service-account.yaml | kubectl -n pg-ns apply -f -
Weaviate
sed "s/<PROJECT_ID>/ $PROJECT_ID /;s/<CLUSTER_PREFIX>/ $KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX /" weaviate/manifests/04-rag/service-account.yaml | kubectl -n weaviate apply -f -
When using Terraform to create the GKE cluster and have create_service_account
set as true, a separate service account will be created and used by the cluster
and nodes.
Grant artifactregistry.serviceAgent role to this Compute Engine
service account to allow the nodes to pull image from the Artifact Registry
created for embed-docs and chatbot .
export CLUSTER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT = $( gcloud container clusters describe ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster \
--location = ${ CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION } \
--format = "value(nodeConfig.serviceAccount)" )
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${ PROJECT_ID } \
--member = "serviceAccount: ${ CLUSTER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT } " \
--role = "roles/artifactregistry.serviceAgent"
Without granting access to the service account, your nodes might experience
permission issue when trying to pull image from the Artifact Registry when
deploying the embed-docs and chatbot Services.
Deploy a Kubernetes Deployment for the embed-docs and chatbot Services.
A Deployment is a Kubernetes API object that lets you run multiple replicas of Pods that are distributed among the nodes in a cluster.:
Qdrant
sed "s|<DOCKER_REPO>| $DOCKER_REPO |" qdrant/manifests/05-rag/chatbot.yaml | kubectl -n qdrant apply -f -
sed "s|<DOCKER_REPO>| $DOCKER_REPO |" qdrant/manifests/05-rag/docs-embedder.yaml | kubectl -n qdrant apply -f -
Elasticsearch
sed "s|<DOCKER_REPO>| $DOCKER_REPO |" elasticsearch/manifests/05-rag/chatbot.yaml | kubectl -n elastic apply -f -
sed "s|<DOCKER_REPO>| $DOCKER_REPO |" elasticsearch/manifests/05-rag/docs-embedder.yaml | kubectl -n elastic apply -f -
PGVector
sed "s|<DOCKER_REPO>| $DOCKER_REPO |" postgres-pgvector/manifests/03-rag/chatbot.yaml | kubectl -n pg-ns apply -f -
sed "s|<DOCKER_REPO>| $DOCKER_REPO |" postgres-pgvector/manifests/03-rag/docs-embedder.yaml | kubectl -n pg-ns apply -f -
Weaviate
sed "s|<DOCKER_REPO>| $DOCKER_REPO |" weaviate/manifests/04-rag/chatbot.yaml | kubectl -n weaviate apply -f -
sed "s|<DOCKER_REPO>| $DOCKER_REPO |" weaviate/manifests/04-rag/docs-embedder.yaml | kubectl -n weaviate apply -f -
Enable Eventarc triggers for GKE:
gcloud eventarc gke-destinations init
When prompted, enter y .
Deploy the Cloud Storage bucket and create an
Eventarc trigger using Terraform:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = vector-database/terraform/cloud-storage init
terraform -chdir = vector-database/terraform/cloud-storage apply \
-var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } \
-var db_namespace = ${ DB_NAMESPACE }
When prompted, type yes . It might take several minutes for the command
to complete.
Terraform creates the following resources:
A Cloud Storage bucket to upload the documents
An Eventarc trigger
A Google Cloud Service Account named service_account_eventarc_name
with permission to use Eventarc.
A Google Cloud Service Account named service_account_bucket_name
with permission to read the bucket and access Vertex AI
models.
The output is similar to the following:
... # Several lines of output omitted
Apply complete! Resources: 15 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
... # Several lines of output omitted
Load documents and run chatbot queries
Upload the demo documents and run queries to search over the demo documents
using the chatbot:
Upload the example carbon-free-energy.pdf document to your bucket:
gcloud storage cp vector-database/documents/carbon-free-energy.pdf gs:// ${ PROJECT_ID } - ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -training-docs
Verify the document embedder job completed successfully:
kubectl get job -n ${ DB_NAMESPACE }
The output is similar to the following:
NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE
docs-embedder1716570453361446 1/1 32s 71s
Get the external IP address of the load balancer:
export EXTERNAL_IP = $( kubectl -n ${ DB_NAMESPACE } get svc chatbot --output jsonpath = '{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}' )
echo http:// ${ EXTERNAL_IP } :80
Open the external IP address in your web browser:
http:// EXTERNAL_IP
The chatbot responds with a message similar to the following:
How can I help you?
Ask questions about the content of the uploaded documents. If the chatbot
cannot find anything, it answers I don't know . For example, you could
ask the following:
You: Hi, what are Google plans for the future?
An example output from the chatbot is similar to the following:
Bot: Google intends to run on carbon-free energy everywhere, at all times by 2030. To achieve this, it will rely on a combination of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, and carbon-free technologies, such as battery storage.
Ask the chatbot a question that is out of context of the uploaded document.
For example, you could ask the following:
You: What are Google plans to colonize Mars?
An example output from the chatbot is similar to the following:
Bot: I don't know. The provided context does not mention anything about Google's plans to colonize Mars.
About the application code
This section explains how the application code works. There are three scripts
inside the Docker images:
endpoint.py : receives Eventarc events on each document
upload and starts the Kubernetes Jobs to process them.
embedding-job.py : downloads documents from the bucket, creates embeddings,
and insert embeddings into the vector database.
chat.py : runs queries over the content of stored documents.
The diagram shows the process of generating answers using the documents data:
In the diagram, the application loads a PDF file, splits the file into chunks,
then vectors, then sends the vectors to a vector database. Later, a user asks
a question to the chatbot. The RAG chain uses semantic search to search the
vector database, then returns the context along with the question to the LLM.
The LLM answers the question, and stores the question into chat history.
About endpoint.py
This file processes messages from Eventarc, creates a Kubernetes
Job for embedding the document, and accepts request from anywhere on port 5001

Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
The easiest way to avoid billing is to delete the project you created for
this tutorial.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
If you deleted the project, your clean up is complete. If you didn't delete the
project, proceed to delete the individual resources.
Delete individual resources
Delete the Artifact Registry repository:
gcloud artifacts repositories delete ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -images \
--location = ${ REGION } \
--async
When prompted, type y .
Delete the Cloud Storage bucket and the Eventarc
trigger:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = vector-database/terraform/cloud-storage destroy \
-var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } \
-var db_namespace = ${ DB_NAMESPACE }
When prompted, type yes .
Eventarc requires that you have a valid endpoint target both
during creation and during deletion.
