Standard
This tutorial shows how to customize the nodes of a
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
cluster by using
DaemonSets .
A DaemonSet helps ensure that all (or selected) nodes run a copy of a
Pod .
When new nodes are added to a cluster, they also run a Pod from the DaemonSet.
If the tools and systems you use to initialize your clusters are different from
the tools and systems you use to run your workloads, you increase the effort it
takes to manage your environment. For example, if you use a configuration
management tool to initialize the cluster nodes, you're relying on a procedure
that's outside the runtime environment where the rest of your workloads run.
Using a DaemonSet lets you use the same tools to orchestrate your workloads that
you use to
modify your GKE nodes .
The goal of this tutorial is to help system administrators, system engineers, or
infrastructure operators streamline the initialization of Kubernetes clusters.
Caution: Customizing your GKE nodes can lead to unintended
behavior that might negatively affect the health of your workloads and nodes.
Not all customizations are supported. Ensure that you implement extensive
testing of any customizations before deploying them on clusters running
production workloads. This tutorial uses a privileged container, which has
security implications that you must review and understand.
Before reading this page, ensure that you're familiar with:
Kubernetes
GKE
Docker
chroot
In this tutorial, you learn to use Kubernetes taints and tolerations to help ensure
that nodes are configured by a DaemonSet before application workloads can be scheduled
on them.
Objectives
In this tutorial you do the following:
Provision a GKE cluster.
Taint a node pool to prevent workload scheduling before applying the node configuration.
Deploy a DaemonSet that configures nodes and removes the taint.
Verify that cluster nodes are configured and the taint is removed.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

Privileged DaemonSet security implications
Using the securityContext: privileged: true setting in a DaemonSet (or any Pod) is
powerful but comes with significant security implications because it disables
most container isolation boundaries for that Pod. You should be aware of the
following security restrictions and risks that it introduces:
Container escape or host compromise: a vulnerability within the
privileged container application or image can directly lead to root access
on the host node.
Violation of least privilege: privileged mode grants all capabilities,
likely far more than needed for a specific task. This broad access increases
the potential damage if the container is compromised.
Node destabilization: accidental or malicious commands could run within the
privileged container, for example incorrect sysctl values or commands like rm -rf /host/boot .
These types of commands can crash or corrupt the host node operating system.
Lateral movement: compromising one node through a privileged DaemonSet gives
an attacker a strong foothold to attack other nodes, the Kubernetes control
plane, or connected systems.
Data exposure: unrestricted access to the host file system ( / ) can
expose sensitive data stored on the node, including credentials, keys, or
data belonging to other Pods if they use hostPath volumes.
Increased attack surface: privileged mode exposes more of the host
kernel system calls and features to potential exploits from within the
container.
To avoid security risks, you should be aware of the following best practices and mitigations:
Avoid using the privileged mode: the most secure approach is to avoid the privileged:
true setting entirely.
Use Linux capabilities: if elevated rights are needed, you can grant
specific Linux capabilities such as NET_ADMIN , SYS_ADMIN , SYS_MODULE
in the securityContext.capabilities.add field instead of full privilege.
This approach follows the principle of least privilege, which we recommend
over granting broad permissions.
Limit scope: run privileged DaemonSets only on dedicated, possibly
tainted, node pools to contain the potential impact if a container is
compromised.
Enforce policies: use tools like Policy Controller or
Gatekeeper to create policies that restrict, audit, or require justification
for deploying privileged containers.
Scan and use trusted images: use Binary Authorization and rigorous image
scanning to help ensure only vetted, trusted container images are run with
elevated privileges.
Minimize host mounts: only mount the specific host paths needed, and use
readOnly: true whenever possible. Avoid mounting the entire root file
system ( / ).
Perform regular audits: periodically review all workloads running with
the privileged: true setting.
Bootstrap the environment
In this section, you do the following:
Enable the necessary
Cloud APIs .
Provision a
service account
with limited privileges for the nodes in the GKE cluster.
Prepare the GKE cluster.
Grant the user cluster administration privileges.
Enable Cloud APIs
Open Cloud Shell.
OPEN Cloud Shell
Select the Google Cloud project:
gcloud config set project project-id
Replace project-id with the ID of the
Google Cloud project that you created or selected for this tutorial.
Enable the Kubernetes Engine API:
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
Provision a service account to manage GKE clusters
In this section, you create a
service account
that is associated with the nodes in the cluster. In this tutorial,
GKE nodes use this service account instead of the default service
account. As a best practice,
grant the service account just the roles and access permissions that are required
to run the application.
The roles required for the service account are as follows:
Monitoring Viewer role ( roles/monitoring.viewer ). This role gives
read-only access to monitoring data.
Monitoring Metric Writer role ( roles/monitoring.metricWriter ). This
role permits writing monitoring data.
Logs Writer role ( roles/logging.logWriter ). This role gives
permissions to write logs.
To provision a service account, follow these steps:
In Cloud Shell, initialize an environment variable that stores
the service account name:
GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME = ds-init-tutorial-gke
Create a service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts create " $GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME " \
--display-name = " $GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME "
Initialize an environment variable that stores the service account
email account name:
GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL = " $( gcloud iam service-accounts list \
--format = 'value(email)' \
--filter = displayName: " $GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME " ) "
Bind the Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to the service account:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding \
" $( gcloud config get-value project 2 > /dev/null ) " \
--member serviceAccount: " $GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL " \
--role roles/monitoring.viewer
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding \
" $( gcloud config get-value project 2 > /dev/null ) " \
--member serviceAccount: " $GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL " \
--role roles/monitoring.metricWriter
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding \
" $( gcloud config get-value project 2 > /dev/null ) " \
--member serviceAccount: " $GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL " \
--role roles/logging.logWriter
Prepare the GKE cluster
In this section, you launch the GKE cluster, grant permissions,
and finish the cluster configuration.
For this tutorial, a cluster with a relatively low number of small,
general purpose
nodes is enough to demonstrate the concept of this tutorial. You create a
cluster with
one node pool
(the default one).
In Cloud Shell, create and launch a
regional
GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters create ds-init-tutorial \
--enable-ip-alias \
--machine-type = n1-standard-2 \
--metadata disable-legacy-endpoints = true \
--node-labels = app = default-init \
--node-locations us-central1-a,us-central1-b,us-central1-c \
--no-enable-basic-auth \
--no-issue-client-certificate \
--num-nodes = 1 \
--location us-central1 \
--service-account = " $GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL "
Apply node configurations using a DaemonSet
In this section, you prevent workloads from running on nodes before configuration is complete by applying a taint to the node pool. Then you deploy a DaemonSet that does the following:
Schedules Pods on tainted nodes by using a toleration for the taint.
Runs a privileged init container that first applies the node configuration using sysctl , and then removes the taint from the node using kubectl . Removing the taint makes the node schedulable for workloads.
Schedules and runs a pause container that stays idle and consumes no resources to prevent the DaemonSet from rescheduling the Pod used for configuration.
This tutorial applies the vm.max_map_count=262144 kernel parameter as an example configuration.
Apply a taint to the default node pool:
gcloud container node-pools update default-pool \
--cluster = ds-init-tutorial \
--node-taints = node.config.status/stage = configuring:NoSchedule \
--region = us-central1
With this taint, only Pods that tolerate it, like the DaemonSet Pod, can be scheduled in this node pool.
Verify that the taint is applied:
kubectl describe nodes -l cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool = default-pool | grep Taints
The node status should show node.config.status/stage=configuring:NoSchedule .
Save the following manifest as auto-untaint-daemonset.yaml :
# WARNING: This DaemonSet runs as privileged, which has significant
# security implications. Only use this on clusters where you have
# strict controls over what is deployed.

This manifest creates a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, and ClusterRoleBinding to
grant the DaemonSet permission to remove taints from nodes. The DaemonSet
deploys a Pod to each node that tolerates the configuring:NoSchedule taint.
This Pod runs a privileged init container that applies the sysctl
configuration ( vm.max_map_count=262144 ) and removes the node taint, which makes the
node schedulable. A pause container then starts to keep the Pod running.
The init container runs in privileged mode, which has security implications.
For more details, see Privileged DaemonSet tradeoffs and security
restrictions .
Apply the manifest:
kubectl apply -f auto-untaint-daemonset.yaml
Verify that the DaemonSet Pods are created and wait for them to reach the Running state:
kubectl get pods -l app = auto-untaint-configurator -o wide
The Running state indicates that the init container has completed successfully.
Make a note of the Pod name so you can use it to verify the initialization
in the next section.
Validate and verify the initialization procedure
After node configuration is complete, you can verify the results by checking the logs.
Check the init container logs of one of the Pods to see its output:
kubectl logs POD_NAME -c configure-and-untaint
Replace POD_NAME with the name of your Pod.
You should see output indicating successful configuration and node untainting.
Verify that the taint is removed:
kubectl describe nodes -l cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool = default-pool | grep Taints
The node status should show Taints: <none> , or show taints that have the key node.config.status/stage .
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used
in this tutorial, you could delete the project you created for this tutorial. If
you created a project dedicated to this tutorial, you can
delete it entirely .
If you used an existing project but don't want to delete it, use the following
steps for
cleaning up the project .
Clean up the project
To clean up a project without deleting it, you need to remove the resources
that you created in this tutorial.
In Cloud Shell, delete the GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete ds-init-tutorial --quiet --region us-central1
Delete the service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts delete " $GKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL " --quiet
Delete the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project you created for
the tutorial.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
