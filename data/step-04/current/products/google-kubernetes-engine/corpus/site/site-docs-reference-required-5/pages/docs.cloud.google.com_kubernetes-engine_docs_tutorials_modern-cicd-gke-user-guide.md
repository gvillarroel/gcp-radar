Standard
This document describes a framework for implementing modern continuous
integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes on a multi-team software
delivery platform that uses
Google Kubernetes Engine .
You can then iterate on the platform to further improve performance for
development and operations, including release velocity, platform reliability,
and recovery time from failures.
This document is part of a series:
Modern CI/CD with GKE: A software delivery framework
(this document)
Modern CI/CD with GKE: Build a CI/CD system (reference architecture)
Modern CI/CD with GKE: Apply the developer workflow
This document is intended for enterprise architects and application
developers, as well as IT security, DevOps, and Site Reliability
Engineering teams. Some experience with automated deployment tools and
processes is useful for understanding the concepts in this document.
A case for modern CI/CD
CI/CD is a software development approach that lets you automate the build, test,
and deployment phases of software development by using a number of tools and
repeatable processes.
In addition to CI/CD automation, Kubernetes and containers have enabled
enterprises to achieve unprecedented improvements in the speed of development
and deployment. Yet, even as Kubernetes and container adoption grows, many
organizations don't fully realize the benefits in release velocity, stability,
and operational efficiencies because their CI/CD practices don't take full
advantage of Kubernetes or address operations and security concerns.
A truly modern CI/CD approach needs to encompass more than just automation. To
fully realize improvements in speed and security, and to use the power of
Kubernetes and containers, you need to streamline your application onboarding,
CI/CD practices, and operational processes.
Using the consistent infrastructure offered by the GKE
platform, uniform CI/CD methods, and best practices in implementation, your
organization can gain the following benefits for development and operations:
Reducing lead time for changes.
Let operations and security teams create and update best
practices for provisioning applications and provisioning policy across
the platform.
Simplify application onboarding by giving teams fully
functioning and deployable starter projects that have your
organization's best practices built in.
Decreasing the time required to restore service.
Manage all configuration declaratively using GitOps for
simplified audit, rollback, and review.
Standardize deployment and monitoring methodologies across the
organization to decrease the time it takes to identify the contributing
factors of a service-impacting issue.
Increasing deployment frequency.
Ensure that application developers can iterate independently in
their own development sandboxes (or landing zones ) without
interfering with each other.
Use GitOps for deployment, improved release management, and
change tracking.
Implement guard rails so that service teams are empowered to
deploy frequently.
Create a progressive rollout process for deploying consistently
across pre-production environments, giving developers the confidence
they need to deploy changes to production.
To see how these benefits and concepts are realized with GKE
and CI/CD, see the other documents in this series:
Modern CI/CD with GKE: Building a CI/CD system
Modern CI/CD with GKE: Applying the developer workflow
Assess readiness for a modern approach
Before you implement modern CI/CD tools and processes with
GKE, you need to assess whether your organization and teams
are ready to adopt a new platform.
Organizational traits
Adopting a modern platform requires the following support from your business
leadership and technical teams:
Leadership sponsor. Adopting a software delivery platform is
typically a large effort undertaken by multiple cross-functional teams. The
process usually results in changes to roles and responsibilities as well as
software development practices. To be successful in adopting these tools
and techniques, you need strong support from one or more members of the
leadership team. The most
effective leadership sponsors
are those who view these changes as a continuous process of improvement and
want to empower their teams instead of manage them.
Technical and business strategy alignment. We recommend that your
business teams and technical teams align on the four key software delivery
measures defined by
DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) :
lead time for changes, deployment frequency, time to restore service, and
change failure rate. Aligning on those measures gives your business teams
and technical teams a common goal, enabling them to jointly calculate return
on investment, adjust the rate of change, and modify the level of
investment.
Resources. To be successful, teams developing modern CI/CD practices
and building tool chains need the necessary resources: time, people, and
infrastructure. These teams need the time to
try and select the best processes and tools .
Ideally, these teams represent many different functions in the software
delivery process and can pull in other resources from across the
organization. Lastly, the teams need the ability to provision
infrastructure, including cloud resources and software tools.
Openness to adopt new tools. Modern CI/CD tools and techniques often
come with new tools and processes. Teams need to
experiment with those processes and tools
and be open to adopting them. A
feedback loop
is needed so that platform teams can hear from the application, operations,
and security teams that are using the platform.
Cultural readiness. To be successful in deploying and adopting a
modern CI/CD system with GKE, the organization and the
technical teams developing the system need to be prepared to change how
they operate and work together. For example, development and operations
teams need to be willing to take more
responsibility for security ,
and security and operations teams need to be willing to
streamline change approval processes .
Technical capabilities
Adopting a modern CI/CD approach also requires that your teams are technically
prepared in the following ways:
Experience with containers. Teams that are adopting modern CI/CD
approaches need some experience with containers. Ideally, this experience
includes development techniques for building container images and combining
containers to build larger systems.
Continuous integration strategy. Teams need some experience using CI
tools (such as Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo, and CircleCI) and performing some
continuous integration
and
automated testing .
We recommend that organizations plan how to further enhance those processes.
Deployment automation. Teams need some experience with
deployment automation .
Examples of automated deployment tools include basic shell scripts,
Terraform, Chef, or Puppet. Having a baseline knowledge of automated
deployment tools and processes is critical for streamlining and automating
deployments.
Service-oriented architectures. While it isn't a prerequisite to
adoption of modern CI/CD processes, adoption of more
modular and service-oriented architectures
must be a long-term goal of organizations that want to adopt modern CI/CD
tools and techniques with GKE. Service-based
architectures have been shown to improve velocity and reliability.
Modern source control. Modern source control tools like Git let
teams establish workflows like
trunk-based development ,
feature branches, and merge requests.
Design modern CI/CD with GKE
This section describes a software delivery platform and its components. To
improve software delivery performance, you need to implement CI/CD and other
technical best practices that let teams release quickly and operate efficiently.
This section also discusses the infrastructure needed to support the software
delivery lifecycle and how to consistently manage that infrastructure with
GKE. Lastly, this section provides an example software
delivery workflow and shows how starter repositories simplify the onboarding and
implementation of best practices. The following design considerations are
reviewed:
Software delivery platform. The framework and technical
capabilities that make up the foundations of a high-velocity, reliable
application release process.
Platform infrastructure. The infrastructure components and
management considerations you need to build the platform and run your
applications.
Software delivery workflow. How teams work together to build, test,
and deploy code more efficiently.
Code repositories. Repositories that perform several functions including storing the actual business logic, application specific configuration, and code to build infrastructure. These could also be starter repositories that
facilitate the adoption of best practices and help maintain consistency
across automated processes.
Application landing zones. Logic entity that lets developers
autonomously deploy and iterate on their applications using the guard rails
that you put in place.
Operating model. Technical tools, processes, and methods for
managing the infrastructure and applications that make up the platform.
Governance. Processes and considerations that you need to maintain
and manage the software delivery platform.
Software delivery platforms
A software delivery platform unifies the tools and streamlines the processes
needed to build, deliver, deploy, and operate applications.
Responsibility for maintaining an application's configuration, stability,
uptime, and scale varies between operators, security, and developer teams, but
all of the components and teams need to work together to speed up releases.
Although this document describes methods to improve source control management
and application observability, it focuses mainly on continuous integration (CI),
continuous delivery (CD), and configuration management.
To build a complete software delivery platform, you need each component
in the following diagram:
Each of these components provides functionality to the system and applications
running on the platform:
Infrastructure monitoring. The base level of monitoring needed when
provisioning in order to verify the correct functioning of
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
clusters, virtual machine (VM) instances, and
other infrastructure required for applications to function.
Container orchestration. The platform that coordinates the
deployment and operation of container-based applications. Examples of
platforms for container orchestration are Kubernetes,
GKE, or GKE Enterprise.
Container registry. The storage and access control for container images.
CI. The process of applying automated tasks
to an application before deployment. CI tasks typically include building,
packaging, and testing. The types of tasks vary based on the application
and organization.
CD. Deployment processes that are highly
automated and applied with high frequency. Example methodologies include
manual approvals, canary deployments, blue-green deployments, or rolling
deployments.
Policy. Security and infrastructure configuration policies defined
by the operations and security teams and continuously applied and enforced
by the platform.
Source code management. For example, version-controlled storage for
code, configuration files, and policy definitions. In a modern CI/CD
system, source code management is typically Git.
Configuration management. The system that is used in storing and
applying application configuration for different
environments.
Application observability. The application-level logging,
monitoring, alerting, and tracing that developer, operator, and security
teams use to troubleshoot and verify the proper operation of the
applications.
Platform infrastructure
To build a scalable software delivery platform, you need Kubernetes clusters
for development, pre-production environments, and multiple
production clusters. Clusters can serve many different functions:
Development. In these clusters, developers perform ad hoc
deployments of their applications for testing and experimentation.
The application environment.
Pre-production. For each pre-production environment in your
workflow, you should have a Kubernetes cluster to host your
applications. These clusters should resemble the production clusters so
that you can reduce or eliminate differences between the environments
and, as a result, improve deployment success rates.
Production. These clusters run your production workloads.
You should use multiple, geographically distributed clusters. Doing so
improves reliability from infrastructure failures and eases Day 2
operations concerns, such as cluster upgrades and scaling.
The following diagram shows the high-level architecture:
In this architecture, you manage the clusters for each environment through
Config Sync .
Consistent cluster configuration is critical because it gives developer,
operator, and security teams confidence that pre-production and production
environments operate in similar ways. You can use
Config Sync to store and apply common configurations across your fleet of
clusters. After your cluster configuration is
standardized, auditable, and scalable, you can focus on the software delivery
workflow and onboarding and deploying applications.
You manage your deployments to dev, staging and production clusters through the
application's CI/CD pipelines. The source control management serves as the coordination point for application code and configuration. The CI/CD pipelines and the container images for an application are isolated to that application's environment. You initialize application and configuration repositories
by using starter repositories and automated tools. For example, you can use
Cloud Build to run Terraform
to onboard and initialize new applications automatically.
You deploy applications into their own landing zones on each cluster,
so that applications are network- and identity-isolated. You initialize
application landing zones across environments by using
Config Sync, and you use
Cloud Service Mesh or Multi Cluster Ingress
to make the production clusters seem like one cluster by creating a network mesh
that spans many clusters.
Software delivery workflow
A core component of the software delivery platform is the CI/CD system. When
platform builders begin to define the CI/CD process, they need to ensure that
each component produces or consumes artifacts that adhere to a standardized
interface. Using a standardized interface simplifies the replacement of
components when a better implementation comes to market.
When you create a platform for containerized applications, you can use the three
standardized interfaces between components: Git repositories, Docker images, and
Kubernetes manifests. These interfaces let you create a reusable and flexible
CI/CD pipeline with a development, build, and release workflow, as the following
diagram shows:
This workflow works as follows:
Developers commit their application code to the code repositories.
The CI system tests the code, creates a Docker image artifact, and
stores the artifact in a registry.
After the artifact is ready for deployment, a reference to it is added
to the application configuration.
That application configuration is rendered into a Kubernetes-readable
format and stored in a code repository. Updates to this repository triggers a
deployment pipeline that deploys the artifacts in an integrated development environment.
After the testing in the integrated development environment is done, operators promote the deployment to the pre-production environment.
After making sure the application is working as expected in the pre-production environment, operators obtain the approvals in the deployment pipeline and promote the release to the production environment.
When operators make changes to the base configurations, those changes
are applied across the organization. As operators commit changes to their
repositories, application configuration updates (and subsequent
deployments) can be triggered automatically. Or, the operators' changes can
be picked up the next time developers deploy their changes.
In parallel, security engineers can implement and tweak policies that
define what can be deployed, and then commit those policies to their policy
repository.
Using a GitOps methodology, you can require a declarative approach for any
changes to applications and clusters. With this approach, all changes are
subject to audit and review before they can be enforced. In this declarative
model, you store your configuration files in a Git repository, which lets you
maintain a log of changes, rollback failed deployments, and see the
potential impact of changes being proposed.
In the associated
reference architecture ,
you use
kustomize
to control the application configurations in your organization. The kustomize
tool lets operators create so-called bases of application configurations that
your development teams can tweak without needing to add or change any code in
the base. By defining base configurations, platform teams can create and iterate
on best practices for the organization. Operators and developers can iterate on
their deployments independently, with developers applying the best practices set
up by the operators. When operators need to implement a new best practice for
the organization, they make the change in the base, and the change is
automatically pulled in with the developers' next deployment.
Code repositories
Source code repositories are at the heart of the CI/CD system. Operators,
developers, and security engineers each have their own repositories to propagate
changes into the platform. Using a Git repository as the basis for all changes
in the system provides several benefits:
Built-in auditability. Commits contain information about when,
what, and who changed the system.
A simplified rollback process. Git's revert capability lets you
rollback to a previous state of the system.
Versioning. You can tag Git commits to denote a version of the
system's state.
Transactions. You must explicitly resolve state conflicts and review
them before you can integrate the changes into the state.
The following diagram shows how various teams interact with a centralized
repository for all changes:
The following sections explain how operators, developers, and security
engineers employ the Git repository in a modern CI/CD system.
Operator repositories
Operator-managed repositories contain best practices for CI/CD and application
configuration to help your teams onboard applications while adopting
organizational best practices from the start. With operators managing
repositories, developers can consume any updates to the organizational best
practices with as little disruption to their workflow as possible.
Operators can encode their organizations' best practices into two repositories.
The first repository is where operators maintain shared CI/CD pipeline best
practices. In this repository, operators provide developers with a library of
predefined tasks that they can use to build out their pipelines. The developers'
application repositories automatically inherit these tasks and the logic within
them; the tasks don't need to be manually copied over. Examples of the tasks
that you can standardize across the organization include the following:
Artifact building and storage
Testing methodologies for various languages
Deployment steps
Policy checks
Security scanning
The second repository that operators maintain stores best practices for
configuring an application. In the context of GKE, best
practices involve ensuring a way to manage declarative manifests in the
Kubernetes resource model .
These manifests describe the intended state of the application. Operators can
create base configurations for different types of applications, providing
developers a streamlined path for deploying their apps according to
organizational best practices.
Application repositories
Application repositories store the business logic of the application and any
specialized configuration that is needed for the application to properly
operate.
As operators create and maintain best practices in a codified way, developers
can use those best practices. To do so, developers reference the tasks for
CI/CD and the application bases that the operators created in their own
repositories. After developers make their changes, operators can further
customize the application's deployment by adding environment-specific
configurations such as database URLs or resource labels and annotations.
Examples of the artifacts that you can store in application repositories
include the following:
Application source code
A Dockerfile that describes how to build and run the application
The CI/CD pipeline definition
Extensions or modifications to the application configuration bases
created by operators
Infrastructure as code repositories
Infrastructure as code repositories store the code to build out the infrastructure required to run the applications. The infrastructure might include networking and container orchestration platforms like GKE. Typically, infrastructure admins own these repositories. Operators can update them to implement best practices.
Examples of the artifacts that you can store in application repositories
include the following:
Declarative language code (Terraform, Pulumi) that represents infrastructure objects.
Shell or python scripts that complement the declarative API definitions.
Extensions or modifications to the base infrastructure templates created by the infrastructure team.
Configuration and policy repositories
Ensuring a security-enhanced and consistent platform is a top priority for both
operators and security engineers.
Configuration
Centralized configuration lets you propagate configuration changes throughout
the system. Some common configuration items that you can manage centrally
include the following:
Kubernetes namespaces
Quotas
Role-based access controls (RBAC)
Network policies
You should consistently enforce these types of configurations throughout your
clusters so that application teams don't misuse or abuse the infrastructure.
Using
a Git repository
to store configuration can enhance processes such as auditing and deploying
configuration through methods such as GitOps. Tools like
Config Sync can simplify the process of uniformly applying
configurations across your infrastructure.
Policy
Because developers can extend the base configurations that operators create,
you need a way to constrain the resources created in the clusters that make up
the platform. In some cases, you might create a policy that lets developers
create resources only if those resources meet specific requirements—for
example, creating Kubernetes Service objects that cannot be configured for
external load balancing.
In the associated
reference architecture ,
you use Policy Controller to enforce policies.
Starter repositories
Starter repositories aid the adoption of CI/CD, infrastructure, and development best practices
across the platform. Starter repositories can greatly reduce the cost associated
with adopting best practices. The best practices, in turn, help to increase
feature velocity, reliability, and team productivity. In the associated
reference architecture ,
there are multiple
starter repositories
for CI, CD, Kubernetes configurations, Go, Java, and Python starter applications and infrastructure.
Continuous integration
Organizations typically have a standard set of tasks that get applied to
applications during CI. For example, in the reference implementation, the
base set of CI stages
are the following: compile code, and build a container image.
Because those stages are defined in the starter repository, they're applied
uniformly throughout the platform. Individual application teams can add
additional steps.
Continuous delivery
Similar to CI, the process for CD typically has a standard set of steps for
deploying applications through the dev, pre-production, and production environments.
Regardless of the deployment methodologies employed, the starter repository lets
platform teams uniformly apply those methodologies across applications and
environments. In the reference implementation, the deployment process
includes rollouts for dev, pre-production deployments, a production deployment across
multiple clusters, and manual approvals for the production deployment using Cloud Deploy .
Application configuration
For a software delivery platform to be effective, you need a uniform and
consistent way to apply application configuration. By using tools like
kustomize and starter repositories for Kubernetes configurations, platforms
can provide a consistent basis for application configuration. For example, in
the reference implementation, the
kustomize base configuration
initializes the application environment repositories with a known-good base set
of configurations. Individual application teams can then adapt the
configurations to their needs.
Starter applications
Starter applications can help you reduce the overhead associated with adopting
best practices—for example, observability and container best practices.
Observability. To efficiently operate an application and help
ensure reliability, applications need to account for logging, metrics, and
tracings. Starter applications help teams build in frameworks and
strategies that promote observability.
Container best practices. When you build containerized applications,
you should build small and clean container images.
Best practices for containers include packaging a single application in an
image, removing unnecessary tools from the image, and actively trying to
produce small images from minimal base images.
The reference architecture provides a
basic Go app , a basic Java app , and a basic Python app
as a starting point. You should add starter applications that are customized for
the languages, technology stacks, and types of applications that your teams
develop.
Infrastructure starter repositories
Infrastructure starter repositories come with the pre-written code required to create different infrastructure components. These repositories use standard templates and modules as decided by the infrastructure team.
For example, in the reference implementation, the
platform-template contains the starter code to build out a Google Cloud project, a Virtual Private Cloud, and a GKE cluster. This template is typically used by infrastructure teams to manage the infrastructure used by multiple application teams as a shared resource. Similarly, the infra-template contains basic starter infrastructure code that an application might require, for example, a Cloud Storage or a Spanner database. This template is typically used by the application teams to manage infrastructure for their applications.
Shared template repositories
Shared template repositories provide standard task templates that anyone in an organization can reuse. For example, infrastructure as code modules like Terraform modules that can be used to create infrastructure resources like networks and compute.
Application landing zones
When you use shared CI/CD, shared application configuration, and consistent
policy and configuration across clusters, you can tie these capabilities
together to create application landing zones.
A landing zone is a locked-down logic entity that lets developers deploy and
iterate on their applications. Application landing zones use the guard rails
that you put in place so that developers can operate autonomously. For each
application, you create a Kubernetes namespace in each cluster of each
environment (for example, for production, dev, or staging). This consistency
helps operators to debug and maintain the environments over time.
The following diagram illustrates the concept of landing zones:
Operating model
When you operate a software delivery platform with modern CI/CD, it's important
to keep the environments, infrastructure, and processes consistent and up to
date. Therefore, you need to carefully plan and choose the operating model for
the platform. You can choose from various models, such as clusters as a service,
blueprints, or a multi-tenant infrastructure.
Because it's important to maintain a consistent infrastructure, limit sprawl,
and enable teams to focus on delivering applications, we recommend that you
deploy a multi-tenant infrastructure. Deploying applications on a multi-tenant
infrastructure removes the need for application teams to manage infrastructure
and lets operator and security teams focus on keeping the infrastructure
consistent.
Considerations for multi-tenant infrastructure
When you build a multi-tenant software delivery platform, there are several
things you might consider building into the platform:
Workload isolation. The concept of application landing zones is to
provide a framework for isolating workloads. Landing zones are a
combination of namespaces, network policies, and RBAC. All of these
policies should be centrally managed and applied through
Config Sync.
Tenant usage monitoring. To obtain cost breakdowns on individual
namespaces and labels in a cluster, you can use
GKE usage metering .
GKE usage metering tracks information about resource
requests and resource usage for a cluster's workloads, which you can
further filter by namespaces and labels. When you enable
GKE usage metering on the multi-tenant cluster,
resource usage records are written to a
BigQuery
table. You can
export tenant-specific metrics to BigQuery datasets in the
corresponding tenant project, and auditors can then analyze those metrics
to determine cost breakdowns.
Resource quotas. To ensure that all tenants sharing a cluster have
fair access to the cluster resources, you need to enforce
resources quotas .
Create a resource quota for each namespace based on the number of Pods that
each tenant deploys, and the amount of memory and CPU that each Pod
requires.
Multiple clusters for each environment. To improve application and
platform reliability, you should use multiple clusters for each
pre-production and production environment. With multiple clusters
available, you can roll out applications individually to clusters for
additional levels of canary validation. Additionally, having multiple
clusters eases concerns that are related to the lifecycle of cluster
management and upgrades.
Tenant-specific logging and monitoring. To investigate the
operations of their applications, tenants need access to logs and metrics.
In a multi-tenant environment, logging and monitoring should be
application-specific. For metrics and monitoring, you can use
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus
and
Grafana
for each namespace. For logs, you need to
create a
sink
in order to export log entries to BigQuery datasets, and
then you filter the datasets by tenant namespace. Tenants can then access
the exported data in BigQuery.
For more information about a multi-tenant infrastructure, see
Best practices for enterprise multi-tenancy .
Isolation boundaries
A software delivery platform is built and used by multiple teams which makes it important to have proper isolation boundaries among different components of the platform. Isolation boundaries help build a robust platform by providing the following traits:
Decoupling responsibilities. Each team manages the resources in their isolation boundaries without worrying about the rest. For example, the infrastructure team is only responsible to maintain GKE clusters. Operators or developers are only responsible for maintaining the CI/CD pipelines and application code.
Granular access control. If the resources are segregated by isolation boundaries, use granular access control to limit access.
Reduces affected areas. You can independently make changes to a component without affecting other components.
Reduces manual errors. Because the access control is granular, you can avoid manual errors like accidentally deploying to a production cluster from a dev environment.
These isolation boundaries could exist between different applications, infrastructure and applications, or even between an application's different environments.
Governance
The main goal of software delivery platforms and modern CI/CD systems is to
improve the efficiency of the overall software delivery process. In terms of
managing the platform, you have two primary considerations: application
onboarding, which generally falls under the category of governance; and ongoing
development and maintenance of the platform (that is, treating the platform like
a product).
Application onboarding and management
The goal of adopting modern CI/CD methodology and tools is to streamline the
release process and the onboarding of new services. Onboarding new applications
should be a straightforward process that you can perform with minimal input from
operations and security teams. That doesn't mean that operations and security
teams aren't involved but that their initial input from a deployment and
security perspective is automatically handled through the provisioning process.
Once onboarded, operations and security teams are naturally included in the
release process through merge requests, policy updates, and enforcement of best
practices.
It is recommended to create some automation to onboard a new application. This may include creating code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, landing zones, and any infrastructure required for the application. Automation decouples the complex dependencies of development teams on other teams in the organization and provides developers autonomy to self-service an application. This lets the developers start iterating on the application's code very quickly and not waste time in performing the tasks other than writing the code. The automation should enable developers to get the application running in a development environment. To take the application to higher environments, other teams should be involved and the review process should be followed.
In the associated reference architecture , this automation is referred to as Application Factory.
Platform as a product
The CI/CD workflow is a software product, except that the users of the product
are development, operations, and security teams. With that in mind, the platform
requires the same software development roles and processes, such as product
owners, marketing (albeit internal facing), user feedback loops, and feature
development cycles.
Deploy CI/CD with GKE
As you begin to deploy modern CI/CD with GKE to the
organization, choosing the best pilot applications is critical. Development,
operations, and security teams also need to consider other factors as they
work, which this section discusses.
Selecting a pilot application
Choosing the first applications to move onto the platform can be a difficult
first step. Good candidates for pilots are services that process data or handle
requests but don't store data—for example caching layers, web frontends,
or event-based processing applications. Typically, these applications are more
resistant to small amounts of downtime and deployment errors that can occur any
time you work with new deployment and configuration management techniques. As
teams gain more experience with CI/CD and begin to experience benefits in
reliability and velocity, you can begin to move core services onto the software
delivery platform.
Developer considerations
When you work in a modern CI/CD development process, features, changes, and
deployments can occur both with increased frequency and more asynchronously.
Development teams need to realize how changes impact downstream or dependent
systems and how those changes are tested. Communication paths between
development, operations, and security teams need to be fluid. It's a good
practice to invest in better versioning practices both for applications and the
data contracts by which the different services communicate. Along with improving
communication methods and versioning, implementing features in
small pieces and utilizing feature branches and flags
can improve how you test and release features.
Operator considerations
With a software delivery platform, operations teams need to function more like
development teams. Instead of building externally facing features, they're
building internal tools and processes that help facilitate the development,
deployment, and operation of external-facing applications. Platform tools are
used by their own team as well as the development and security teams. Operators
should build tools to aid in rolling out new versions of applications and also
rolling them back in the case of application errors or deployment failures.
Operators should also put more emphasis on building monitoring and alerting
systems to
proactively detect failures and alert accordingly .
Security team considerations
Security teams should work to make security more of a shared responsibility
between themselves and operations and development teams. This pattern is
