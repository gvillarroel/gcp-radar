Autopilot
Standard
This page guides you through authenticating securely to the Kubernetes API server
from GKE clusters. You can secure your cluster by ensuring
that only authorized users and applications access your Kubernetes resources.
You'll learn about available authentication methods, the recommended authentication method,
and how to authenticate users, applications, and legacy systems.
For information on authenticating Kubernetes workloads to
Google Cloud APIs, refer to
Workload Identity Federation for GKE .
This page is for Security specialists and Operators who must
authenticate securely to the Kubernetes API server from GKE clusters.
This page provides essential information on available authentication methods and how to implement them. To learn more about
common roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Before reading this page, ensure that you're familiar with the following concepts:
General overview of authentication in Google Cloud
General overview of IAM and role-based access control (RBAC) in GKE
General overview of Kubernetes methods for authentication
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure that you have performed the following tasks:
Enable
the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
Enable Google Kubernetes Engine API
If you want to use the Google Cloud CLI for this task,
install and then
initialize the
gcloud CLI. If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest
version by running the gcloud components update command. Earlier gcloud CLI versions might not support running the commands in this document.
Note: For existing gcloud CLI
installations, make sure to set the compute/region property . If you use primarily zonal clusters, set the compute/zone instead. By setting a default location,
you can avoid errors in the gcloud CLI like the following:
One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location . You might need to specify the location in certain commands if the location of your cluster differs from the default that you set.
Authenticate users
GKE manages end-user authentication for you through the
Google Cloud CLI. The gcloud CLI authenticates users to
Google Cloud, sets up the Kubernetes configuration, gets an OAuth access
token for the cluster, and keeps the access token up-to-date.
All GKE clusters are configured to accept Google Cloud
user and service account identities, by validating the credentials presented by
kubectl and retrieving the email address associated with the user or service
account identity. As a result, the credentials for those accounts must include
the userinfo.email OAuth scope to successfully authenticate.
When you use gcloud to set up your environment's kubeconfig for a
new or existing cluster, gcloud
gives kubectl the same credentials used by gcloud itself. For example, if
you use gcloud auth login , your personal credentials are provided to
kubectl , including the userinfo.email scope. This allows the
GKE cluster to authenticate the kubectl client.
Alternatively, you may choose to configure kubectl to use the credentials of a
Google Cloud service account, while running on a Compute Engine
instance. However, by default, the userinfo.email scope is not included in
credentials created by Compute Engine instances. Therefore, you must add
this scope explicitly, such as by using the --scopes flag when the
Compute Engine instance is created.
You can authorize actions in your cluster using
Identity and Access Management (IAM) or Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC) .
Note: Before OAuth integration with GKE, the pre-provisioned
X.509 certificate or a static password were the only available authentication
methods. These methods are no longer recommended and are disabled by default on
all new clusters. If you use legacy authentication methods ,
we recommend that you migrate to newer authentication methods.
Authenticate with OAuth
To authenticate to your cluster using the OAuth method, perform the following:
Sign in to the gcloud CLI using your credentials. This opens
a web browser to complete the authentication process to Google Cloud:
gcloud auth login
Caution: Don't perform this on a Compute Engine VM where all users have
access to root . Use a service account for authentication. For details, see
the Applications within Google Cloud section.
Retrieve the Kubernetes credentials for a specific cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION : the Compute Engine
location of the control plane of your
cluster. Provide a region for regional clusters, or a zone for zonal clusters.
Verify that you are authenticated:
kubectl cluster-info
Once users or Google Cloud service accounts are authenticated, they must
also be authorized to perform any action on a GKE cluster.
For more information on how to configure authorization, see
role-based access control .
Authenticate applications
You can also authenticate to the API server from an application in a Pod
without user interaction, such as from a script in your CI/CD pipeline. How you
achieve this depends on the environment where your application is running.
Application in the same cluster
If your application is running in the same GKE cluster,
use a Kubernetes service account to authenticate.
Create a
Kubernetes service account
and attach it to your Pod. If your Pod already has a Kubernetes service
account, or if you want to use the namespace's default service account,
skip this step.
Use Kubernetes RBAC to grant the Kubernetes service account the permissions
that your application requires.
The following example grants view permissions to resources in the prod
namespace to a service account named cicd in the cicd-ns namespace:
kubectl create rolebinding cicd-secret-viewer \
--namespace = prod \
--clusterrole = view \
--serviceaccount = cicd-ns:cicd
At runtime, when your application sends a Kubernetes API request, the API
server authenticates the service account credentials.
Applications within Google Cloud
If your application runs inside Google Cloud but outside the target
cluster (for example, a Compute Engine VM or another GKE
cluster), you should authenticate to the API server using the IAM
service account credentials available in the environment.
Assign an IAM service account to your environment. If your
application is running inside a Compute Engine VM,
assign an IAM service account
to the instance. If your application is running in a different
GKE cluster, use
Workload Identity Federation for GKE to
configure your Pod to run as an IAM service account.
The examples that follow use
ci-cd-pipeline@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
as the IAM service account.
Grant the IAM service account access to the cluster.
The following example grants the roles/container.developer
IAM role, which provides access to Kubernetes API objects
inside clusters:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount:ci-cd-pipeline@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/container.developer
Alternatively, you can use RBAC to grant the IAM service
account access to the cluster. Run the kubectl create rolebinding command
from
Applications in the same cluster and use
--user=ci-cd-pipeline@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
instead of the --service-account flag.
Retrieve the cluster credentials:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Your application is automatically authenticated using the IAM
service account set on the environment.
Applications in other environments
If your application is authenticating from an environment outside
Google Cloud, it cannot access managed IAM service account
credentials. To retrieve cluster credentials, you can create an IAM
service account, download its key, and use the key at runtime from your service
to retrieve cluster credentials with the gcloud CLI.
Caution: IAM service account keys are long-lived credentials.
Anyone with access to the key can use it to perform authorized actions in your
Google Cloud project. Managing keys can be difficult at scale. Consider
using
workload identity federation ,
which configures credentials issued by external identity providers to
impersonate IAM service accounts and access Google Cloud
resources.
Create an IAM service account for your application. If you
already have an IAM service account, skip this step.
The following command creates an IAM service account named
ci-cd-pipeline :
gcloud iam service-accounts create ci-cd-pipeline
Grant the IAM service account access to your cluster.
The following command grants the roles/container.developer
IAM role to the
ci-cd-pipeline@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
IAM service account:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount:ci-cd-pipeline@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/container.developer
You can also use RBAC to grant the IAM service account access
to the cluster. Run the kubectl create rolebinding command from
Applications in the same cluster and use
--user=ci-cd-pipeline@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
instead of the --service-account flag.
Create and download a key for your IAM service account. Make
it available to your application at runtime:
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create gsa-key.json \
--iam-account = ci-cd-pipeline@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
At runtime, in the environment running your application, authenticate to the
gcloud CLI by using your IAM service account key:
gcloud auth activate-service-account ci-cd-pipeline@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--key-file = gsa-key.json
Use the gcloud CLI to retrieve the cluster credentials:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Environments without gcloud
Using the gcloud CLI to retrieve cluster credentials is recommended
because this method is resilient to cluster events like a control plane IP rotation
or credential rotation .
However, if you cannot install the gcloud CLI in your environment,
you can still create a static kubeconfig file to authenticate to the cluster:
Create an IAM service account for your application. If you
already have an IAM service account, skip this step.
The following command creates an IAM service account named
ci-cd-pipeline :
gcloud iam service-accounts create ci-cd-pipeline
Grant the IAM service account access to your cluster.
The following command grants the roles/container.developer
IAM role to the
ci-cd-pipeline@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
IAM service account:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount:ci-cd-pipeline@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/container.developer
You can also create a
custom IAM role for
fine-grained control over the permissions that you grant.
Create and download a key for your IAM service account.
In the following example, the key file is named gsa-key.json :
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create gsa-key.json \
--iam-account = ci-cd-pipeline@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com
If you're using the DNS-based endpoint for control plane access, get the
endpoint value for your cluster:
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--format = "value(endpoint)"
If you're using the IP-based endpoint for control plane access, get the
endpoint value from the preceding command, and get the
clusterCaCertificate value for your cluster:
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--format = "value(masterAuth.clusterCaCertificate)"
Create a kubeconfig.yaml file. Use the following format if you're using
the DNS-based endpoint for control plane access:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Config
clusters :
- name : CLUSTER_NAME
cluster :
server : https:// endpoint
users :
- name : ci-cd-pipeline-gsa
user :
exec :
apiVersion : client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1
args :
- --use_application_default_credentials
command : gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
installHint : Install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin for kubectl by following
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#install_plugin
provideClusterInfo : true
contexts :
- context :
cluster : CLUSTER_NAME
user : ci-cd-pipeline-gsa
name : CLUSTER_NAME -ci-cd
current-context : CLUSTER_NAME -ci-cd
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your cluster.
endpoint : the value you obtained for endpoint
from the previous step.
If you're using IP-based endpoints for control plane access, add the value
you obtained for clusterCaCertificate from the preceding step in the
cluster parameter of the kubeconfig.yaml file:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Config
clusters :
- name : CLUSTER_NAME
cluster :
server : https:// endpoint
certificate-authority-data : masterAuth.clusterCaCertificate
users :
...
You don't need to decode the base64-encoded certificate.
Deploy kubeconfig.yaml and gsa-key.json alongside your application in
your environment. At runtime, in the environment running your application,
set these environment variables:
export KUBECONFIG = path/to/kubeconfig.yaml
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = path/to/gsa-key.json
Your application can now send requests to the Kubernetes API and will be
authenticated as the IAM service account.
Update legacy authentication methods
Note: For GKE Autopilot clusters, legacy
authentication methods cannot be used. Note: Basic authentication is deprecated and has been removed in
GKE 1.19 and later.
Before OAuth integration with GKE, the pre-provisioned
X.509 certificate or a static password were the only available authentication
methods, but are no longer recommended and should be disabled. These methods
present a wider surface of attack for cluster compromise and are disabled
by default on clusters running GKE version 1.12 and later.
If you use legacy authentication methods, we recommend that you turn them off.
If enabled, a user with the container.clusters.getCredentials permission can
retrieve the client certificate and static password. The roles/container.admin ,
roles/owner , and roles/editor roles all have this permission, so use those
roles wisely. Read more about IAM roles in GKE .
Disable authentication with a static password
A static password is a username and password combination that the API server
validates. In GKE, this authentication method is referred to
as basic authentication.
Note: Basic authentication is deprecated and has been removed in
GKE 1.19 and later.
To update an existing cluster and remove the static password:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--no-enable-basic-auth
Disable authentication with a client certificate
With certificate authentication, a client presents a certificate that the API
server verifies with the specified certificate authority. In GKE,
the cluster root Certificate Authority (CA)
signs client certificates.
Client certificate authentication has implications on authorization to the
Kubernetes API server. If legacy Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)
authorization is enabled on the cluster, by default, client certificates can
authenticate and perform any action on the API server. On the other hand, with
Role Based Access Control (RBAC) enabled, client certificates must be granted
specific authorization to Kubernetes resources.
Note: In GKE 1.8 and later, legacy ABAC is disabled by default,
and the client certificate is not granted permissions.
To create a cluster without generating a client certificate, use the
--no-issue-client-certificate flag:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
--no-issue-client-certificate
Currently, there is no way to remove a client certificate from an existing
cluster. To stop using client certificate authentication on an existing cluster,
ensure you have RBAC enabled on the cluster, and that the client certificate
does not have any authorization on the cluster.
Note: The --no-issue-client-certificate flag only disables legacy
GKE client certificate issuance. It does not disable the
Kubernetes certificates API ,
which is used to operate the cluster and cannot be disabled.
