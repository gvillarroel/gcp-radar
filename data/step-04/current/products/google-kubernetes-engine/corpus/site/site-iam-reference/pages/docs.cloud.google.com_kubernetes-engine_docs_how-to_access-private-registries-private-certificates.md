Autopilot
Standard
This page shows you how to allow workloads running in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to access private image registries
by using the public key of the certificate authority (CA) that
issued the certificate for the registry.
This page is for Security specialists who manage access for their organization's
workloads. To learn more about
common roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Before reading this page, ensure that you're familiar with Secret Manager .
How accessing private registries works
You store the public key of the CA used to issue certificates for your private
registries in Secret Manager and configure which registry
fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) use that public key for certificate
validation. GKE automatically fetches the key and
updates the container runtime registry configuration during node bootstrapping.
When you deploy a workload that uses a container image from your private
registry, the following steps occur:
The kubelet on the node tries to pull the image from the private registry.
The registry presents a server-side TLS certificate.
The container runtime validates the registry certificate cryptographically
and to ensure that the FQDN matches what you specified.
If the validation passes, GKE pulls the image and schedules
your workload.
Benefits
This method of accessing private registries provides benefits like the following:
Improve reliability of container runtime configuration : Using methods
like DaemonSets to set the containerd configuration adds a risk of a race
condition occurring, where other DaemonSets might run before your
configuration DaemonSet.
Reduce vulnerability to privilege escalation attacks : Removes the need
to run privileged DaemonSets that modify your container runtime
configuration.
Reduce management overhead : Secret Manager
lets you store CA public keys in a central location; manage access to the
keys using IAM; and implement version control and
annotations. For more information, see the
Secret Manager product overview .
Improve auditability : Cloud Logging already collects logs, including
when certificates are added to a cluster and when GKE nodes
pull images.
Pricing
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
Secret Manager
Logging :
GKE generates Admin Activity audit logs and, if enabled,
Data Access audit logs for this feature. For information about the different
types of audit logs, see
GKE audit logging .
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage, use the
pricing calculator .
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure that you have performed the following tasks:
Enable
the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
Enable Google Kubernetes Engine API
If you want to use the Google Cloud CLI for this task,
install and then
initialize the
gcloud CLI. If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest
version by running the gcloud components update command. Earlier gcloud CLI versions might not support running the commands in this document.
Note: For existing gcloud CLI
installations, make sure to set the compute/region property . If you use primarily zonal clusters, set the compute/zone instead. By setting a default location,
you can avoid errors in the gcloud CLI like the following:
One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location . You might need to specify the location in certain commands if the location of your cluster differs from the default that you set.
Enable the Secret Manager API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
You must already have a private registry and private CA certificates to
access the registry. This guide doesn't cover setting up a private registry or
creating certificates.
Requirements
To use private CA public keys to access private registries, you must meet the
following requirements:
Your clusters must use GKE version 1.27.3-gke.1700 or later.
You must either use a Container-Optimized OS with containerd
node image, which is the default for all GKE clusters, or Ubuntu
node images with containerd that are version 1.33.0 or later. Windows Server node images
aren't supported.
Your node pools must have the cloud-platform access scope for your nodes to
download the certificates. For more information, see
Default access scopes in GKE .
This document includes instructions to set the access scope when you create a
cluster or node pool.
Limitations
Consider the following limitations:
If GKE can't access the certificate during the node boot
process, the node boots without the private CA certificate. Workloads on
that node can't access the private registry. To resolve this issue, see
Troubleshoot issues with the container runtime .
You can't use private CA certificates in Ubuntu node images with a version that's earlier than 1.33.0.
You can't use private CA certificates in Windows Server nodes.
Each cluster supports up to five private CA certificates for private
registries.
Each certificate can have up to 25 fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs).
Each domain can only be used in a single certificate file. However,
certificate bundles are supported.
Certificates must be
PEM-encoded .
The server doesn't automatically rotate certificates. For more information,
see Rotate your private CA certificates in this
document.
FQDNs have the following limitations:
The maximum FQDN length is 255 characters, including special characters.
FQDNs can only use letters, numbers, and dashes (-).
Punycode isn't supported.
Wildcard characters aren't supported.
Migrate from configuration DaemonSets
In GKE Standard clusters, you can deploy privileged
DaemonSets to modify your container runtime configuration. This method directly
modifies the containerd configuration on each node.
If you use privileged DaemonSets to configure access to private registries,
consider the following before you use this document:
Storing private CA public keys in Secret Manager only
configures access to private registries. Other registry-related
configuration isn't supported.
Enabling this feature causes your cluster to use containerd's
CRI hostpath configuration model ,
which is incompatible with the previous configuration model. If you have any
DaemonSets that modify the containerd host configuration, such as for
insecure private registries, mirrors, or proxies, update the DaemonSets to
use the CRI hostpath model.
For the available fields in the CRI hostpath model, see
Registry configuration
in the containerd GitHub repository.
Note: If you disable this feature later, your nodes revert to the previous
model for registry configuration in containerd. You must modify your
DaemonSets to use the previous model. For information about the previous
configuration model, see
Configure registry credentials .
When you enable this feature, GKE applies the CRI hostpath
configuration model to new nodes in the cluster. Existing nodes continue to
use the previous configuration model until they're recreated during events like
upgrades.
Update DaemonSets to support both configuration models
To reduce the risk of your configuration DaemonSets not working on nodes that
support a specific configuration model, ensure that your DaemonSets
conditionally use a specific configuration model depending on the containerd
configuration files on the node. For an example DaemonSet that implements this
conditional logic, in the GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-node-tools GitHub
repository, see the
insecure-registry-config.yaml manifest .
Store your CA public keys in Secret Manager
Store the public keys of your private CAs that issue your private registry
certificates as secrets in Secret Manager.
For instructions, in the Secret Manager documentation, see
Create a secret .
Configure access to Secret Manager from GKE
To ensure that the cluster's IAM service account has the necessary
permissions to pull secrets from Secret Manager,
ask your administrator to grant the
following IAM roles to the cluster's IAM service account on the secret:
Important: You must grant these roles
to the cluster's IAM service account, not to your user account. Failure to grant the roles to the correct principal might result in permission errors.
Access secret content:
Secret Manager Secret Accessor ( roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor )
Access secret metadata:
Secret Manager Viewer ( roles/secretmanager.viewer )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to pull secrets from Secret Manager. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to pull secrets from Secret Manager:
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
secretmanager.secrets.get
secretmanager.secrets.list
secretmanager.versions.get
secretmanager.versions.list
secretmanager.versions.access
Your administrator might also be able to give the cluster's IAM service account
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
If you didn't associate a custom IAM service account with your
cluster or node pool, which is our recommended approach, the cluster uses the
Compute Engine default service account .
Note: If you don't use custom IAM service accounts to create your
GKE clusters or node pools, ensure that the default Compute Engine
service account in your project has the required permissions for GKE.
In organizations that enforce the
iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts organization policy constraint , the default Compute Engine service account won't automatically
get the required permissions for GKE. This constraint is enforced by default for
organizations that were created on or after May 3, 2024.
For details, see
Default GKE node service account .
If possible, we recommend that you configure your clusters and node pools with a
minimally privileged IAM service account. For instructions, see
Use least-privileged service accounts .
Create a runtime configuration file
To enable the ability to use private CA certificates for private registries in
GKE, you create a YAML file to modify the containerd
configuration.
Get your Google Cloud project number:
gcloud projects describe PROJECT_ID \
--format = "value(projectNumber)"
The output is your numerical project number.
Save the following configuration as containerd-configuration.yaml . You could use either registryHosts (preferred) or privateRegistryAccessConfig field
registryHosts
registryHosts :
- server : " REGISTRY_SERVER_FQDN "
hosts :
- host : " MIRROR_FQDN "
capabilities :
- "HOST_CAPABILITY_PULL"
- "HOST_CAPABILITY_RESOLVE"
ca :
- gcpSecretManagerSecretUri : "projects/ PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER /secrets/ SECRET_NAME /versions/ SECRET_VERSION "
Replace the following:
REGISTRY_SERVER_FQDN : the hostname of the registry server. This should be fully-qualified domain names or IPv4 addresses.
MIRROR_FQDN : the hostname of the registry mirror. This should be fully-qualified domain names or IPv4 addresses.
PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER : the project ID or project
number that you got in the previous step.
SECRET_NAME : the secret name in Secret Manager.
SECRET_VERSION : the version number of your secret in
Secret Manager. You can optionally use a version alias, but
we recommend using the version number to avoid management complexity.
For a description of these fields, see
registryHosts
in the Available containerd configuration options.
privateRegistryAccessConfig
privateRegistryAccessConfig :
certificateAuthorityDomainConfig :
- gcpSecretManagerCertificateConfig :
secretURI : "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /secrets/ SECRET_NAME /versions/ SECRET_VERSION "
fqdns :
- " FQDN1 "
- " FQDN2 "
enabled : true
Replace the following:
PROJECT_NUMBER : the project number that you got in
the previous step.
SECRET_VERSION : the version number of your secret in
Secret Manager. You can optionally use a version alias, but
we recommend using the version number to avoid management complexity.
FQDN1 , FQDN2 : the
fully-qualified domain names for your private registries. You can also use
an IPv4 address if a certificate was issued for that address, but we don't
recommend it.
For a description of these fields, see
privateRegistryAccessConfig
in the Available containerd configuration options.
Apply containerd configuration to new clusters
This section shows you how to apply a containerd configuration file when you create a new
GKE cluster.
Run the following command to create Autopilot clusters:
gcloud container clusters create-auto CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--scopes = "cloud-platform" \
--containerd-config-from-file = " PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE "
Note : If your configuration file does not use secrets from
Secret Manager, such as for the privateRegistryAccessConfig feature or when
using registryHosts with certificates stored in Secret Manager, you can
remove the --scopes="cloud-platform" flag.
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your new cluster.
LOCATION : the Compute Engine location of your new cluster.
PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE : the path to the configuration file that you
created, like ~/containerd-configuration.yaml .
You can enable the containerd configuration on new Standard clusters by running the
gcloud container clusters create command with the same options.
Apply containerd configuration to new node pools
You can apply the containerd configuration to a new GKE node pool with following command:
gcloud container node-pools create NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--scopes = "cloud-platform" \
--containerd-config-from-file = " PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE "
Note : If your configuration file does not use secrets from Secret Manager,
such as for the privateRegistryAccessConfig feature or when using registryHosts
with certificates stored in Secret Manager, you can remove the
--scopes="cloud-platform" flag.
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : the name of your new node pool.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the existing cluster.
LOCATION : the Compute Engine location of your new node pool.
PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE : the path to the configuration file that you
created, like ~/containerd-configuration.yaml .
Apply containerd configuration to existing clusters
This section shows you how to apply a containerd configuration to existing clusters and nodes.
Note : Updating a cluster with a containerd configuration recreates the
nodes to apply the configuration. This might cause temporary disruptions in running workloads.
GKE only recreates nodes if automatic upgrades are enabled. This recreation
respects any
maintenance windows
that you set. In Standard clusters that don't have automatic upgrades enabled, you must
manually recreate your nodes to apply the configuration.
Check access scopes
If your configuration file uses secrets from Secret Manager, your cluster or node pool
must have the cloud-platform access scope. This section shows you how to check
your access scopes and update an existing cluster with a new or modified runtime configuration
file.
For details about the default access scopes in new clusters, see
Access scopes in GKE .
Check Autopilot access scopes
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--flatten = nodeConfig \
--format = 'csv[delimiter="\\n",no-heading](oauthScopes)'
If you are using secrets from Secret Manager and your cluster doesn't have the
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform access scope, create a new cluster
with this access scope.
Check Standard access scopes
To check your Standard cluster access scopes, check a node pool:
gcloud container node-pools describe NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--format = 'value[delimiter="\\n"](config.oauthScopes)'
Replace NODE_POOL_NAME with the name of the node pool.
If you are using secrets from Secret Manager and your cluster doesn't have the
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform access scope, create a new node
pool with the cloud-platform access scope and delete your existing node pool.
Update the cluster to use your configuration file
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--containerd-config-from-file = " PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE "
Recreate nodes in Standard clusters
If your Standard cluster doesn't use automatic upgrades, you must manually recreate
your node pools to apply the new configuration. To trigger a manual node recreation, upgrade your
cluster to the same GKE version that it already uses.
gcloud container clusters upgrade CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--cluster-version = VERSION
Replace VERSION with the same GKE patch version that the
cluster already uses.
Verify that your cluster can access the private registry
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--flatten = "nodePoolDefaults.nodeConfigDefaults.containerdConfig"
The output is similar to the following:
registryHosts
containerdConfig:
registryHosts:
- server: example.io
hosts:
- host: example.mirror.io
capabilities:
- "HOST_CAPABILITY_PULL"
- "HOST_CAPABILITY_RESOLVE"
ca:
- gcpSecretManagerSecretUri: projects/123456789012/secrets/example-secret-name/versions/1
privateRegistryAccessConfig
containerdConfig:
privateRegistryAccessConfig:
certificateAuthorityDomainConfig:
- fqdns:
- 203.0.113.105
gcpSecretManagerCertificateConfig:
secretUri: projects/123456789012/secrets/example-secret-name/versions/1
enabled: true
Deploy a workload that accesses a private image
In this section, you deploy a static Pod that references an image from your
private registry.
Save the following manifest as private-registry-pod.yaml :
apiVersion : v1
kind : Pod
metadata :
name : private-registry-pod
spec :
containers :
- name : private-image
image : IMAGE_NAME
Replace IMAGE_NAME with your private image name.
Deploy the Pod:
kubectl create -f private-registry-pod.yaml
Rotate your private CA certificates
Secret Manager and GKE can't automatically rotate
private CA certificates in Secret Manager. To perform a
certificate rotation, do the following steps. These steps require that you
recreate existing nodes twice. We recommend that you perform certificate
rotations during scheduled downtime to minimize the impact of workload
disruptions.
Create a PEM-encoded certificate bundle that contains both your old and new
certificates.
Add the bundle as a new secret version in Secret Manager .
Update your runtime configuration file secretURI field with the new
secret version number.
Update your cluster to use the new secret version .
Get the timestamp of the update operation:
gcloud container operations list \
--filter = "operationType ~ UPDATE_CLUSTER AND targetLink ~ CLUSTER_NAME " \
--sort-by = startTime \
--limit = 1 \
--format = 'value(endTime)'
The output is similar to the following:
2024-01-31T09:27:30.864308964Z
Look for nodes that were created before the update operation ended:
kubectl get nodes -o json | jq ".items[] |
select(.metadata.creationTimestamp | fromdateiso8601 < $( date -d
CLUSTER_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP +%s ) ) | .metadata.name"
Replace CLUSTER_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP with the timestamp
from the previous step.
The output is a list of node names that haven't been recreated with the
updated configuration. When the output is blank , proceed to the next
step.
Create a new version of your secret in Secret Manager with
only the new certificate.
Repeat the previous steps to update your cluster, get the
operation timestamp, and verify that your nodes use the new secret version.
Delete the old secret version from Secret Manager.
View audit logs in Logging
This section shows you how to use Logging to check whether
GKE installed your secret version on your nodes.
If downloadinging secret fails, nodes will have two conditions set:
PrivateCA4CRUserConfigError or PrivateCA4CRInternalError depending on error
types. And you could check Logging message for detailed errors.
Go to the Logs Explorer page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to Logs Explorer
Search logs with specific queries:
registryHosts
Query the logs with following filter.
resource.type="gce_instance"
(textPayload:"Successfully fetched secret" OR textPayload:"error pulling certificate")
If your certificate installation succeeded, you could find following log entry:
Successfully fetched secret "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /secrets/ SECRET_NAME /versions/ SECRET_VERSION "
Successfully wrote secret payload for "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /secrets/ SECRET_NAME /versions/ SECRET_VERSION "
If your certificate installation failed, you could find following log entry:
User error pulling certificate "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /secrets/ SECRET_NAME /versions/ SECRET_VERSION " from GSM: ...
Or
Internal error pulling certificate "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /secrets/ SECRET_NAME /versions/ SECRET_VERSION " from GSM: ....
privateRegistryAccessConfig
Query the logs with following filter.
resource.type="gce_instance"
textPayload:"Installed certificate \\\"projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /secrets/ SECRET_NAME /versions/ SECRET_VERSION \\\""
If your certificate installation succeeded, the output is similar to the
following:
"Installed certificate "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /secrets/ SECRET_NAME /versions/ SECRET_VERSION ""
If your certificate installation failed, the output is similar to the
following:
"Failed to install certificate "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /secrets/ SECRET_NAME /versions/ SECRET_VERSION ""
Best practices
We recommend that you use the following best practices when you use this
feature:
Don't use aliases for Secret Manager secret versions. Use the
auto-generated version number for each secret version. An alias might point
to a different certificate version over time, which might cause complexities
in tracking the specific versions that your workloads use.
Use
maintenance windows and exclusions
to control when GKE can recreate your nodes to apply updated
containerd configurations.
Provide access to secrets at the secret level, not at the project level.
Disable containerd configuration options
Disable privateRegistryAccessConfig
Update your configuration file to specify enabled: false in privateRegistryAccessConfig
and delete any other fields in the item, like in the following example:
privateRegistryAccessConfig :
enabled : false
Apply the updated configuration file to your cluster. For instructions, see
Apply containerd configuration to existing clusters .
Disable registryHosts
Update your configuration file to specify an empty array in the registryHosts
item, like in the following example:
registryHosts : []
Apply the updated configuration file to your cluster. For instructions, see
Apply containerd configuration to existing clusters .
