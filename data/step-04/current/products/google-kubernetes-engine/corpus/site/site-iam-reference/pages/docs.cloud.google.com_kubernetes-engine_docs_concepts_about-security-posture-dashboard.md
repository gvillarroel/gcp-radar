Autopilot
Standard
This page provides an overview of the security posture dashboard in the
Google Cloud console, which provides you with opinionated, actionable
recommendations to improve your security posture. To explore the dashboard
yourself, go to the
Security Posture page
in the Google Cloud console.
When to use the security posture dashboard
You should use the security posture dashboard if you're a cluster
administrator or a security administrator who wants to automate detection and
reporting of common security concerns across multiple clusters and workloads,
with minimal intrusion and disruption to your running applications. The
security posture dashboard integrates with products such as Cloud Logging,
and Policy Controller to improve your visibility into your
security posture.
If you use VPC Service Controls, you can also
update your perimeters
to protect the security posture dashboard by adding
containersecurity.googleapis.com to the list of services.
The security posture dashboard doesn't change any of our responsibilities or your
responsibilities under the
shared responsibility model .
You're still responsible for protecting your workloads.
Usage as part of a broad security strategy
The security posture dashboard provides insights about your workload
security posture at the runtime phase of the software delivery lifecycle. To
gain comprehensive coverage of your applications throughout the lifecycle from
source control to maintenance, we recommend that you use the dashboard with other
security tooling.
GKE offers the security posture dashboard to monitor
security in the Google Cloud console.
For more details about other available tooling and for best
practices to safeguard your applications from end to end, see
Protect your software supply chain .
We also strongly recommend that you implement as many recommendations
as possible from Harden your cluster security .
How the security posture dashboard works
To use the security posture dashboard, enable the Container Security API
in your project. The dashboard shows you insights from capabilities that are
built into GKE and from certain Google Cloud security
products running in your project.
Cluster-specific feature enablement
The GKE-specific capabilities in the security posture dashboard
are categorized as follows:
Kubernetes security posture : The security posture of Kubernetes objects
and resources in the cluster, such as Pod specifications. For details, see
About Kubernetes security posture scanning .
Workload vulnerability scanning : The security posture of the container
operating system and application language packages. For details, see
About workload vulnerability scanning .
Caution: Starting on July 23, 2024, container
OS vulnerability scanning is deprecated and is scheduled for shutdown on
July 31, 2025. Starting on June 16, 2025,
Advanced Vulnerability Insights is deprecated and is scheduled for shutdown on
June 16, 2026. For more information about deprecation and shutdown dates, see
Vulnerability scanning removal from GKE .
The following table describes the cluster-specific features:

You can enable these features for standalone GKE clusters or
fleet member clusters .
The security posture dashboard lets you observe all your clusters
simultaneously, including all fleet members in your fleet host project.
Integration with Security Command Center
If you activate Security Command Center in your organization or project, then you
see security posture dashboard findings in Security Command Center. For more
details about Security Command Center findings that appear on the
security posture dashboard, see
Security sources .
Important : Security bulletin findings that are published in Security Command Center
don't include a cve field that lists the associated CVEs. To view the CVEs,
check the finding's description field, or review the security bulletin in the
security posture dashboard.
Also, if you activate the Premium or Enterprise
service tier of
Security Command Center in your organization or project, then the
security posture dashboard shows the following additional panes:
Top threats : summarizes the top threats that affect your GKE
workloads, grouped by severity and category.
Top software vulnerabilities ( Preview ):
lists the top CVEs that are associated with Security Command Center findings for
your GKE workloads.
To activate the Security Command Center Premium tier in your project, do the
following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the GKE Security Posture page.
Go to GKE Security Posture
Find the Sample threats pane. This pane shows examples of the types of
security findings that you might see after you enable Security Command Center.
These examples don't represent actual security issues in your project.
If you see a pane titled Top threats , then Security Command Center is already
activated. You can skip the remaining steps.
In the Sample threats pane, click Try security scanning for free .
The activation pane opens.
Click Start free trial .
Note: Some Security Command Center features require you to
activate the Enterprise tier ,
or to activate the Premium tier for an organization .
After you activate Security Command Center, it starts to analyze, or scan, your
GKE workloads and your resources for other Google Cloud
services. This initial scan is
usually complete within minutes or hours .
Benefits of the security posture dashboard
The security posture dashboard is a foundational security measure that you
can enable for any eligible GKE cluster. Google Cloud
recommends using the security posture dashboard for all your clusters for
the following reasons:
Minimal disruptions : Features don't interfere with or disrupt running
workloads.
Actionable recommendations : When available, the security posture dashboard
provides action items to fix discovered concerns. These actions include
commands that you can run and examples of configuration changes to make.
Visualization : The security posture dashboard provides a
high-level visualization of concerns affecting clusters across your project,
and includes charts and graphs to show the progress you've made and the
potential impact of each concern.
Opinionated results : GKE assigns a
severity rating to discovered concerns based on the
expertise of our security teams and industry standards.
Auditable event logs : GKE adds all discovered concerns to
Logging for better reportability and observability.
Fleet observability : If you've registered GKE clusters to
a fleet , the dashboard lets
you observe all of your project's clusters, including fleet member clusters
and any standalone GKE clusters in the project.

Logging. For details, see
Logging pricing .
Manage fleet security posture
If you use fleets with
GKE, you can configure GKE security posture
features at the fleet level using the gcloud CLI. GKE
clusters that you register as fleet members during cluster creation automatically
inherit the security posture configuration. Clusters that were already fleet
members before you changed the security posture configuration don't inherit the
new configuration. This inherited configuration overrides the default settings
that GKE applies to new clusters.
To learn how to change your fleet-level security posture configuration, see
Configure GKE security posture dashboard features at fleet-level .
About the Security Posture page
The Security Posture page in the Google Cloud console has the
following tabs:
Dashboard : a high-level representation of the results of your scans.
Includes charts and feature-specific information.
Concerns : a detailed, filterable view of any concerns discovered by
GKE across your clusters and workloads. You can
select individual concerns for details and mitigation options.
Settings : manage the security posture feature configuration for
individual clusters or for fleets.
Dashboard
The Dashboard tab provides a visual representation of the results of
various GKE security posture scans and information from other
Google Cloud security products that are enabled in your project. For
details about the available scanning capabilities and other supported security
products, see
How the security posture dashboard works in this document.
If you use fleets with GKE, the dashboard also
displays any discovered concerns for clusters including
clusters in the project's fleet and standalone clusters. To switch the
dashboard to view the posture of a specific fleet, select the host project for
that fleet from the project selector drop-down menu in the Google Cloud console. If
the selected project has the Container Security API enabled, the
dashboard shows results for all member clusters of that project's fleet.
Concerns
The Concerns tab lists active security concerns that GKE
discovers when scanning your clusters and workloads. This page only displays
concerns for the security posture features described in
Cluster-specific feature enablement in this document.
If you use fleets with GKE, you can see concerns for
fleet member clusters and for standalone GKE clusters that the
selected project owns.
Severity ratings
Where applicable, GKE assigns a severity rating to discovered
concerns. You can use these ratings to determine the urgency with which you need
to resolve the finding. GKE uses the following severity ratings,
which are based on the
CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale :
Critical : Act immediately. An attack will lead to an incident.
High : Act promptly. An attack will very likely lead to an incident.
Medium : Act soon. An attack will likely lead to an incident.
Low : Act eventually. An attack could lead to an incident.
The precise speed of your response to concerns depends on your organization's
threat model and risk tolerance. The severity ratings are a qualitative
guideline to help you to develop a thorough incident response plan.
Concerns table
The Concerns table shows all the concerns detected by
GKE. You can change the default view to group results
by the type of concern, Kubernetes namespace, or by the affected workloads. You can
use the filter pane to filter the results by severity rating, type of concern,
Google Cloud location, and cluster name. To view details about a specific
concern, click the name of that concern.
Concern details pane
When you click a concern in the Concerns table, the concern details pane
opens. This pane provides a detailed description of the concern, and relevant
information such as affected OS versions for vulnerabilities, CVE links, or
risks associated with a specific configuration concern. The details pane
provides a recommended action if applicable. For example, a workload that sets
runAsNonRoot: false would return the recommended change you need to make to
the Pod specification to mitigate the concern.
The Affected resources tab in the concern details pane shows a list of
workloads in your enrolled clusters that are affected by that concern.
Settings
The Settings tab lets you configure cluster-specific security posture features,
like workload configuration auditing, on
eligible GKE clusters in your project or fleet. You can view the
enablement status of specific features for each cluster and change that
configuration for eligible clusters. If you use fleets with
GKE, you can also see whether your fleet member
clusters have the same settings as the fleet-level configuration.
Example workflow
This section is an example of the workflow for a cluster administrator who wants
to scan workloads in a cluster for security configuration issues, such as root
privileges.
Enroll the cluster in Kubernetes security posture scanning by using the
Google Cloud console.
Check the security posture dashboard for scan results, which might
take up to 30 minutes to appear.
Click the Concerns tab to open the detailed results.
Select the Configuration concern type filter.
Click a concern in the table.
On the concern details pane, note the recommended configuration change and
update the Pod specification with the recommendation.
Apply the updated Pod specification to the cluster.
The next time that the scan runs, the security posture dashboard no longer
displays the concern that you fixed.
