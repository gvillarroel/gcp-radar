Access scopes in GKE

This page describes the default access scopes granted to nodes in
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. By reading this page, you learn about
the default access scopes that are granted to clusters, and how you can configure
custom access scopes, if required.
This page is for Security specialists and Operators who
create and manage clusters, and must understand the default access that is granted
to clusters and how to modify that access if needed.
To learn more about
common roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
What are access scopes?
Access scopes are the legacy method of granting permissions for your nodes, and
for workloads running on your nodes if the workloads use
application default credentials (ADC) .
Access scopes define the OAuth scopes used in API calls from client libraries or the
gcloud CLI.
We recommend that you don't specify your own access scopes. Instead, you should
use
IAM permissions
or
Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC)
to grant access to specific IAM service accounts or Kubernetes
service accounts.
Default access scopes
When you create a new GKE cluster, Google Cloud assigns a
default set of access scopes to nodes based on the service account used by the
nodes. These access scopes enable specific functionality for GKE.
You can also set access scopes manually using the --scopes flag when you
create
Standard clusters ,
Autopilot clusters ,
or node pools . You
can't modify the access scopes on existing node pools. Instead, create a new
node pool with the new scopes and migrate workloads to that node pool.
The following sections describe the default access scopes that GKE
adds to nodes based on whether you specify a custom service account, and whether
you manually specify access scopes.

Configure a custom service account for workloads
IAM is the access control
system for granting authorized roles to users and service accounts within your
Google Cloud project. A service account is a
special Google Account that performs tasks, such as deploying applications, on
your behalf.
You use IAM to create a service account, then use
IAM policy bindings to secure the account.
If your workloads require access to Compute Engine, grant the service
account
the Compute Engine Admin role.
If your workloads need to pull private images from Artifact Registry, see
Configuring access control for Artifact Registry repositories .
Create a service account
To create a custom service account named kubernetes-engine-node-sa , run the
following commands:
export NODE_SA_NAME = kubernetes-engine-node-sa
gcloud iam service-accounts create $NODE_SA_NAME \
--display-name "GKE Node Service Account"
export NODE_SA_EMAIL = ` gcloud iam service-accounts list --format = 'value(email)' \
--filter = 'displayName:GKE Node Service Account' `
Note: These commands export two variables, $NODE_SA_NAME and $NODE_SA_EMAIL ,
that are used in commands documented later on this page.
Grant minimal roles
To configure the service account with the minimal necessary roles and
permissions for your GKE node to function, run the following
commands, where $PROJECT is your
project ID :
export PROJECT = ` gcloud config get-value project `
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
--member serviceAccount: $NODE_SA_EMAIL \
--role roles/monitoring.metricWriter
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
--member serviceAccount: $NODE_SA_EMAIL \
--role roles/monitoring.viewer
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
--member serviceAccount: $NODE_SA_EMAIL \
--role roles/logging.logWriter
Grant additional roles
Caution: The compute.admin role shouldn't be granted to this service account
unless necessary. Granting this role allows workloads to create, delete, read
metadata on, and access nodes using SSH, among other operations.
To grant the service account the Compute Engine Admin
role, run the following command:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
--member serviceAccount: $NODE_SA_EMAIL \
--role roles/compute.admin
To learn how to grant service accounts access to private images stored in
Artifact Registry, see Granting access to Google Kubernetes Engine clusters .
Create a cluster or node pool with the custom service account
To create a cluster that uses the custom service account, run the following
command:
gcloud container clusters create --service-account = $NODE_SA_EMAIL
To create a node pool in an existing cluster:
gcloud container node-pools create --service-account = $NODE_SA_EMAIL
Note: You can also find the service
account's email address by running the following command:
gcloud iam service-accounts list --format='value(email)' \
--filter='displayName:Node Service Account'
