Autopilot
Standard
This page helps you to choose the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) mode of operation
that's the best fit for your requirements. This information is intended for the
following people:
Application developers who want to run containerized workloads optimally
based on workload requirements.
Platform administrators who want to know about the recommended methods to use
GKE.
If you want to learn about whether GKE as a platform is the
best choice for your containerized applications, refer to the
GKE overview
and
GKE and Cloud Run .
Introduction to Autopilot mode and Standard mode
GKE lets you choose one of the following modes of operation ,
which determines factors like who manages the infrastructure, how you're billed
for resources, and how much flexibility you have:
Autopilot (recommended) : a managed experience in which
GKE handles most of your infrastructure for you so that you
can focus on your applications. Autopilot is optimized for most
production scenarios and implements many of Google's best practices for
security, scaling, and workloads.
For more information, see
About GKE Autopilot .
Standard : a flexible experience in which you have direct
control over your node infrastructure and autoscaling.
You can use either of these modes of operation to run your GKE
workloads or to operate entire GKE clusters, as described in the
following sections.
Autopilot and Standard mode for workloads
Best Practice :
Use Autopilot for most workloads, unless your application requires
privileges or configuration options that don't meet the Autopilot
constraints.
You can run your workloads in Autopilot or Standard, depending
on your use case and on the requirements of the workload. The following
table describes the differences between Autopilot workloads and
and Standard workloads:
Table 1. Comparison of Autopilot and Standard workloads
Autopilot workloads
Standard workloads
Ideal for most production workloads.
Ideal for workloads that require special privileges, or for when you
need granular control over your workload infrastructure.
GKE provisions compute resources based on your
Kubernetes workload specifications.
You manage resource allocation and the placement of Pods on specific
nodes.
Autopilot workloads can use the Autopilot
container-optimized compute platform ,
which is a scalable, cost-efficient platform that works well for most
general-purpose workloads.
You must plan the capacity of nodes in Standard node pools
based on your workload requirements. You must also configure settings for
scaling your node sizes and quantity.
GKE maximizes node resource usage by
bin-packing
Pods onto nodes.
You plan workload placement based on the size of the nodes that you
create. To minimize wasted node resources, you must also manage effective
bin-packing of Pods.
GKE applies many best practice configurations and
constraints by default, such as preventing privileged Pods.
You can configure Pods in any way that you want, such as by enabling
privileged mode.
You can run Autopilot workloads in Autopilot
clusters or
in Standard clusters .
You can run Standard workloads in only Standard
clusters.
Workloads run in Autopilot or Standard mode depending on
the workload and cluster configuration, as follows:
Autopilot workloads : if your cluster is an Autopilot
cluster, every workload runs in Autopilot mode. If your cluster
is a Standard cluster, you can
run specific workloads in Autopilot mode .
Standard workloads : if you create a workload in a
Standard cluster, the workload uses Standard mode unless
Autopilot mode is selected for that workload.
About Autopilot workloads in Standard clusters
You can run workloads in Autopilot mode in your Standard
clusters, which lets you have granular control over your cluster settings and
node pool infrastructure while also getting many of the automation, scaling, and
pricing benefits of Autopilot for a subset of your applications.
Run Autopilot workloads in Standard clusters when you
need the flexibility of a Standard mode cluster, but you also have
workloads that can benefit from the cost-efficiency and automation of
Autopilot mode.
To run Autopilot workloads in a Standard cluster, you use a
compute class , which is a GKE feature that lets you
declaratively control node configuration options during scaling.
GKE manages bin-packing, resource scaling, and the underlying
infrastructure for the Autopilot workloads that you run in your
Standard cluster.
For more information, see
About Autopilot workloads in GKE Standard .
Autopilot and Standard mode for clusters
To run workloads in GKE, you create a GKE cluster.
Similarly to selecting a mode for your workloads, you can use Autopilot
or Standard mode to operate your entire cluster. The mode that you use
for the cluster affects how much flexibility and control you have over your
infrastructure and cluster settings, as follows:
Table 2. Comparison of cluster modes
Autopilot clusters
Standard clusters
GKE manages the cluster infrastructure, including nodes
and scaling. GKE configures various settings by default,
such as security constraints.
You control the cluster infrastructure and can change most settings.
In Standard clusters, you can configure your own
node pools , which are groups of nodes that share characteristics.
You also configure node settings, security policies and constraints, and
scaling.
Autopilot clusters are pre-configured with Google's best
practices and run only Autopilot workloads.
Standard clusters can run both Autopilot and
Standard workloads.
For more information about the detailed differences between Autopilot
and Standard clusters, see
Compare features in Autopilot and Standard clusters .
Unless you require the granular control and flexibility of Standard
clusters, we recommend that you use Autopilot clusters. For an
interactive walkthrough that sets up an Autopilot cluster and creates a
hello-world application, go to the Autopilot walkthrough in the
Google Cloud console:

Pricing
In GKE, the mode of operation that you use affects the charges
that you incur. For more information, see
Google Kubernetes Engine pricing .
