Autopilot
Standard
This page shows you how to disable the insecure kubelet read-only port in
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to
the kubelet, and how to migrate applications to a more secure port.
In Kubernetes clusters, including GKE, the kubelet process
running on nodes serves a read-only API using the insecure port 10255 .
Kubernetes doesn't perform any authentication or authorization checks on this
port. The kubelet serves the same endpoints on the more secure, authenticated
port 10250 .
Disable the kubelet read-only port and switch any workloads that use port
10255 to use the more secure port 10250 instead.
Note: The kubelet read-only port is disabled by default in new clusters that run
version 1.32 or later.
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure that you have performed the following tasks:
Enable
the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
Enable Google Kubernetes Engine API
If you want to use the Google Cloud CLI for this task,
install and then
initialize the
gcloud CLI. If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest
version by running the gcloud components update command. Earlier gcloud CLI versions might not support running the commands in this document.
Note: For existing gcloud CLI
installations, make sure to set the compute/region property . If you use primarily zonal clusters, set the compute/zone instead. By setting a default location,
you can avoid errors in the gcloud CLI like the following:
One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location . You might need to specify the location in certain commands if the location of your cluster differs from the default that you set.
Ensure that you have an existing Autopilot or Standard
cluster. To create a new cluster, see
Create an Autopilot cluster .
Requirements
You can only disable the insecure kubelet read-only port in GKE
version 1.26.4-gke.500 or later.
Check for insecure port usage and migrate applications
Before you disable the insecure read-only port, migrate any of your running
applications that use the port to the more secure read-only port. Workloads that
might need migration include custom metrics pipelines and workloads that
access kubelet endpoints.
For workloads that need access to the information served by the kubelet API
on the node, like metrics, use port 10250 .
For workloads that get Kubernetes information using the kubelet API on the
node, like listing Pods on the node, use the Kubernetes API instead.
Check whether applications use the insecure kubelet read-only port
This section shows you how to check for insecure port usage in your cluster.
Check for port usage on Autopilot mode
To check for port usage in an Autopilot cluster, ensure that you have
at least one workload that isn't a DaemonSet running in the cluster. If you
perform the following steps on an empty Autopilot cluster, the results
might be invalid.
Save the following manifest as read-only-port-metrics.yaml :
# Create a namespace for the DaemonSet that checks for port usage.
apiVersion : v1
kind : Namespace
metadata :
name : node-metrics-printer-namespace
---

This manifest does the following:
Creates a namespace and sets up RBAC roles to allow reading node
metrics.
Deploys a DaemonSet that checks the kubelet metrics for the
insecure read-only port.
Deploy the manifest:
kubectl create -f read-only-port-metrics.yaml
Check the DaemonSet logs:
kubectl logs --namespace = node-metrics-printer-namespace \
--all-containers --prefix \
--selector = app = node-metrics-printer
If the output has any results that contain the string server_type=readonly ,
an application is using the insecure read-only port.
Check for port usage on Standard mode
Run the following command on at least one node in every node pool in your
cluster:
kubectl get --raw /api/v1/nodes/ NODE_NAME /proxy/metrics | grep http_requests_total | grep readonly
Replace NODE_NAME with the name of the node.
If the output contains entries with the server_type="readonly" string, then the following scenarios can occur:
Workloads on the node use the insecure kubelet read-only port.
After disabling the insecure port, the command still returns the server_type="readonly" string. This is because the kubelet_http_requests_total metric represents the cumulative number of HTTP requests received by the kubelet server since its last restart.
This number is not reset when the insecure port is disabled. This number is reset after GKE restarts the kubelet server, such as during a node upgrade. To learn more, see Kubernetes Metrics Reference .
If the output is empty, no workloads on that node use the insecure
read-only port.
Identify the workloads that are using the insecure kubelet read-only port
To identify the workloads that are using the insecure port, check the workload's configuration files such as ConfigMaps and Pods.
Run the following commands:
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o yaml | grep 10255
kubectl get configmaps --all-namespaces -o yaml | grep 10255
If the output of the command is not empty, use the following script to identify the names of the ConfigMaps or Pods that are using the insecure port:
# This function checks if a Kubernetes resource is using the insecure port 10255.
#
# Arguments:
# $1 - Resource type (e.g., pod, configmap, )
# $2 - Resource name
# $3 - Namespace
#
# Output:
# Prints a message indicating whether the resource is using the insecure port.
isUsingInsecurePort () {
resource_type = $1
resource_name = $2
namespace = $3
config = $( kubectl get $resource_type $resource_name -n $namespace -o yaml )
# Check if kubectl output is empty
if [[ -z " $config " ]] ; then
echo "No configuration file detected for $resource_type : $resource_name (Namespace: $namespace )"
return
fi
if echo " $config " | grep -q "10255" ; then
echo "Warning: The configuration file ( $resource_type : $namespace / $resource_name ) is using insecure port 10255. It is recommended to migrate to port 10250 for enhanced security."
else
echo "Info: The configuration file ( $resource_type : $namespace / $resource_name ) is not using insecure port 10255."
fi
}
# Get the list of ConfigMaps with their namespaces
configmaps = $( kubectl get configmaps -A -o custom-columns = NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name | tail -n +2 | awk '{print $1"/"$2}' )
# Iterate over each ConfigMap
for configmap in $configmaps ; do
namespace = $( echo $configmap | cut -d/ -f1 )
configmap_name = $( echo $configmap | cut -d/ -f2 )
isUsingInsecurePort "configmap" " $configmap_name " " $namespace "
done
# Get the list of Pods with their namespaces
pods = $( kubectl get pods -A -o custom-columns = NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name | tail -n +2 | awk '{print $1"/"$2}' )
# Iterate over each Pod
for pod in $pods ; do
namespace = $( echo $pod | cut -d/ -f1 )
pod_name = $( echo $pod | cut -d/ -f2 )
isUsingInsecurePort "pod" " $pod_name " " $namespace "
done
Once you've identified the relevant workloads, migrate them to use the secure port 10250 by completing the steps in the following section.
Migrate from the insecure kubelet read-only port
Typically, migrating an application to the secure port involves the following
steps:
Update URLs or endpoints that refer to the insecure read-only port to use
the secure read-only port instead. For
example, change http://203.0.113.104:10255 to http://203.0.113.104:10250 .
Set the certificate authority (CA) certificate of the HTTP client to the
cluster CA certificate. To find this certificate, run the following
command:
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--format = "value(masterAuth.clusterCaCertificate)"
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your cluster.
LOCATION : the location of your cluster.
The authenticated port 10250 requires that you grant appropriate RBAC
roles to the subject to access the specific resources. For details, in the
Kubernetes documentation, see
kubelet authorization .
If your workload uses the /pods endpoint on the insecure kubelet read-only
port, you need to grant the nodes/proxy RBAC permission to access the endpoint
on the secure kubelet port. nodes/proxy is a powerful permission that you
can't grant in GKE Autopilot clusters and that you
shouldn't grant in GKE Standard clusters. Use the
Kubernetes API with a fieldSelector
for the node name instead.
If you use third-party applications that depend on the insecure kubelet
read-only port, check with the application vendor for instructions to migrate
to secure port 10250 .
Example migration
Consider a Pod that queries metrics from the insecure kubelet read-only port.
apiVersion : v1
kind : Pod
metadata :
name : kubelet-readonly-example
spec :
restartPolicy : Never
containers :
- name : kubelet-readonly-example
image : us-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-builders/ga/v1/curl:latest
command :
- curl
- http://${NODE_ADDRESS}:10255/metrics
env :
- name : NODE_ADDRESS
valueFrom :
fieldRef :
fieldPath : status.hostIP
This application does the following:
Uses the default ServiceAccount in the default namespace
Runs the curl command against the /metrics endpoint on the node.
To update this Pod to use the secure port 10250 , do the following steps:
Create a ClusterRole with access to get node metrics:
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : ClusterRole
metadata :
name : curl-authenticated-role
rules :
# Grant access to read node metrics in the cluster.
- apiGroups :
- ""
resources :
- nodes/metrics
verbs :
- get
Bind the ClusterRole to your application's identity:
apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind : ClusterRoleBinding
metadata :
name : curl-authenticated-role-binding
roleRef :
apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io
kind : ClusterRole
name : curl-authenticated-role
# Bind the ClusterRole to the default ServiceAccount in the default
# namespace.
subjects :
- kind : ServiceAccount
name : default
namespace : default
Update the curl command to use the secure port endpoint with the
corresponding authorization headers:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Pod
metadata :
name : kubelet-authenticated-example
spec :
restartPolicy : Never
containers :
- name : kubelet-readonly-example
image : us-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-builders/ga/v1/curl:latest
env :
- name : NODE_ADDRESS
valueFrom :
fieldRef :
fieldPath : status.hostIP
# Update the command to send a request with the ServiceAccount
# credentials in the header.
command :
- sh
- -c
- 'curl -s --cacert /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt -H "Authorization:
Bearer $(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)" https://${NODE_ADDRESS}:10250/metrics'
Modify VPC firewall rules
If you update workloads to use port 10250 , create firewall rules so that Pods
in the cluster can reach the port in your node IP address ranges. The firewall
rules should do the following:
Allow incoming traffic to TCP port 10250 on your node IP address ranges
from internal Pod IP address ranges
Deny incoming traffic to TCP port 10250 on your node IP address ranges from
the public internet.
Caution: Don't modify the default firewall rules that GKE creates
in your clusters. Create new rules for the secure port. Modifying the default
rules might result in unexpected behavior in your workloads.
You can use the following
default GKE firewall rules
as a template for the parameters to specify in your new rules:
gke-[cluster-name]-[cluster-hash]-inkubelet
gke-[cluster-name]-[cluster-hash]-exkubelet
Disable the insecure read-only port on Autopilot clusters
You can disable the insecure kubelet read-only port for new and existing
Autopilot clusters.
To disable the insecure kubelet read-only port on an Autopilot
cluster, use the
--no-autoprovisioning-enable-insecure-kubelet-readonly-port flag, like in the
following command. All new and existing nodes in the cluster stop using the
port.
Caution: This command starts a rolling update of all the nodes in your cluster,
which might cause disruptions in running workloads.
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--no-autoprovisioning-enable-insecure-kubelet-readonly-port
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your existing
cluster.
LOCATION : the location of your existing
cluster.
You can also use the
--no-autoprovisioning-enable-insecure-kubelet-readonly-port flag when you
create a new cluster by using the
gcloud container clusters create-auto command.
Disable the insecure read-only port on Standard clusters
You can disable the insecure kubelet read-only port for entire Standard
clusters or for individual node pools. We recommend that you disable the port
for the entire cluster.
If you use node auto-provisioning, automatically provisioned node pools inherit
the port setting that you specify at the cluster level. You can optionally
specify a different setting for auto-provisioned node pools, but we recommend
that you disable the port across all nodes in your cluster.
You can also use a
node system configuration file
to declaratively disable the insecure kubelet read-only port. If you use this
file, you can't use the commands in the following sections to control the
kubelet setting.
Disable the insecure read-only port on existing Standard clusters
To disable the insecure kubelet read-only port on an existing Standard
cluster, use the --no-enable-insecure-kubelet-readonly-port flag like in the
following command. Any new node pools won't use the insecure port.
GKE doesn't update existing node pools automatically.
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--no-enable-insecure-kubelet-readonly-port
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your existing Standard
cluster.
LOCATION : the location of your existing Standard
cluster.
You can also use the
--no-autoprovisioning-enable-insecure-kubelet-readonly-port flag when you
create a new cluster by using the
gcloud container clusters create command.
Disable the insecure read-only port on Standard node pools
We recommend that you set the read-only port setting at the cluster level in all
cases. If you disabled the read-only port on an existing cluster that already
had running node pools, use the following command to disable the port on those
node pools.
Caution: This command starts a rolling update of the nodes in that node pool,
which might cause disruptions in running workloads.
gcloud container node-pools update NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--no-enable-insecure-kubelet-readonly-port
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : the name of your node pool.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
LOCATION : the location of the cluster.
Verify that the port is disabled
To verify that the insecure kubelet read-only port is disabled, describe the
GKE resource.
Check the port status in Autopilot clusters
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--flatten = nodePoolAutoConfig \
--format = "value(nodeKubeletConfig)"
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your Autopilot
cluster.
LOCATION : the location of your Autopilot
cluster.
If the port is disabled, the output is the following:
insecureKubeletReadonlyPortEnabled: false
Check the port status in Standard clusters
The port status is available in the
nodePoolDefaults.nodeConfigDefaults.nodeKubeletConfig field when you describe
your cluster using the GKE API.
In Standard clusters, you'll also see a nodeConfig field that sets a
value for the kubelet read-only port status. The nodeConfig field is
deprecated and applies only to the default node pool that GKE
creates when you create a new Standard mode cluster. The status of the
port in the deprecated nodeConfig field doesn't apply to other node pools
in the cluster.
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--flatten = nodePoolDefaults.nodeConfigDefaults \
--format = "value(nodeKubeletConfig)"
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your Standard
cluster.
LOCATION : the location of your Standard
cluster.
If the port is disabled, the output is the following:
insecureKubeletReadonlyPortEnabled: false
If the output of this command is blank, the insecure kubelet read-only port
might still be enabled. To disable the port, run the command in the
Disable the insecure read-only port on existing Standard clusters
section.
Check the port status in Standard node pools
Run the following command:
gcloud container node-pools describe NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--flatten = config \
--format = "value(kubeletConfig)"
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : the name of your node pool.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster.
LOCATION : the location of the cluster.
If the port is disabled, the output is the following:
insecureKubeletReadonlyPortEnabled: false
Prevent insecure port usage with an organization policy
You can use Organization Policy Service to enforce that clusters in your organization,
folder, or project must disable the insecure kubelet read-only port. To
enforce this requirement, you create a
custom constraint ,
and then reference that constraint in an organization policy. To deny creation
or update operations when the insecure kubelet read-only port is enabled,
see these examples:
The following custom constraint denies cluster creation or update operations
if the insecure kubelet read-only port is enabled:
name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID /customConstraints/custom.disableClusterInsecureKubeletReadOnlyPort
resourceTypes :
- container.googleapis.com/Cluster
methodTypes :
- CREATE
- UPDATE
condition :
"resource.NodeKubeletConfig.insecureKubeletReadonlyPortEnabled == true ||
resource.AutoprovisioningNodePoolDefaults.insecureKubeletReadonlyPortEnabled == true ||
resource.NodePoolAutoConfig.NodeKubeletConfig.insecureKubeletReadonlyPortEnabled == true"
actionType : DENY
displayName : Disable insecure kubelet read-only port
description : All new and existing clusters must disable the insecure kubelet read-only port.
Replace ORGANIZATION_ID with your organization ID.
The following custom constraint denies node pool creation or update operations
if the insecure kubelet read-only port is enabled:
name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID /customConstraints/custom.disableNodePoolInsecureKubeletReadOnlyPort
resourceTypes :
- container.googleapis.com/NodePool
methodTypes :
- CREATE
- UPDATE
condition : "resource.NodeConfig.NodeKubeletConfig.insecureKubeletReadonlyPortEnabled == true"
actionType : DENY
displayName : Disable insecure kubelet read-only port
description : All new and existing node pools must disable the insecure kubelet read-only port.
Replace ORGANIZATION_ID with your organization ID.
