Autopilot
Standard
This page shows you how to dynamically apply network tags
to nodes in your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. Network tags
let you make firewall rules and allow routes to specific VM instances without
disrupting running workloads. On this page, you learn how to apply and update
network tags.
This page is for Security specialists who use network tags to apply
firewall rules to their nodes.
This page provides essential information about available authentication methods and how to implement them. To learn more about
common roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Before reading this page, ensure that you're familiar with the general overview of network tags .
About network tags
Network tags are metadata on Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs) that
allow you to make firewall rules and routes applicable to specific VM instances.
In GKE, you can use network tags to make VPC
firewall rules or routes applicable to the nodes in your cluster.
You can use the GKE API to apply and update network tags on your
GKE clusters without disrupting running
workloads. Network tags that you specify are also applied to any new nodes that
GKE automatically provisions.
Use Tags instead of network tags
Network tags are simple strings that aren't subject to Identity and Access Management access
controls. Anyone with access to your nodes in the GKE API can
add network tags to those nodes.
If you use GKE version 1.28 or later, we recommend that you
use Tags that have a firewall designation to enforce regional or
global network firewall policies ,
which improve on the capabilities of VPC firewall rules.
Tags are key-value pairs that you attach to Compute Engine
VMs. You can use IAM to control who can interact with
specific Tags.
To use Tags to enforce firewall policies in
GKE, see
Selectively enforce network firewall policies in GKE .
For more benefits of Tags, see
Comparison of Tags and network tags .
For help with migrating your firewall rules to network firewall policies, see
Google Cloud VPC firewall rules to network firewall policies - migration guide (PDF) .
Command-line options for applying network tags
The following table describes the flags that you can specify using the
Google Cloud CLI to apply network tags to your clusters, as well as their use
cases.
Flag
Mode of operation
Level
Description
--autoprovisioning-network-tags
Autopilot
Standard
Cluster
Applies the specified network tags to all Autopilot nodes and
all auto-provisioned Standard node pools.
--tags
Standard
Node pool
Manually applies network tags to specific Standard node pools.
Note: If you used
--autoprovisioning-network-tags to apply network tags to
auto-provisioned node pools, GKE prevents you from using
--tags for those node pools
Limitations
Using --autoprovisioning-network-tags prevents you from using --tags to update
the network tags for auto-provisioned Standard node pools.
We recommend that you use --autoprovisioning-network-tags for auto-provisioned
node pools, and that you use --tags only for manually-created node pools.
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure that you have performed the following tasks:
Enable
the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
Enable Google Kubernetes Engine API
If you want to use the Google Cloud CLI for this task,
install and then
initialize the
gcloud CLI. If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest
version by running the gcloud components update command. Earlier gcloud CLI versions might not support running the commands in this document.
Note: For existing gcloud CLI
installations, make sure to set the compute/region property . If you use primarily zonal clusters, set the compute/zone instead. By setting a default location,
you can avoid errors in the gcloud CLI like the following:
One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location . You might need to specify the location in certain commands if the location of your cluster differs from the default that you set.
Add network tags to new clusters
You can add network tags when you create a new cluster.
Add network tags to new Autopilot clusters
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters create-auto CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--autoprovisioning-network-tags = TAG1,TAG2,...
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your new Autopilot
cluster.
LOCATION : the Compute Engine location
for your new cluster.
TAG1,TAG2, ... : a comma-separated list of the network
tags you want to apply.
Add network tags to new Standard clusters
For Standard, you can also specify
network tags specifically for node auto-provisioning to use.
Apply network tags to the default node pool
Run the following command to create a new Standard cluster and apply
network tags to the default node pool:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--tags = NETWORK_TAG1,NETWORK_TAG2,...
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your new Standard
cluster.
COMPUTE_REGION : the Compute Engine location
for your new cluster.
NETWORK_TAG1,NETWORK_TAG2, ... : a comma-separated list of the network
tags that you want to apply.
Apply network tags to auto-provisioned node pools
You can automatically apply network tags to all node pools that are created by
node auto-provisioning.
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--enable-autoprovisioning \
--autoprovisioning-network-tags = TAG1,TAG2,...
Replace TAG1,TAG2,... with a comma-separated
list of network tags that you want applied to all autoprovisioned node pools.
Note: Using --autoprovisioning-network-tags prevents you from later using
--tags to manually update network tags on auto-provisioned node pools.
Update network tags on existing clusters
You can update the network tags on existing clusters.
Caution: This overwrites any previously specified values for network tags.
Update network tags on existing Autopilot clusters
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--autoprovisioning-network-tags = TAG1,TAG2,...
Update network tags on existing Standard clusters
Run the following command to update the network tags on a specific Standard
node pool. You cannot use this command to update auto-provisioned node pools
if you used --autoprovisioning-network-tags .
gcloud container node-pools update NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--tags = NETWORK_TAG1,NETWORK_TAG2,...
If --autoprovisioning-network-tags is set for the cluster, this command
returns an error.
Note: We recommend that you use --autoprovisioning-network-tags to specify
network tags for auto-provisioned node pools. If you want to manually
update the network tags for those node pools, you must first remove existing
auto-provisioning network tags .
Update network tags for auto-provisioned node pools
You can update the network tags that node auto-provisioning applies to
new and existing auto-provisioned node pools.
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--autoprovisioning-network-tags = TAG1,TAG2,...
Note: Using --autoprovisioning-network-tags prevents you from later using
--tags to update network tags on auto-provisioned node pools.
Add network tags to new Standard node pools
To create a new node pool in a Standard clusters with specific network
tags, run the following command:
gcloud container node-pools create NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--tags = NETWORK_TAG1,NETWORK_TAG2,...
Replace NODE_POOL_NAME with the name of the new node
pool.
View existing network tags
This section shows you how to view your existing network tags.
View existing network tags in Autopilot
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--flatten = nodePoolAutoConfig.networkTags
If the cluster has network tags, the output is similar to the following:
---
tags:
- example-tag
View existing network tags in Standard
You can view network tags in auto-provisioned node pools or in node pools that
you created.
View network tags in auto-provisioned node pools
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--flatten = nodePoolAutoConfig.networkTags
If the cluster has network tags, the output is similar to the following:
---
tags:
- example-tag
View network tags in node pools without node auto-provisioning
To view the network tags for a specific Standard node pool where
applied the tags using the --tags flag, run the following command:
gcloud container node-pools describe NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--format = 'value(config.tags)'
Replace NODE_POOL_NAME with the name of the node
pool.
If the node pool has tags, the output is similar to the following:
example-tag
Remove network tags
You can remove the network tags from GKE.
Remove network tags from Autopilot clusters
Run the following command:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--autoprovisioning-network-tags = ""
Remove network tags from Standard clusters and node pools
You can remove tags from all auto-provisioned node pools or from specific
node pools.
Remove network tags from auto-provisioned node pools
To remove network tags from all auto-provisioned node pools, run the following
command:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--autoprovisioning-network-tags = ""
This command also restores your ability to use the --tags option to manually
specify network tags for auto-provisioned node pools.
Remove network tags from specific node pools
To remove network tags from specific node pools, run the
following command:
gcloud container node-pools update NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster = CLUSTER_NAME \
--tags = ""
