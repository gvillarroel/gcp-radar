Autopilot
This page describes the security features, configurations, and settings in
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot mode. This information is for
Security specialists who want to understand the security constraints that
Google applies in Autopilot mode, and the security features that are
available for use in Autopilot. To learn more about common roles and
example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Before reading this page, familiarize yourself with the following:
General overview of GKE security
General overview of Autopilot mode and Standard mode
Terminology
In GKE, you can use Autopilot by creating an
Autopilot cluster or by running a workload in an Autopilot
ComputeClass in any Standard cluster. This page describes security
measures for Autopilot in both of these situations by using the
following terminology:
Autopilot cluster
The entire cluster uses Autopilot mode.
Autopilot workloads in Standard clusters
The cluster uses Standard mode, and you run specific workloads in
Autopilot by using ComputeClasses.
Security measures in Autopilot
Best practice : Use Autopilot clusters
for comprehensive enforcement of the Autopilot security measures.
GKE applies various security best practices and settings by
default in Autopilot mode, including many of the recommendations in the
security overview and in
Harden your cluster security .
In Autopilot clusters, GKE strictly enforces all of the
measures on this page by default. This default configuration makes
Autopilot clusters the recommended way to use GKE.
For Autopilot workloads in Standard clusters,
GKE enforces the security measures in the following sections on a
best-effort basis .
Enforcement of Kubernetes Pod Security Standards
The Kubernetes project has a set of security guidelines named the
Pod Security Standards that define the following policies:
Privileged : No access restrictions. Not used in Autopilot.
Baseline : Prevents known privilege escalation pathways. Allows most
workloads to run without significant changes.
Restricted : Highest level of security. Requires significant changes to
most workloads.
In Autopilot mode, GKE enforces Pod security constraints
by using Kubernetes admission controllers. The default Autopilot Pod
admission policy includes all of the recommendations in the Baseline level of
the Pod Security Standards, with some modifications for usability. Additionally,
the default admission policy includes many constraints from the Restricted level
of the Pod Security Standards, but avoids restrictions that would block a
majority of your workloads from running.
To apply additional restrictions to comply with the full Restricted policy, you
can optionally use the
PodSecurity admission controller
in specific namespaces.
The following table describes how the controls in the default Autopilot
admission policy compare to the controls in the Baseline and the Restricted
levels of the Pod Security Standards. For more information about each control in
this table, see the corresponding entry in
Pod Security Standards .
When evaluating compliance, we considered how the constraints apply to your own
workloads. This excludes verified Google Cloud partner workloads and
system workloads that require specific privileges to function.

Additional information
HostProcess
Autopilot blocks HostProcess.
Host namespaces
Autopilot blocks host namespaces. Some containers from
verified partners
are allowed to use host namespaces.
Privileged containers
Autopilot blocks privileged containers by default.
Autopilot allows privileged containers from verified partners for
purposes such as running security and monitoring tooling.
Linux capabilities
Autopilot workloads can only access the capabilities specified
in the Baseline Pod Security Standard by default.
You can manually enable the following capabilities:
NET_RAW for ping and SYS_PTRACE for debugging:
Add to Pod SecurityContext
NET_ADMIN for service meshes such as Istio: Specify
--workload-policies=allow-net-admin in your cluster creation
command.
Autopilot also allows some verified partner workloads to
set dropped capabilities.
HostPath volumes
Partially complies
Partially complies
Autopilot allows containers to request read-only access to
/var/log for debugging, but denies all other read or write
access.
HostPorts
Setting specific host ports is disallowed, which mitigates some
scheduling issues ,
and prevents accidental or deliberate direct network exposure of services.
You can manually set up
random host port assignment
from a known range to support direct-connection networking applications
such as game servers.
AppArmor
The AppArmor docker-default security profile is
automatically applied to Container-Optimized OS .
SELinux
SELinux isn't applied because AppArmor is already applied. SELinux is
also not mandatory in the Pod Security Standards.
/proc mount type
In GKE version 1.33 and later, if the Pod
securityContext sets procMount to Unmasked ,
Autopilot rejects the Pod. In versions earlier than 1.33,
Autopilot automatically overwrites the value in the
procMount field to Default .
seccomp profile
Autopilot applies the RuntimeDefault seccomp
profile to all workloads. You can manually override this setting for
specific workloads by setting the profile to Unconfined in
the Pod specification.
sysctls
GKE does not set the --allowed-unsafe-sysctls kubelet flag so
pods with unsafe sysctls fail to schedule. For additional protection, as of 11 July 2023, new 1.27+
clusters also have a policy rule to enforce the securityContext settings and reject Pods
that use unsafe sysctls.
Volume types
Autopilot allows only the volume types in the Restricted policy with the following additions: HostPath volumes with read-only access to
/var/log for debugging, gcePersistentDisk for Compute Engine
persistent disks, and nfs for network file system volumes.
Privilege escalation
This setting only provides protection to containers that aren't
running as root. Industry surveys show that 76% of containers run as root,
so Autopilot allows running as root to enable most workloads.
This setting is also useful in de-privileging workloads
to non-root by allowing use of file system capabilities to work around
deficiencies with Kubernetes root capability handling .
Run as non-root
Industry surveys
show that 76% of containers run as root, so
Autopilot allows running as root to enable most workloads.
Run as non-root user
Containers can set runAsUser to 0 .
Industry surveys
show that 76% of containers run as root, so
Autopilot allows running as root to enable most workloads
Built-in security configurations
In addition to the Pod Security Standards, Google applies many security settings
in Autopilot based on industry best practices and our expertise. These
built-in security configurations are strictly applied in Autopilot
clusters.
In Standard clusters, GKE automatically applies many of
these configurations on a best-effort basis to Autopilot workloads in
the cluster. You can optionally apply all of these configurations in your
Standard cluster by
enabling every Autopilot policy for that cluster ,
which forces all of the workloads in the Standard cluster to use
Autopilot mode.
The following table describes some of the security configurations that
Autopilot applies for you:
Configuration
Description
Host options
No hostNetwork , because
GKE manages your nodes.
Random hostPort assignment .
No hostPath volumes in write mode. You
can use hostPath volumes in read mode for /var/log/ path prefixes.
No
host namespaces .
Linux capabilities
You can use the following Linux capabilities :
"SETPCAP", "MKNOD", "AUDIT_WRITE", "CHOWN", "DAC_OVERRIDE", "FOWNER", "FSETID", "KILL", "SETGID", "SETUID", "NET_BIND_SERVICE", "SYS_CHROOT", "SETFCAP", "SYS_PTRACE"
You can also manually enable the following capabilities:
NET_RAW for ping: Add to Pod SecurityContext .
SYS_PTRACE for debugging: Add to Pod SecurityContext .
NET_ADMIN for service meshes such as Istio: Use
--workload-policies=allow-net-admin
when you create a cluster or update an existing cluster. After that, add
the capability to the Pod SecurityContext .
This capability grants broad access to network
operations such as write access to routing tables and firewalls. An
attacker could potentially use this access to perform privilege
escalation attacks in your cluster. For
details, see the CAP_NET_ADMIN manpage .
Privileged containers
Containers can't run in Privileged mode unless the container is deployed
by a Google Cloud partner .
Privileged containers can make changes to the underlying node, such as
changing the kubelet. This access could increase the impact of a Pod
compromise.
GKE-managed namespaces
As a security measure, Autopilot doesn't allow deploying
workloads in GKE-managed namespaces, such as
kube-system .
Container isolation
Autopilot enforces the following restrictions on containers
to limit the impact of container escape vulnerabilities.
Linux capabilities and kernel security
Autopilot applies the RuntimeDefault seccomp profile
to all Pods in the cluster unless the Pods use
GKE Sandbox .
GKE Sandbox enforces host isolation and ignores seccomp rules
specified in the Pod manifest. The sandbox is considered the security
boundary for GKE Sandbox Pods.
Autopilot drops the CAP_NET_RAW Linux
capability for all containers. This permission is not often used, and
has been the subject of multiple escape vulnerabilities. The
ping command might fail inside your containers because this
capability is dropped. You can manually re-enable this capability by
setting it in your Pod SecurityContext.
Autopilot drops the CAP_NET_ADMIN Linux
capability for all containers. To re-enable this capability, specify the
--workload-policies=allow-net-admin
flag in your cluster creation or update command. NET_ADMIN is required
by some workloads such as Istio.
Autopilot clusters enable
Workload Identity Federation for GKE ,
which prevents Pod access to sensitive metadata on the node.
Autopilot blocks Kubernetes Services that set the
spec.externalIPs
field to protect against CVE-2020-8554 .
Autopilot allows only the following types of volumes :
"configMap", "csi", "downwardAPI", "emptyDir", "gcePersistentDisk", "nfs", "persistentVolumeClaim", "projected", "secret"
Other types of volumes are blocked because they require node privileges.
HostPath volumes are blocked by default, but containers can request
read-only access to /var/log paths for debugging.
Pod-level security policy enforcement
Autopilot supports enforcement mechanisms for Pod-level
security policies such as the
PodSecurity admission controller ,
Gatekeeper ,
or Policy Controller .
However, you might not need to use any of these if the built-in security
configurations described on this page already meet your requirements.
SSH to nodes
Autopilot blocks SSH access to nodes. GKE
handles all operational aspects of the nodes, including node health and
all Kubernetes components running on the nodes.
You can still connect remotely to your running containers using the Kubernetes
exec functionality to execute commands in your containers for
debugging, including connecting to an interactive shell, for example with
kubectl exec -it deploy/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT -- sh .
User impersonation
Autopilot supports
user impersonation for all user-defined users and groups.
In Autopilot clusters only, system users and groups (like the
kube-apiserver user and the system:masters
group) can't be impersonated. Because user impersonation restrictions
happen in the control plane, this constraint isn't enforced in
Standard clusters, even when workloads use an Autopilot
ComputeClass. We strongly discourage the impersonation of system users
and groups in GKE.
Mutating dynamic admission webhooks
In Autopilot clusters only, GKE modifies
mutating webhooks to exclude resources in managed namespaces, such as
kube-system , from being intercepted.
Because admission control happens in the cluster control plane, this
constraint isn't enforced in Standard clusters, even when
workloads use an Autopilot ComputeClass.
Autopilot also rejects webhooks that specify one or more of
the following resources, and any sub-resources of those resources.
- group: ""
resource: nodes
- group: ""
resource: persistentVolumes
- group: certificates.k8s.io
resource: certificatesigningrequests
- group: authentication.k8s.io
resource: tokenreviews
You can't use the * wildcard for resources or groups to
bypass this restriction.
ValidatingAdmissionPolicies
In Autopilot clusters only, GKE modifies
ValidatingAdmissionPolicy objects to exclude resources in
managed namespaces, such as kube-system ,
from being intercepted. Because admission control happens in the cluster
control plane, this constraint isn't enforced in Standard
clusters, even when workloads use an Autopilot ComputeClass.
Autopilot also rejects ValidatingAdmissionPolicy
objects that specify one or more of the following resources, and any
sub-resources of those resources.
- group: ""
resource: nodes
- group: ""
resource: persistentVolumes
- group: certificates.k8s.io
resource: certificatesigningrequests
- group: authentication.k8s.io
resource: tokenreviews
You can't use the * wildcard for resources or groups to
bypass this restriction.
Certificate signing requests
You can create CertificateSigningRequests in Autopilot to
create certificates that are signed by the cluster certificate authority.
To prevent interference with system components, Autopilot
clusters reject CertificateSigningRequests for known privileged
identities, such as system groups, system agents, or Google-managed
IAM service agents. This constraint doesn't apply in
Standard clusters, which let you create CertificateSigningRequests
for known privileged identities.
GKE security features
Autopilot clusters enable recommended GKE
security features for you. For a list of enabled and optional security
features, refer to security features in Autopilot .
Node operating system
Autopilot uses Container-Optimized OS with
containerd as the node operating system.
Container-Optimized OS is created and managed by Google.
GKE version upgrades
Autopilot clusters are enrolled in a GKE release
channel upon creation, and automatic upgrades are always enabled. Google
automatically upgrades your control plane and nodes to the latest qualified
version in the release channel over time.
Security boundaries in Autopilot
Autopilot provides access to the Kubernetes API but removes permissions
to use some highly privileged Kubernetes features, such as privileged Pods. The
goal is to limit the ability to access, modify, or directly control the node
virtual machine (VM). Autopilot implements these restrictions to limit
workloads from having low-level access to the node VM, so that
Google Cloud can offer full management of nodes, and a Pod-level
SLA .
Important: The security boundary for GKE nodes is the
single-tenant VM. The ability to access the node VM from Pods is not considered
a security boundary for Autopilot. Any node-level access is
inconsistent with the security goals of GKE Autopilot and
is not supported. Google might remove any node-level access without notice.
Our intent is to prevent unintended access to the node VM. We accept submissions
to that effect through the
Google Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP)
and will reward reports at the discretion of the Google VRP reward panel.
By design, privileged users such as cluster administrators have full control of
any GKE cluster. As a security best practice, we recommend that
you avoid granting powerful GKE or Kubernetes privileges widely
and instead use namespace administrator delegation wherever possible as described in our
multi-tenancy guidance .
Autopilot provisions single-tenant VMs in your project for your
exclusive use. On each individual VM, your Autopilot workloads might
run together, sharing a security-hardened kernel. Since the shared kernel
represents a single security boundary, we recommend that if you require strong
isolation, such as high-risk or untrusted workloads, run your workloads on
GKE Sandbox Pods to provide
multi-layer security protection.
Security recommendations based on use case
The following sections provide you with links and recommendations to plan,
implement, and manage the security of your Autopilot clusters depending
on your use case.

Authenticate and authorize
After setting up your Autopilot clusters, you might need to
authenticate your users and applications to use resources such as the Kubernetes
API or Google Cloud APIs.
Use case
Resources
Authenticate users or applications to the cluster API server
To authenticate users, read Authenticating users .
To authenticate applications, read Authenticating applications , which provides steps for authenticating from apps in the same cluster, in other Google Cloud environments, or in external environments.
Authenticate applications to Google Cloud APIs and services
Autopilot clusters let you use Workload Identity Federation for GKE
to securely authenticate your workloads to Google Cloud APIs by
configuring Kubernetes service accounts to act as IAM service
accounts. For instructions, refer to
Configure applications to use Workload Identity Federation for GKE .
Authorize actions at the project level
To authorize actions across clusters at the project level, use
IAM. You can grant or deny access to specific
GKE and Kubernetes API resources using IAM
roles and permissions. For instructions, refer to Create IAM policies .
Authorize actions at the cluster level
To authorize actions on Kubernetes API resources in specific clusters,
use the built-in Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism.
For instructions, refer to Authorize actions in clusters using RBAC .
Authorize actions at the organization level
You can use Google Cloud Organization Policy Service to enforce constraints
on specific operations on GKE resources across your Google Cloud
organization. For instructions, refer to Restrict actions on GKE resources using custom organization policies .
Harden clusters and workloads
If you have specialized isolation or hardening requirements beyond the
pre-configured Autopilot measures, consider the following resources:
Use case
Resources
Restrict public access to your cluster endpoint
Configure the network isolation of your Autopilot clusters and
disable the external endpoint of the cluster control plane. For instructions,
refer to Configure the control plane access .
Restrict cluster access to specific networks
Use control plane authorized networks
to specify IP address ranges that can access your cluster.
Store sensitive information outside your cluster
Storing sensitive data in an external, encrypted storage provider with
versioning enabled is a common compliance requirement and a best practice.
Use Secret Manager to store your data and access it from
your Autopilot clusters using Workload Identity Federation for GKE. For
instructions, refer to
Access secrets stored outside GKE clusters using Workload Identity Federation for GKE .
Verify container images before deployment to your cluster
Use Binary Authorization to check the integrity of the container images
referenced in your Pod manifests at deploy time. For instructions, refer to
Verify container images at deploy time using Binary Authorization .
Monitor your security posture
After setting up your clusters and deploying your workloads, you should set up
and configure monitoring and logging so that you have observability over your
cluster security posture. We recommend that you do all of the following:
Enroll your clusters in the
GKE security posture dashboard
to audit workloads for concerns such as problematic security configurations
or vulnerabilities in your container operating system packages and get
actionable mitigation information.
Get notified about new security bulletins and upgrade events using
cluster notifications .
Observe your clusters using the
GKE dashboard
in Cloud Monitoring or the
Observability tab in GKE.
Learn how to view and
manage your
GKE audit logs in Cloud Logging.
