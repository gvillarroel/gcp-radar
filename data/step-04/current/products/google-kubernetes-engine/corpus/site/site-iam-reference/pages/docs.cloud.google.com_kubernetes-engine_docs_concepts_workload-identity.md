Standard
This document describes Workload Identity Federation for GKE, including how it
works, how enabling it affects your GKE clusters, and how to
grant roles to Kubernetes entities in Identity and Access Management policies. In most cases,
Workload Identity Federation for GKE is the recommended way to help secure and manage how your
workloads that run on GKE access Google Cloud services.
This document is for Security specialists and Operators who manage
workloads on GKE that require access to other Google Cloud
services. To learn more about common roles and example tasks that we reference
in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Terminology
This page distinguishes between
Kubernetes service accounts
and Identity and Access Management (IAM) service accounts .
Kubernetes service accounts
Kubernetes resources that provide an identity for processes
running in your GKE pods.
IAM service accounts
Google Cloud resources that allow applications to make authorized calls to
Google Cloud APIs.
What is Workload Identity Federation for GKE?
Applications running on GKE might need access to
Google Cloud APIs such as Compute Engine API, BigQuery Storage API, or
Machine Learning APIs.
Workload Identity Federation for GKE lets you use IAM policies to grant
Kubernetes workloads in your GKE cluster access to specific
Google Cloud APIs without needing manual configuration or less secure
methods like service account key files. Using
Workload Identity Federation for GKE lets you assign distinct, fine-grained identities and
authorization for each application in your cluster.
Workload Identity Federation for GKE replaces the need to use
Metadata concealment .
The sensitive metadata protected by metadata concealment is also protected by
Workload Identity Federation for GKE.
Workload Identity Federation for GKE is available through IAM
Workload Identity Federation, which provides identities for workloads that run
in environments inside and outside Google Cloud. You can use
IAM Workload Identity Federation to securely authenticate to
supported Google Cloud APIs
from workloads running on, for example, AWS, Azure, and self-managed Kubernetes.
In GKE,
Google Cloud manages the workload identity pool and provider for you and
doesn't require an external identity provider.
How Workload Identity Federation for GKE works
When you enable Workload Identity Federation for GKE on a cluster, GKE does the
following:
Creates a fixed workload identity pool for the cluster's Google Cloud
project with the following format:
PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog
The workload identity pool provides a naming format that allows
IAM to understand and trust Kubernetes credentials.
GKE doesn't delete this workload identity pool even if you
delete all of the clusters in your project.
Registers the GKE cluster as an identity provider in the
workload identity pool.
Deploys the GKE metadata server , which
intercepts credential requests from workloads, on every node.
Note: Enabling Workload Identity Federation for GKE on the cluster doesn't grant your workloads
any additional IAM permissions.
Create IAM allow policies on Google Cloud resources
To provide access with Workload Identity Federation for GKE, you create an IAM
allow policy that grants access on a specific Google Cloud resource
to a principal that corresponds to your application's identity. For example,
you could give read permissions on a Cloud Storage bucket to all Pods that
use the database-reader Kubernetes ServiceAccount.
For a list of resources that support allow policies, see
Resource types that accept allow policies .
Use conditions in IAM policies
You can also limit the scope of the access by setting conditions in your
allow policies. Conditions are an extensible method of specifying when an allow
policy should apply. For example, you could use conditions to grant temporary
access to a workload on a specific Google Cloud resource, eliminating the
need to manage that access manually.
Conditions might also be useful if you set your allow policies at the project,
folder, or organization level instead of on specific resources like
Secret Manager secrets or Cloud Storage buckets.
To add a condition to your allow policy, use the following resources:
Manage conditional role bindings :
Add, modify, or remove conditional role bindings.
Configure temporary access : Use
conditions to set expiring access to Google Cloud resources in allow
policies.
Tags and conditional access : Use conditions
to only apply allow policies when resources have specific tags.
The following example expressions are for common scenarios in which you might use
conditions. For a list of available attributes in expressions, see
Attribute reference for IAM Conditions .
Example condition expressions
Allow access before the specified time
request.time TIMESTAMP ')
Replace TIMESTAMP with a timestamp in UTC, like
2024-08-30T00:00:00.000Z .
Allow access if the resource in the request has the specified tag
resource.matchTag(' TAG_KEY ', ' TAG_VALUE ')
Replace the following:
TAG_KEY : the tag key to match, like env
TAG_VALUE : the value of the tag, like dev
Reference Kubernetes resources in IAM policies
In your IAM policy, you refer to a Kubernetes resource by using
an IAM principal identifier to select the resource. This
identifier has the following syntax:
PREFIX ://iam.googleapis.com/projects/1234567890/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/example-project.svc.id.goog/ SELECTOR
In this example, consider the following fields:
PREFIX : must be principal or principalSet depending
on the resource that you select. principal is for a specific resource, like
a single ServiceAccount. principalSet is for multiple resources that belong to
the specified resource, like all Pods in a specific cluster.
SELECTOR : a string that selects a principal type. For
example, kubernetes.serviceaccount.uid/ SERVICEACCOUNT_UID
selects a ServiceAccount by its UID.
The following table shows the supported principal types in GKE:
Principal identifier type
Syntax
All Pods that use a specific Kubernetes ServiceAccount
Select the ServiceAccount by name:
principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog/subject/ns/ NAMESPACE /sa/ SERVICEACCOUNT
Replace the following:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your numerical project
number. To get the project number, see
Identifying projects .
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
NAMESPACE : the Kubernetes namespace.
SERVICEACCOUNT : the Kubernetes ServiceAccount
name.
Select the ServiceAccount by UID:
principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog/kubernetes.serviceaccount.uid/ SERVICEACCOUNT_UID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your numerical project
number. To get the project number, see
Identifying projects .
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
SERVICEACCOUNT_UID : the UID of the
ServiceAccount object in the API server.

Identifying projects .
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
NAMESPACE : the Kubernetes namespace.
All Pods in a specific cluster
principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog/kubernetes.cluster/https://container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /clusters/ CLUSTER_NAME
Replace the following:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your numerical project
number. To get the project number, see
Identifying projects .
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID.
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of your
GKE cluster.
LOCATION : the location of your cluster.
Credential flow
When a workload sends a request to access a Google Cloud API, for example
when using a Google Cloud client library, the following authentication
steps occur:
Figure 1: How a workload gets a federated access token with Workload Identity Federation for GKE.
Application default credentials (ADC)
requests a Google Cloud access token from the Compute Engine
metadata server that runs on the VM.
The GKE metadata server intercepts the token request and asks
the Kubernetes API server for a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token that
identifies the requesting workload. This credential is a JSON web token
(JWT) that's signed by the API server.
The GKE metadata server uses
Security Token Service to exchange the JWT for a
short-lived
federated access token
that references the identity of the Kubernetes workload.
The federated access token that's returned by Security Token Service might have
limitations when trying to access some Google Cloud services, as described
in Supported products and limitations .
If your selected Google Cloud service has limitations, you can optionally
configure service account impersonation. This method results in an access token
for an IAM service account that your workload can use to access
the target service. For details, see
link Kubernetes ServiceAccounts to IAM .
The workload can then access any Google Cloud APIs that the
IAM principal identifier of the workload can access.
Note: Even with Workload Identity Federation for GKE configured on a cluster, GKE
still uses the configured IAM service account for the node pool
to pull container images from the image registry. If you encounter
ImagePullBackOff or ErrImagePull errors, see
Troubleshoot image pulls .
Quota for the Exchange Token API in Security Token Service
The Exchange Token API in Security Token Service has a quota limit
of 6,000 requests per minute. If you see QUOTA_EXCEEDED errors, you can
request an increase for the Token exchange requests per minute quota through
the Quotas & System Limits
page.
Note: The Exchange Token quota will be gradually updated to use a regional one
in versions after 1.33.0-gke.1552000. New quota requests should
use Token exchange requests (regional) per minute per region going forward.
Identity sameness
If the metadata in your principal identifier is the same for workloads in
multiple clusters that share a workload identity pool because they belong to the
same Google Cloud project, IAM identifies those workloads
as the same. For example, if you have the same namespace in two clusters and you
grant access to that namespace in IAM, the workloads in that
namespace in both clusters get that access. You can limit this access to
specific clusters by using conditional IAM policies.
For example, consider the following diagram. Clusters A and B belong to the
same workload identity pool. Google Cloud identifies applications that use
the back-ksa ServiceAccount in the backend namespace of both Cluster A and
Cluster B as the same identity. IAM doesn't distinguish between
the clusters making the calls.
Figure 2: Identity sameness accessing Google Cloud APIs with Workload Identity Federation for GKE.
This identity sameness also means that you must be able to trust every cluster
in a specific workload identity pool. For example, if a new cluster, Cluster C
in the previous example was owned by an untrusted team, they could create a
backend namespace and access Google Cloud APIs using the back-ksa
ServiceAccount, just like Cluster A and Cluster B.
To avoid untrusted access, place your clusters in separate projects to ensure
that they get different workload identity pools, or ensure that the namespace
names are distinct from each other to avoid a common principal identifier.
GKE metadata server
When you enable Workload Identity Federation for GKE for a cluster, every node in the cluster
stores metadata on the GKE metadata server . The
GKE metadata server is a subset of the
Compute Engine metadata server endpoints
required for Kubernetes workloads.
The GKE metadata server runs as a DaemonSet, with one Pod on
every Linux node or a native Windows service on every Windows node in the
cluster. The metadata server intercepts HTTP requests to http://metadata.google.internal
( 169.254.169.254:80 ). For example, the GET
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token request retrieves a
token for the IAM service account that the Pod is configured to impersonate.
Traffic to the GKE metadata server never leaves the VM instance
that hosts the Pod.
Token lifetime
By default, the access token returned has a lifetime of 1 hour (3,600 seconds).
To reduce client latency, the GKE metadata server caches the
access tokens. In some situations, the cached token that the metadata server
returns might be close to its expiry time.
Cloud Client Libraries have built-in
logic that, by default, checks whether the access token expires in the next 3
minutes and 45 seconds. If the token is within the expiry period,
GKE refreshes the token. Consecutive API calls can use the
refreshed token.
If you use your own code to directly access Google Cloud APIs, implement
similar logic to handle token expiry. Your code should do the following:
Check whether the access token expires after a period of 3 minutes and 45
seconds. The exp parameter in the token payload indicates the token
expiration timestamp.
If the token is set to expire in the next 3 minutes and 45 seconds, make a
token request.
Note: If you have a strict cluster network policy
in place, you must allow egress to the following IP addresses and port numbers
so your Pod can communicate with the GKE metadata server. Allow
egress to 169.254.169.252/32 on port 988 . For clusters running
GKE Dataplane V2, ensure that you allowed egress to 169.254.169.254/32 on port
80 .
The following tables describe the subset of Compute Engine metadata server
endpoints available with the GKE metadata server. For a full list
of endpoints available in the Compute Engine metadata server, see
Default VM metadata values .

Entry
Description
hostname
The hostname of your node.
id
The unique ID of your node.
service-accounts/
A directory of service accounts associated with the node. For each
service account, the following information is available:
aliases
email : the service account email address.
identity : a JSON Web Token (JWT) unique to the node.
You must include the audience parameter in your request.
For example, ?audience=http://www.example.com .

Restrictions of Workload Identity Federation for GKE
You can't change the name of the workload identity pool that
GKE creates for your Google Cloud project.
If you
link Kubernetes ServiceAccounts to IAM service accounts
to configure Workload Identity Federation for GKE, the GKE metadata server
returns a value of
SERVICEACCOUNT_NAME .svc.id.goog
as the service account identifier. This identifier doesn't use the standard
IAM principal identifier syntax, which might cause errors in
some programmatic operations. To get the service account identifier as an
IAM principal identifier, add the
iam.gke.io/return-principal-id-as-email: "true" annotation to your Kubernetes
ServiceAccount.
When GKE enables the GKE metadata server
on a node pool, Pods can no longer access the Compute Engine metadata server .
Instead, the GKE metadata server intercepts requests made from
these pods to metadata endpoints, with the exception of Pods running on the
host network.
Caution: Pods running on the
host network
( hostNetwork: true ) don't use Workload Identity Federation for GKE. GKE
automatically routes requests from these Pods to the Compute Engine metadata
server.
When using Cloud Storage FUSE CSI driver with Standard GKE clusters with version 1.33.3-gke.1226000 or later, the Pods running on the host network ( hostNetwork: true ) can authenticate using their own Kubernetes Service Account. For more information, see Configure access for Pods with host network .
The GKE metadata server takes a few seconds to start accepting
requests on a newly created Pod. Therefore, attempts to
authenticate using Workload Identity Federation for GKE within the first few seconds of a Pod's life might
fail. Retrying the call will resolve the problem. See Troubleshooting
for more details.
GKE built-in logging and monitoring agents continue to use the
node's service account .
Workload Identity Federation for GKE requires manual setup for Knative serving to
continue releasing request metrics .
Workload Identity Federation for GKE sets a limit of 500 concurrent connections to the GKE
metadata server for each node. Additional concurrent calls that exceed this
limit are placed in a wait queue for later processing. This queuing mechanism
might lead to HTTP/499 errors if the client timeout is reached before the
GKE metadata server can process the request.
The GKE metadata server uses memory resources proportional to
the total number of Kubernetes service accounts in your cluster. If your
cluster has more than 3000 Kubernetes service accounts, the kubelet might
terminate the metadata server Pods. For mitigations, refer to
Troubleshooting .
Workload Identity Federation for GKE operates within a VPC Service Controls perimeter, allowing access to
resources within it. However, VPC Service Controls
does not enforce access control for cross-perimeter requests based on these
federated identities. You can use service account impersonation to access
resources in a different perimeter.
Alternatives to Workload Identity Federation for GKE
You can use one of the following alternatives to Workload Identity Federation for GKE to access
Google Cloud APIs from GKE. We recommend that you use
Workload Identity Federation for GKE because these alternatives require you to make certain
security compromises.
Use the Compute Engine default service account
of your nodes. You can run node pools as any IAM service account
in your project. If you don't specify a service account during node pool
creation, GKE uses the Compute Engine default service account
for the project. The Compute Engine service account is shared by all workloads
deployed on that node. This can result in over-provisioning of permissions, which
violates the principle of least privilege and is inappropriate for multi-tenant
clusters.
Export service account keys and store
them as
Kubernetes Secrets
that you mount to your Pods as volumes.
Caution:
Service account keys are a security risk if not managed correctly. You should
choose a more secure alternative to service account keys
whenever possible. If you must authenticate with a service account key, you are responsible for the
security of the private key and for other operations described by
Best practices for managing service account keys .
If you are prevented from creating a service account key, service account key creation might
be disabled for your organization. For more information, see
Managing secure-by-default organization resources .
If you acquired the service account key from an external source, you must validate it before use.
For more information, see
Security requirements for externally sourced credentials .
