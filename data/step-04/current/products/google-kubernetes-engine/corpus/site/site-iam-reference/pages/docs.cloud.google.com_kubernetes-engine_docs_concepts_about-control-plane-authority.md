Note: This document uses a
general availability feature named
GKE control plane authority that's only available for eligible Google Cloud
customers. To request access to this feature, contact your Google Cloud account team.
This page describes the options that Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) offers to
improve your visibility and control over the security of the managed control
plane. These options are collectively referred to as
GKE control plane authority . This page is intended for information
security leaders, compliance administrators, and analysts who want to meet
strict privacy and security needs for handling sensitive data.
About GKE control plane authority features
In GKE, Google Cloud fully manages the security configuration of
the control plane, including encryption of storage at rest , and
configuring the keys and certificate authorities (CAs) that sign and verify credentials in your clusters. The control plane nodes for
GKE clusters exist in projects that Google Cloud manages.
For details about what Google Cloud does, see
GKE shared responsibility .
GKE control plane authority is an optional set of visibility and
control capabilities that let you verify and manage specific aspects of these
fully-managed control plane nodes. These capabilities are ideal if you have
requirements like the following:
You operate in a highly regulated industry like finance, healthcare, or
government with specific compliance requirements
You handle sensitive data that has strict security and encryption
requirements
You want enhanced visibility over GKE to improve your
confidence when running critical workloads
You have to meet specific compliance or auditing requirements related to
data encryption, software integrity, or logging
You have highly-sensitive workloads that process critical data, and you want
visibility into the encryption of and access to that data
You want to enforce custom security policies that meet specific
organizational or regulatory requirements
You want an enhanced level of transparency and visibility into your
GKE environments, especially related to actions that
Google Cloud takes in the control plane
Benefits of GKE control plane authority
GKE control plane authority capabilities are ideal in highly regulated
environments that have strict security policies or strict audit requirements.
Using these capabilities grants benefits like the following:
Enhanced visibility and control : use additional visibility, control, and
encryption capabilities for your GKE control plane.
Streamlined compliance : meet regulatory and industry
requirements with granular audit logs and customizable security policies.
Increased trust and transparency : gain insights into the actions that
Google Cloud takes in the control plane when resolving customer
support cases.
Risk mitigation : proactively detect and respond to potential threats to
the managed control plane with comprehensive logs.
Standardized CA and key management : manage your
GKE cluster CAs using Certificate Authority Service, letting you
delegate certificate management to specific teams and letting you
comprehensively enforce CA policies. Additionally, manage your control plane
disk encryption keys using Cloud KMS for similar management
delegation.
Availability of GKE control plane authority
GKE control plane authority is available in any Google Cloud
region. However, to encrypt your control plane boot disks and etcd disks with
your own keys, you must create the cluster in one of the following regions:
asia-east1
asia-northeast1
asia-southeast1
europe-west1
europe-west4
us-central1
us-central2
us-east1
us-east4
us-east5
us-south1
us-west1
us-west3
us-west4
Note: Separately from GKE control plane authority, you can use
Confidential mode for Hyperdisk Balanced for your node disks .
If you plan to use Confidential mode for Hyperdisk Balanced for your nodes in addition to encrypting your
control plane disks with your own keys, you must create the cluster in a
region that supports Confidential mode for Hyperdisk Balanced .
If you create the cluster in a different region, you won't be able to use
Confidential mode for Hyperdisk Balanced for your nodes.
How GKE control plane authority works
The capabilities that you can use with the control plane are categorized based
on the type of control that you want, as follows. You can use one or more of
these capabilities based on your specific requirements.
Key and credential management : control the keys that GKE
uses to encrypt data at rest in the control plane and to issue and verify
identities in the cluster.
Access logs and identity issuance logs : use logs from the network, VM,
and Access Transparency to verify GKE control plane
access using multiple sources. Use identity issuance logs in
Cloud KMS and CA Service to see when identities are
created using keys and CAs that you manage. Use detailed Kubernetes API
usage logs to track what those identities do in the cluster.
Key and credential management
By default, Google Cloud manages the keys and CAs in your
GKE clusters for you. You can optionally use
Cloud KMS and
CA Service
to set up your own keys and CAs, which you then use when creating a new cluster.
GKE uses these keys and CAs instead of the Google Cloud
defaults to issue and verify identities in your cluster and to encrypt data in
your control plane VMs. Maintaining control over your identity issuance and data
encryption keys can help you to do the following:
Comply with data sovereignty and privacy regulations that mandate exclusive
control over keys
Control the encryption of critical sensitive data in Kubernetes by
managing your own encryption keys
Customize your data encryption strategy based on your organization's
policies and requirements, like requirements to use hardware-backed keys.
Self-managed CAs and service account keys
You can configure the GKE control plane to use
Cloud KMS keys and CA Service CAs that you manage.
GKE uses these resources to issue and verify identities in your
cluster. For example, GKE uses CAs and keys to issue
Kubernetes client certificates
and
Kubernetes service account bearer tokens .
You create the following resources for GKE to use when issuing
identities:
Service Account signing keys : sign the Kubernetes ServiceAccount bearer
tokens for service accounts in the cluster. These bearer tokens are JSON Web
Tokens (JWTs) that facilitate Pod communication with the Kubernetes API
server.
Service Account verification keys : verify the Kubernetes Service Account
JWTs. This key is normally the same as the signing key, but is
configured separately so that you can rotate your keys more safely.
Cluster CA : issue signed certificates for
purposes like certificate signing requests (CSRs) and kubelet communication.
etcd peer CA : issue signed certificates for communication between
etcd instances in the cluster.
etcd API CA : issue signed certificates for communication with the
etcd API server.
Aggregation CA : issue signed certificates for enabling
communication between the Kubernetes API server and extension servers.
When GKE issues identities in the cluster, you see the
corresponding audit logs in Cloud Logging, which you can use to track issued
identities over their lifetime.
To learn more, see
Run your own certificate authorities and signing keys in GKE .
Control plane boot disk and etcd encryption
By default, GKE encrypts the boot disk of a control plane VM.
If the control plane runs etcd database instances, GKE also
encrypts the following:
The disk that stores etcd data.
The Google Cloud internal operational backup of etcd.
This default encryption uses encryption keys that Google Cloud manages.
For details about this default encryption, see
Default encryption at rest .
You can optionally use your own encryption keys that you manage using
Cloud KMS to encrypt the following resources:
Control plane boot disk : the Compute Engine disk that each
control plane VM uses to boot.
etcd disk : the Compute Engine disk that's
attached to each control plane VM and stores data for etcd instances in
the cluster.
etcd internal operational backup : the internal Google Cloud backup
of etcd that's used for operational purposes like disaster recovery.
This backup is an emergency measure internal to Google Cloud. If you
want to back up and restore your clusters, use
backup for GKE
instead.
For instructions, see
Encrypt etcd and control plane boot disks .
This additional optional encryption is ideal if you have to meet specific
regulatory or compliance requirements related to controlling the means of
encryption in your cluster control plane. You can separately use your own keys
to encrypt the boot disks and storage disks of worker nodes in your cluster.
For details, see
Use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) .
When you use GKE control plane authority to encrypt your control plane
boot disks, GKE control plane VMs automatically use
Confidential mode for Hyperdisk Balanced in the boot disks. This configuration doesn't change the default boot
disks of your worker nodes.
Rotation of customer-managed credentials
Preview
— customer-managed credential rotation
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
With GKE control plane authority, you can configure clusters to use
customer-managed CAs and keys instead of the Google-managed resources that
GKE uses by default. A credential rotation is an operation that
you perform to refresh one or more of these resources in a cluster. You might
perform a credential rotation for reasons like avoiding CA expiry or complying
with your organization's credential management requirements.
To perform a credential rotation for a cluster that uses
GKE control plane authority, you create new CAs, signing keys, and
encryption keys. You then update your cluster to use those new resources.
For more information, see the following pages:
Rotate customer-managed control plane CAs and keys .
Rotate etcd and control plane boot disk encryption keys .
Access logs and identity issuance logs
You can view logs in Logging for all events related to access and
identity in the control plane, including the following events:
Direct access : logs related to direct access attempts (like SSH) to
GKE control plane nodes let you verify that the VM SSH
logs and VM network connections match the SSH records in Access Transparency
logs.
Identity issuance and verification : logs related to identities that were
issued using CAs and keys that you manage in CA Service and
Cloud KMS.
Identity usage in Kubernetes : logs related to the actions that specific
identities take against the Kubernetes API server.
Access Transparency : logs related to connections made to the control plane and
actions taken on the control plane by Google Cloud personnel.
These logs can help you to do the following:
Maintain comprehensive audit trails of all control plane access and identity
events for compliance and security.
In addition to the built-in Google protections, you can build your own
monitoring to identify and investigate any suspicious activity within the
control plane.
Verify that only authorized entities access and interact with your
GKE cluster, which improves your security posture.
See when identities are created using keys and CAs that you manage by using
identity issuance logs in Cloud KMS and CA Service.
Use detailed Kubernetes API usage logs to track what those identities do in
the cluster.
The following documents show you how to view and process the various types of
control plane logs:
Verify credential issuance and verification operations in GKE clusters
Verify connections by Google personnel in the cluster control plane
Additional resources about control plane security
This section describes other methods that you can use to improve your confidence
in your control plane security. You don't need to use
GKE control plane authority to use the following resources:
Control plane VM image integrity : GKE adds detailed logs
for node VM creation and boot events to Cloud Logging. Additionally, we
publish SLSA VSAs on GitHub
that correspond to control plane and worker node machine images. You can
verify that your VMs use OS images that have corresponding VSAs and verify the
boot integrity of each control plane VM.
To perform VM integrity verification, see
Verify GKE control plane VM integrity .
Built-in control plane security measures : GKE performs
various hardening measures on the managed control plane. To learn more, see
Control plane security .
