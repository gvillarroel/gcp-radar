Encrypt your data in-transit in GKE with user-managed encryption keys
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Standard
This page shows you how to encrypt in-transit data for Pod
communications across Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
nodes by using user-managed encryption keys. This level of control over your
encryption keys is useful if you're in a regulated industry and have a business
need for compliance and security audits. On this page, you learn about configuring
for single and multi-cluster environments, including best practices and limitations.
This page is for Security specialists who require fine-grained control
over encryption keys to meet compliance and security requirements. To learn more about
common roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
Before reading this page, ensure that you're familiar with the following concepts:
In-transit data .
WireGuard, which GKE uses to perform encryption in GKE Dataplane V2 , in
addition to the default encryption provided by VM NICs.
By default, Google encrypts all data in-transit between
VMs at the network interface controller (NIC)
level to ensure the confidentiality of the data in-transit, regardless of what
service or application is running on the VM (including GKE). This
layer of encryption is applicable to all GKE nodes and Pod
traffic. The encryption keys are provided and managed by Google.
You can enable inter-node transparent encryption in single and multi-cluster
environments. For more information about how this feature works, see How
inter-node transparent encryption works with GKE .
Limitations
This feature on its own doesn't guarantee that Google can't access the
encryption keys stored in the GKE node memory. In some
regulated environments or jurisdictions, or to meet specific compliance
requirements, you might want to further encrypt these keys and control
access. To do this, we recommend that you use inter-node transparent
encryption with
Confidential GKE Nodes .
Inter-node transparent encryption for GKE is only supported
on GKE Dataplane V2 clusters.
GKE Autopilot is not supported.
Inter-node transparent encryption for GKE uses WireGuard.
WireGuard is not
FIPS
compliant.
Encryption keys are not dynamically rotated. Key rotation needs to be
handled manually by restarting the nodes.
Inter-node transparent encryption along with Confidential GKE Nodes
works only on Container-Optimized OS (COS) and Ubuntu, and not on
Windows.
Inter-node transparent encryption does not encrypt network traffic initiated
by the GKE node or a Pod using the hostNetwork .
Inter-node transparent encryption does not encrypt network traffic sent to a
Pod exposed on a node port. Even when ExternalTrafficPolicy: Cluster is
configured on the Service, the traffic forwarded from the first node
receiving traffic from the client to the backend Pod is not encrypted.
The maximum number of nodes supported with inter-node transparent encryption
enabled for single cluster or multi-cluster configurations is 500.
Inter-node transparent encryption might result in the nodes being
oversubscribed. You might expect 15% CPU increase on average on
n2-standard-8 nodes with the Ubuntu OS with 2 Gbps throughput.
The increase in CPU utilization is not attributed to any Pod because it is
not aware by the kube-scheduler. The Pod with increased traffic might use
all CPU resources on the node. This can prevent other Pods from getting the
CPU resources they need, even if they are properly configured. This can
cause problems for Pods that are trying to run sensitive workloads or that
need to be able to respond quickly to requests. As a workaround, you can
keep a significant amount of CPU unscheduled on nodes that have inter-node
transparent encryption enabled. Alternatively, you can schedule a Pod with a
low PriorityClass
that has a large CPU request but never uses this CPU.
Inter-node transparent encryption incurs 150 microseconds of latency on two
nodes in the same zone that don't use Confidential GKE Nodes.
When you enable inter-node transparent encryption, traffic observability
features used for tracking traffic on the Pods might not work as expected
because the data in-transit is encrypted with keys that are not accessible
to the underlying Google infrastructure.
When you enable inter-node transparent encryption, Pod IP addresses are not
visible on the VPC. Features that depend on packet inspection
such as Packet Mirroring and Pod CIDR based VPC
firewall rules are not compatible with inter-node transparent encryption.
When you enable inter-node transparent encryption across clusters attached
to different VPC subnets, you need to manually create
firewall rules to allow communications between the cluster nodes.
Inter-node transparent encryption turns off the some Layer 7 capabilities of
GKE Dataplane V2. As a result, you can't enable FQDN network policy
and inter-node transparent encryption at the same time.
You cannot enable this feature at the same time as intranode visibility .
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure that you have performed the following tasks:
Enable
the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
Enable Google Kubernetes Engine API
If you want to use the Google Cloud CLI for this task,
install and then
initialize the
gcloud CLI. If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest
version by running the gcloud components update command. Earlier gcloud CLI versions might not support running the commands in this document.
Note: For existing gcloud CLI
installations, make sure to set the compute/region property . If you use primarily zonal clusters, set the compute/zone instead. By setting a default location,
you can avoid errors in the gcloud CLI like the following:
One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location . You might need to specify the location in certain commands if the location of your cluster differs from the default that you set.
GKE inter-node transparent encryption is only supported on
Google Cloud CLI version 458.0.0 and later and the following
GKE versions:
1.26.10-gke.1024000 or later
1.27.7-gke.1506000 or later
1.28.2-gke.1098000 or later
Enable inter-node transparent encryption with GKE
You can enable inter-node transparent encryption with GKE on a
single cluster or in a multi-cluster environment.
Enable on a new cluster
To enable inter-node transparent encryption on a new cluster:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--enable-datapane-v2 \
--in-transit-encryption inter-node-transparent
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster.
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION : the Compute Engine
location of the control plane of your
cluster. Provide a region for regional clusters, or a zone for zonal clusters.
Note: We recommend that you create new clusters with inter-node encryption
enabled, rather than creating them with inter-node encryption disabled and
subsequently enabling it. Enabling inter-node encryption at a later time may
result in node pool restarts.
To verify your configuration, use the following command to check the
encryption status:
kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti anetd-XXXX -- cilium status | grep Encryption
The output is similar to the following:
Encryption: Wireguard [cilium_wg0 (Pubkey: <key>, Port: 51871, Peers: 2)]
Note: Verify that the number of peers is one less than the number of nodes
in your cluster. For example, in a cluster with 24 nodes, the number of
peers should be 23. If the number of peers isn't one less than the number of
nodes in the cluster, restart the anetd agent on your nodes again.
Enable on an existing cluster
To enable inter-node transparent encryption on an existing cluster:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--in-transit-encryption inter-node-transparent \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster.
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION : the Compute Engine
location of the control plane of your
cluster. Provide a region for regional clusters, or a zone for zonal clusters.
Note: We recommend that you perform this operation during a maintenance
window as this operation might disrupt the traffic to your Pod. The
cluster update and installation of the inter-node encryption network may
require several hours to finish.
To check that the Google Cloud CLI command completed successfully :
gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--format json | jq .status
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster.
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION : the Compute Engine
location of the control plane of your
cluster. Provide a region for regional clusters, or a zone for zonal clusters.
Wait until the status displays "RUNNING". Enabling inter-node encryption in
GKE will automatically restart the nodes. It might take
several hours for the node restart to occur and for the new nodes to
enforce policies.
To confirm that nodes have restarted:
kubectl get nodes
Check the AGE field of each node and proceed if the AGE field reflects
new nodes.
To verify your configuration, you can use the following command to check the
encryption status:
kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti anetd-XXXX -- cilium status | grep Encryption
The output is similar to the following:
Encryption: Wireguard [cilium_wg0 (Pubkey: <key>, Port: 51871, Peers: 2)]
Verify that the number of peers is one less than the number of nodes in your
cluster. For example, in a cluster with 24 nodes, the number of peers should
be 23. If the number of peers isn't one less than the number of nodes in the
cluster, restart the anetd agent on your nodes again.
Enable across multiple clusters
Inter-node transparent encryption is not supported on Autopilot
clusters. If your fleet includes Autopilot clusters, they won't be able to
communicate with Standard clusters that have encryption enabled.
To enable inter-node transparent encryption in a multi-cluster environment:
Enable inter-node transparent encryption on a new cluster
or in an existing cluster .
Register your cluster
to a fleet.
Enable inter-node transparent encryption for the fleet:
gcloud container fleet dataplane-v2-encryption enable --project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Verify status on all nodes:
kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l k8s-app = cilium -o name | xargs -I {} kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti {} -- cilium status
The output is similar to the following:
...
Encryption: Wireguard [cilium_wg0 (Pubkey: <key>, Port: 51871, Peers: 5)]
...
Note: Verify that the number of peers is one less than the number of nodes
all registered clusters. For example, in a cluster with 24 nodes, the number
of peers should be 23. If the number of peers isn't one less than the number
of nodes in the cluster, restart the anetd agent on your nodes again.
Disable inter-node transparent encryption
In some cases, you might want to disable inter-node transparent encryption in
your GKE cluster for performance improvements, or to troubleshoot
connectivity for your application. Before proceeding with this operation,
consider the following:
Inter-node transparent encryption is enabled for the entire cluster and you
can't partially disable it in individual Kubernetes resources such as
namespaces or Pods.
Perform this operation during a maintenance window as this operation will
disrupt the traffic of your Pod.
Disable on a single cluster
To disable inter-node transparent encryption on a single cluster:
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--location = CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION \
--in-transit-encryption none
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : with your name of your cluster.
CONTROL_PLANE_LOCATION : the Compute Engine
location of the control plane of your
cluster. Provide a region for regional clusters, or a zone for zonal clusters.
Note: We recommend that you perform this operation during a maintenance window as this
operation might disrupt the traffic to your Pod. The cluster update and disabling
of the inter-node encryption network may require several hours to finish, as it
recreates the node pool.
Disable in a cluster that's part of a fleet
You can turn off encryption for a cluster in a fleet by using either of the
following two options:
To completely remove the cluster from the fleet, unregister your
cluster .
Alternatively, keep the cluster in the fleet but disable encryption:
gcloud container fleet dataplane-v2-encryption disable --project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Disabling encryption with this command initiates the removal of remote nodes
from the Wireguard peers list on each cluster. This process can take up to
several minutes to complete, depending on the number of clusters and nodes
involved. To see the updated peer count, you'll need to manually refresh
the WireGuard peers list on each cluster. You can use your cluster management
tool or the following command:
kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti anetd-XXXX -- cilium status | grep Encryption
Disable for an entire fleet of clusters
To disable inter-node transparent encryption in a fleet:
gcloud container fleet dataplane-v2-encryption disable --project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
To disable inter-node transparent encryption and remove the now unused API,
disable the GKE Dataplane V2 API at the fleet level. This will turn off the
GKE Dataplane V2 controller running in your fleet.
gcloud services disable gkedataplanev2.googleapis.com \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Note: This API is responsible for the inter-node transparent encryption
feature for your fleet. Make sure that you verify that this API is not used
by anything else in your fleet before you disable it to avoid unexpected
behavior.
To efficiently manage clusters with the same name and ensure multi-cluster
encryption activation, follow these steps:
Unregister the old cluster
from the fleet before creating a new one with the same name.
Re-register the new
cluster upon recreation.
If you forget to unregister
a cluster, delete the old membership, and recreate the new cluster with a
new membership.
Failure to follow these steps may result in multi-cluster encryption not
activating on the new cluster until the fleet membership is recreated.
How inter-node transparent encryption works with GKE
The following sections describe how inter-node transparent encryption works when
you enable it in your cluster:
Encryption of network traffic between two Pods on different nodes
With inter-node transparent encryption enabled, GKE Dataplane V2 encrypts
Pod-to-Pod traffic if Pods are on different nodes, regardless of the cluster to
which those nodes belong. When the clusters are part of the same
fleet , they belong to the same
encryption domain.
Note: Inter-node transparent encryption encrypts packets when they leave the
originating node. Inter-node transparent encryption doesn't encrypt packets
between Pods on the same node.
Clusters with different inter-node transparent encryption configurations can
co-exist in the same fleet. If you have a multi-cluster environment in which
only some clusters use inter-node transparent encryption, the following
considerations apply:
Pod-to-Pod communication between nodes in the same cluster is encrypted
using the public/private key pair.
Pod-to-Pod communication between a node in a cluster that has inter-node
transparent encryption enabled and a node in a cluster that doesn't have
inter-node transparent encryption enabled fails.
Encryption key generation and usage
When the feature is enabled, every GKE node in the cluster
automatically generates a public/private key pair known as the encryption
keys .
The private key is stored in memory (not on disk) and never leaves the
node. Using GKE Confidential
Nodes further
decreases the risk of keys being compromised because the node memory is also
encrypted (with different keys).
The public key is shared with other nodes using the GKE Dataplane V2 control
plane and is accessible to all nodes in the same encryption domain.
After the keys are exchanged, each node can establish a WireGuard tunnel with
other nodes in the same encryption domain. Each tunnel is unique for a given
pair of nodes.
Note: WireGuard is not
FIPS
compliant.
Consider the following when dealing with the private or public key pairs and
session key:
Private/public key pair:
The public key is distributed in the cluster and all nodes in the
cluster can access the public key.
The key pair is rotated when the node restarts. GKE
doesn't rotate keys at regular intervals. To manually trigger a key
rotation, drain and restart the node. This invalidates the original key
pair and generates a new key pair.
Session key:
This key is not configurable.
This key gets periodically rotated every two minutes.
The session key is exclusive to the nodes involved in the tunnel.
