Standard
Note: This document uses a
general availability feature named
GKE control plane authority that's only available for eligible Google Cloud
customers. To request access to this feature, contact your Google Cloud account team.
This page shows you how to configure your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster
control plane with certificate authorities (CAs) and keys that you manage. This
guidance is intended for security administrators who have specific
organizational compliance or policy requirements for control over credential
issuance and signing.
This page describes one part of a set of optional control plane features in
GKE that lets you perform tasks like verifying your control plane security posture
or configuring encryption and credential signing in the control plane using keys that you manage.
For details, see
About GKE control plane authority .
By default, Google Cloud applies various security measures to the managed control plane.
This page describes optional capabilities that give you more visibility or control over
the GKE control plane.
You should already be familiar with the following concepts:
Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)
Certificate authorities (CAs)
etcd
GKE cluster architecture
Control plane credential components
GKE clusters use specific CAs and keys to issue credentials in
the cluster, like X.509 certificates or ServiceAccount tokens. You can create
keys in Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS)
and CAs in
Certificate Authority Service
(CA Service) and configure your clusters to use these resources
instead of Google Cloud-managed CAs and keys.
To learn more about the specific components that you create, see
Self-managed CAs and keys .
Usage with other GKE control plane authority features
GKE control plane authority provides the following features related to
self-managed keys:
Run your own certificate authorities (CAs) and keys (this page)
Encrypt control plane components
Note: You can only enable these features when you create a new GKE
cluster. You can't update existing clusters to use these features. To use both
of these features in the same cluster, perform all of the key and CA
configuration procedures in both guides , and then run the cluster creation
command that enables both sets of features as described in the
Create a cluster section.
Objectives
Create keys in Cloud KMS
Create CAs in CA Service
Grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to the GKE service agent

features, contact your Google Cloud sales team.
To reliably track credential issuance and usage, ensure that the following
Data Access audit logs are enabled:
Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API: DATA_READ
Certificate Authority Service: ADMIN_READ
To enable these log types, see
Enable Data Access audit logs .
Required roles and permissions
To get the permissions that
you need to run your own CAs and keys,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
Create Cloud KMS keys:
Cloud KMS Admin ( roles/cloudkms.admin )
on your key project
Create CA pools and root CAs:
CA Service Admin ( roles/privateca.admin )
on your key project
Create GKE clusters:
Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin ( roles/container.clusterAdmin )
on your cluster project
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Requirements
You must meet the following requirements:
Your cluster must run GKE version 1.31.1-gke.1846000 or
later.
To set up control plane disk encryption with your own keys in addition to
configuring your own CAs, create your cluster in one of the following
regions:
asia-east1
asia-northeast1
asia-southeast1
europe-west1
europe-west4
us-central1
us-central2
us-east1
us-east4
us-east5
us-south1
us-west1
us-west3
us-west4
Note: Separately from GKE control plane authority, you can use
Confidential mode for Hyperdisk Balanced for your node disks .
If you plan to use Confidential mode for Hyperdisk Balanced for your nodes in addition to encrypting your
control plane disks with your own keys, you must create the cluster in a
region that supports Confidential mode for Hyperdisk Balanced .
If you create the cluster in a different region, you won't be able to use
Confidential mode for Hyperdisk Balanced for your nodes.
Limitations
The following limitations apply:
You can only use keys from Cloud KMS. You can't use another KMS
provider or another encryption provider.
Cloud External Key Manager (Cloud EKM) keys aren't supported.
You can only use CAs from CA Service.
Prepare the environment
In this section, you identify Google Cloud projects that you'll use in
this tutorial, and you create a key ring in Cloud KMS to hold your
keys.
Identify projects
We recommend that you use separate Google Cloud projects as follows:
Key project : contains all keys and CAs.
Cluster project : contains your GKE clusters.
You can optionally use the same project for your keys, CAs, and
GKE clusters, but we recommend that you use separate projects so
that the teams that manage cryptographic operations in your organization are
separated from the teams that manage cluster operations.
Create a key ring
Create a key ring in the key project to hold all of the keys for a specific
cluster. You must create the key ring in the same location as your
GKE cluster.
Note: You can't delete a key ring after creation. Key rings don't incur
additional costs. However, having too many key rings in a project might make
managing your resources in Cloud KMS more tedious.
Run the following command:
gcloud kms keyrings create KEY_RING_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
KEY_RING_NAME : a name for your key ring.
KEY_PROJECT_ID : the project ID of your key project.
LOCATION : the Google Cloud region where you
want to create the key ring. This must be the same region where your
GKE cluster is located.
Create keys
For each of the credential authorities like service account keys and CAs, you
create a key using Cloud KMS. This section shows you how to create the
keys that GKE uses to sign and verify credentials in the cluster.
You can specify your own properties for these keys depending on your
organization's needs. For details, see the Create a key
page and the
projects.locations.keyRings.cryptoKeys
API reference.
Caution: Don't enable automatic key rotation with Cloud KMS. Rotating
your encryption keys requires additional steps to ensure that your control plane
resources are re-encrypted with new key versions before the original key
versions are destroyed.
Consider the following when you create these resources in Cloud KMS:
If you have a existing key ring in your key project, you can use that key ring
to store all of the keys that you create for use with your cluster.
Your key ring must be in the same Google Cloud location as your cluster
to minimize latency.
Keys must specify asymmetric-signing as the key purpose.
Use the following algorithms based on the type of key:
ServiceAccount signing keys: a strong RSA signing PKCS1 algorithm, like
rsa-sign-pkcs1-4096-sha256 or rsa-sign-pkcs1-3072-sha256 .
Certificate authority keys: a strong algorithm like ec-sign-p256-sha256 .
Cloud HSM hardware keys are supported, but the software
protection level is sufficient for most use cases. For details about hardware
keys, see Cloud HSM .
Don't modify the
default duration for key destruction .
GKE doesn't prevent you from deleting Cloud KMS keys,
including CA Service keys, that are in use by the cluster.
Before you delete keys or CAs, ensure that the resources are unused.
To create your keys, run the following commands:
Create the Kubernetes ServiceAccount signing key, which you also specify as
the service account verification key during cluster creation:
gcloud kms keys create sa-signing-key \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--purpose = "asymmetric-signing" \
--protection-level = hsm \
--default-algorithm = rsa-sign-pkcs1-4096-sha256 \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Replace KEY_PROJECT_ID with the project ID for your
dedicated key project.
Create the cluster root CA key:
gcloud kms keys create cluster-ca-key \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--purpose = "asymmetric-signing" \
--protection-level = hsm \
--default-algorithm = ec-sign-p256-sha256 \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Create the etcd peer root CA key:
gcloud kms keys create etcd-peer-ca-key \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--purpose = "asymmetric-signing" \
--protection-level = hsm \
--default-algorithm = ec-sign-p256-sha256 \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Create the etcd API root CA key:
gcloud kms keys create etcd-api-ca-key \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--purpose = "asymmetric-signing" \
--protection-level = hsm \
--default-algorithm = ec-sign-p256-sha256 \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Create the aggregation root CA key:
gcloud kms keys create aggregation-ca-key \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--purpose = "asymmetric-signing" \
--protection-level = hsm \
--default-algorithm = ec-sign-p256-sha256 \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Create the CAs
After creating the keys for each of the control plane functions, use each key
to create the CA pools and corresponding root CAs using
CA Service:
Create the cluster CA pool:
gcloud privateca pools create cluster-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--tier = enterprise \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID \
--no-publish-crl --no-publish-ca-cert
The --no-publish-crl flag and the --no-publish-ca-cert flag are optional.
Omitting these flags publishes certificates to a Cloud Storage
bucket. For details, see
Enable CA certificate and CRL publication for CAs in a CA pool .
Create the cluster root CA:
gcloud privateca roots create cluster-root-ca \
--pool = cluster-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--kms-key-version = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/cluster-ca-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1 \
--subject = "CN=cluster-ca, O= ORGANIZATION " \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID \
--auto-enable
Replace ORGANIZATION with your organization name.
Create the etcd peer CA pool:
gcloud privateca pools create etcd-peer-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--tier = enterprise \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID \
--no-publish-crl --no-publish-ca-cert
Create the etcd peer root CA:
gcloud privateca roots create etcd-peer-root-ca \
--pool = etcd-peer-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--kms-key-version = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/etcd-peer-ca-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1 \
--subject = "CN=etcd-peer-ca, O= ORGANIZATION " \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID \
--auto-enable
Create the etcd API CA pool:
gcloud privateca pools create etcd-api-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--tier = enterprise \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID \
--no-publish-crl --no-publish-ca-cert
Create the etcd API root CA:
gcloud privateca roots create etcd-api-root-ca \
--pool = etcd-api-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--kms-key-version = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/etcd-api-ca-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1 \
--subject = "CN=etcd-api-ca, O= ORGANIZATION " \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID \
--auto-enable
Create the aggregation CA pool:
gcloud privateca pools create aggregation-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--tier = enterprise \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID \
--no-publish-crl --no-publish-ca-cert
Create the aggregation root CA:
gcloud privateca roots create aggregation-root-ca \
--pool = aggregation-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--kms-key-version = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/aggregation-ca-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1 \
--subject = "CN=aggregation-ca, O= ORGANIZATION " \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID \
--auto-enable
Grant IAM roles to the GKE service agent
The
GKE service agent
requires access to the resources that you created in Cloud KMS and in
CA Service. The service agent uses these resources to sign,
verify, and issue credentials in the cluster. You can use the following
predefined IAM roles:
Kubernetes Engine KMS Crypto Key User
( roles/container.cloudKmsKeyUser )
CA Service Certificate Manager
( roles/privateca.certificateManager )
To grant these roles to the GKE service agent, do the following:
Find the project number of your cluster project:
gcloud projects describe CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID \
--format = 'value(projectNumber)'
Replace CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID with the project ID of
your cluster project.
Grant the Kubernetes Engine KMS Crypto Key User role on the service account
signing key that you created in Create keys :
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding sa-signing-key \
--location = LOCATION \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER @container-engine-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = roles/container.cloudKmsKeyUser \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Replace CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER with the project
number of the cluster project.
Grant the CA Service Certificate Manager role on the CA pools that you
created in Create the CAs :
gcloud privateca pools add-iam-policy-binding cluster-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER @container-engine-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = roles/privateca.certificateManager \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca pools add-iam-policy-binding etcd-peer-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER @container-engine-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = roles/privateca.certificateManager \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca pools add-iam-policy-binding etcd-api-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER @container-engine-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = roles/privateca.certificateManager \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca pools add-iam-policy-binding aggregation-ca-pool \
--location = LOCATION \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- CLUSTER_PROJECT_NUMBER @container-engine-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role = roles/privateca.certificateManager \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Grant additional roles when not using the gcloud CLI
This section describes additional configuration steps that you must perform if
you plan to configure your CAs and keys by using a client like Terraform or
the Google Cloud console instead of using the gcloud CLI. If you
use the gcloud CLI, skip this section and go to the
Set up CAs and keys on a new cluster section.
When you use the gcloud CLI to set up your CAs and keys, as
described in this page, the gcloud CLI automatically creates and
configures a service agent for CA Service and grants
IAM roles to the service agent. However, if you use a client like
Terraform or the Google Cloud console to configure your Google Cloud
environment, you must perform these configuration steps manually as follows for
your key project:
Trigger creation of the CA Service service agent.
Preview
— triggering service agent creation
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
gcloud beta services identity create --service = privateca.googleapis.com \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Find the project number of your key project:
gcloud projects describe KEY_PROJECT_ID \
--format = 'value(projectNumber)'
Grant the Viewer ( roles/viewer )
role and the
Cloud KMS CryptoKey Signer/Verifier
( roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier ) role on all of the root CA keys that you
created in the Create keys section:
for key in cluster-ca-key etcd-peer-ca-key etcd-api-ca-key aggregation-ca-key
do
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding $key \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--role = roles/viewer \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- KEY_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-privateca.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding $key \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--role = roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier \
--member = "serviceAccount:service- KEY_PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-privateca.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
done
Replace KEY_PROJECT_NUMBER with the key project
number from the output of the previous step.
This command is a for loop that iterates through the root CA keys,
granting each role on that key to the CA Service service
agent. If you used different names for the root CA keys, run these commands
manually for each key.
Set up CAs and keys on a new cluster
Warning: Deleting keys or CAs that are in use by the cluster might lead to
irrecoverable clusters. Before you delete keys or CAs, ensure that your cluster
no longer uses the resources.
After you create keys, CA pools, root CAs, and grant IAM roles to
the GKE service agent, create a new cluster that uses these
resources.
The flags that you specify in the cluster creation command require the
following resource paths as values:
Path to a key version in Cloud KMS for the service
account signing key that you created in Create keys . You
specify this path for the service-account-signing-keys flag and for the
service-account-verification-keys flag.
Path to each of the CA pools that you created in
Create the CAs .
Note: Before you perform these steps, decide on whether you also want to encrypt
your control plane boot disks and etcd disks with keys that you manage. If you
do, perform all of the key configuration steps in
Encrypt etcd and control plane boot disks
and specify the optional flags described in the cluster creation command in this
section.
To configure a new cluster to use your keys and CAs, do the following steps:
Find the path to the latest enabled service account signing key version:
gcloud kms keys versions list \
--key = sa-signing-key \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--location = LOCATION \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID \
--filter = "STATE=ENABLED" --sort-by = ~ --format = "value(name)" | sed 1q
Replace KEY_PROJECT_ID with the project ID of the
key project.
The output is similar to the following:
projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/sa-signing-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1
Find the paths to each of the CA pools that you created:
gcloud privateca pools list --format = "get(name)" \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
The output is similar to the following:
projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/cluster-ca-pool
projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-peer-ca-pool
projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-api-ca-pool
projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/aggregation-ca-pool
Ensure that the output contains all of the CA pools that you created for
GKE.
Create a cluster
In this section, you create a cluster with different options specified
depending on which GKE control plane authority features you want to
configure. You can only configure these features on a cluster during cluster
creation. The following commands create Standard mode clusters. To
create Autopilot mode clusters instead, use the same flags with the
gcloud container clusters create-auto command.
To only configure the CAs and keys that you created in this tutorial, run the
following command:
gcloud container clusters create example-cluster \
--location = LOCATION \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID \
--cluster-version = VERSION \
--service-account-signing-keys = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/sa-signing-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1 \
--service-account-verification-keys = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/sa-signing-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1 \
--cluster-ca = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/cluster-ca-pool \
--etcd-peer-ca = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-peer-ca-pool \
--etcd-api-ca = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-api-ca-pool \
--aggregation-ca = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/aggregation-ca-pool
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the cluster
project.
VERSION : the GKE version of the
cluster. Must be 1.31.1-gke.1846000 or later.
To configure the CAs and keys as well as control plane boot disk encryption
and etcd encryption, do the following:
Perform all of the key configuration steps in
Encrypt etcd and control plane boot disks .
Find the paths to each of the keys by using the instructions in
Use encryption keys in a cluster .
Create a cluster:
gcloud container clusters create example-cluster \
--location = LOCATION \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID \
--cluster-version = VERSION \
--service-account-signing-keys = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/sa-signing-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1 \
--service-account-verification-keys = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/sa-signing-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1 \
--cluster-ca = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/cluster-ca-pool \
--etcd-peer-ca = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-peer-ca-pool \
--etcd-api-ca = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-api-ca-pool \
--aggregation-ca = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/aggregation-ca-pool \
--control-plane-disk-encryption-key = PATH_TO_DISK_KEY \
--gkeops-etcd-backup-encryption-key = PATH_TO_ETCD_BACKUP_KEY
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the
cluster project.
VERSION : the GKE version of the
cluster. Must be 1.31.1-gke.1846000 or later.
PATH_TO_DISK_KEY : the path to your disk
encryption key.
PATH_TO_ETCD_BACKUP_KEY : the path to your etcd
internal backup encryption key.
You can also use these flags when you create a new Standard mode
cluster.
Verify that the cluster uses your specified keys and CAs
This section shows you how to verify the keys and CAs that were used during
cluster creation. You can perform this verification using Cloud Logging or
by using the Google Cloud CLI.
Use Logging to verify keys and CAs
To verify the keys and CAs using Logging, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Logs Explorer page:
Go to Logs Explorer
Specify the following query:
resource . type = "gke_cluster"
resource . labels . cluster_name = " CLUSTER_NAME "
resource . labels . location = " CLUSTER_LOCATION "
protoPayload . serviceName = "container.googleapis.com"
protoPayload . methodName =~ "google.container.v(1|1alpha1|1beta1).ClusterManager.CreateCluster"
protoPayload . request . cluster . userManagedKeysConfig : *
protoPayload.request.cluster.userManagedKeysConfig:* filters the results
for cluster creation logs that include keys and CAs that you manage.
Click Run query .
In the results, expand your cluster creation log. Verify that the paths to
keys and CAs are the same as those that you created for that cluster, like in the following example:
# lines omitted for clarity
userManagedKeysConfig: {
aggregationCa: "projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/aggregation-ca-pool"
clusterCa: "projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/cluster-ca-pool"
etcdApiCa: "projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-api-ca-pool"
etcdPeerCa: "projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-peer-ca-pool"
serviceAccountSigningKeys: [
0: "projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/sa-signing-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1"
]
serviceAccountVerificationKeys: [
0: "projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY_RING_NAME /cryptoKeys/sa-signing-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1"
]
}
Use the gcloud CLI to verify keys and CAs
To verify that the cluster uses the CAs and keys that you created, run the
following command:
gcloud container clusters describe example-cluster \
--location = LOCATION \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID
The output should include the userManagedKeysConfig field like in the
following example:
# lines omitted for clarity
userManagedKeysConfig:

Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the projects
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete individual resources
Delete the cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete example-cluster \
--location = LOCATION \
--project = CLUSTER_PROJECT_ID
Disable the root CAs:
gcloud privateca roots disable cluster-root-ca \
--location = LOCATION \
--pool = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/cluster-ca-pool \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca roots disable etcd-peer-root-ca \
--location = LOCATION \
--pool = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-peer-ca-pool \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca roots disable etcd-api-root-ca \
--location = LOCATION \
--pool = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-api-ca-pool \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca roots disable aggregation-root-ca \
--location = LOCATION \
--pool = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/aggregation-ca-pool \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Delete the root CAs:
gcloud privateca roots delete cluster-root-ca \
--location = LOCATION \
--pool = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/cluster-ca-pool \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca roots delete etcd-peer-root-ca \
--location = LOCATION \
--pool = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-peer-ca-pool \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca roots delete etcd-api-root-ca \
--location = LOCATION \
--pool = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/etcd-api-ca-pool \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca roots delete aggregation-root-ca \
--location = LOCATION \
--pool = projects/ KEY_PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /caPools/aggregation-ca-pool \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Delete the CA pools:
gcloud privateca pools delete cluster-ca-pool --location = LOCATION \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca pools delete etcd-peer-ca-pool --location = LOCATION \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca pools delete etcd-api-ca-pool --location = LOCATION \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud privateca pools delete aggregation-ca-pool --location = LOCATION \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
Delete the keys:
gcloud kms keys versions destroy 1 \
--location = LOCATION \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--key = sa-signing-key \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud kms keys versions destroy 1 \
--location = LOCATION \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--key = cluster-ca-key \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud kms keys versions destroy 1 \
--location = LOCATION \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--key = etcd-peer-ca-key \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud kms keys versions destroy 1 \
--location = LOCATION \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--key = etcd-api-ca-key \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
gcloud kms keys versions destroy 1 \
--location = LOCATION \
--keyring = KEY_RING_NAME \
--key = aggregation-ca-key \
--project = KEY_PROJECT_ID
You can't delete key rings from Cloud KMS. However, key rings don't
incur additional costs.
