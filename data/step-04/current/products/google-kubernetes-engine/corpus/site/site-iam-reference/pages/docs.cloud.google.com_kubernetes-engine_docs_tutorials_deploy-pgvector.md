This tutorial shows you how to deploy a PostgreSQL
vector database cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
PostgreSQL comes with a range of modules and extensions
that extend the database's functionality. In this tutorial, you install the pgvector extension on an existing PostgreSQL cluster deployed to GKE. The
Pgvector extension lets you store vectors in the database tables by adding vector
types to PostgreSQL. Pgvector also provides similarity searches by running common
SQL queries.
We simplify the PGvector extension deployment by first deploying the CloudnativePG
operator, as the operator provides a bundled version of the extension.
This tutorial is intended for cloud platform administrators and architects ,
ML engineers , and MLOps
(DevOps) professionals interested in deploying PostgreSQL
database clusters on GKE.
Objectives
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
Deploy GKE infrastructure for PostgreSQL.
Install pgvector extension on the PostgreSQL cluster deployed to
GKE.
Deploy and configure the CloudNativePG PostgreSQL operator with Helm.
Upload a demo dataset and run search queries with Jupyter Notebook.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up .
Before you begin
In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell to
run commands. Cloud Shell is a shell environment for managing
resources hosted on Google Cloud. It comes preinstalled with the
Google Cloud CLI , kubectl ,
Helm and Terraform
command-line tools. If you don't use Cloud Shell, you must install the Google Cloud CLI.
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Cloud Resource Manager, Compute Engine, GKE,
and IAM Service Account Credentials APIs:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com iamcredentials.googleapis.com
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Note: If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have
the latest version by running gcloud components update .
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init

Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Cloud Resource Manager, Compute Engine, GKE,
and IAM Service Account Credentials APIs:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com iamcredentials.googleapis.com
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/compute.securityAdmin, roles/compute.viewer, roles/container.clusterAdmin, roles/container.admin, roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin, roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Set up your environment
To set up your environment with Cloud Shell, follow these steps:
Set environment variables for your project, region, and a Kubernetes
cluster resource prefix:
export PROJECT_ID = PROJECT_ID
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX = postgres
export REGION = us-central1
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud
project ID.
This tutorial uses the us-central1 region.
Clone the sample code repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
Navigate to the postgres-pgvector directory:
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/databases/postgres-pgvector
Create your cluster infrastructure
In this section, you run a Terraform script to create a private, highly-available,
regional GKE cluster to deploy your PostgreSQL database.
You can choose to deploy PostgreSQL using a
Standard or Autopilot cluster .
Each has its own advantages and different pricing models.
Autopilot
To deploy the Autopilot cluster infrastructure, run the following commands in the Cloud Shell:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = ../postgresql-cloudnativepg/terraform/gke-autopilot init
terraform -chdir = ../postgresql-cloudnativepg/terraform/gke-autopilot apply \
-var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
GKE replaces the following variables at runtime:
GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN uses the gcloud auth print-access-token
command to retrieve an access token that authenticates interactions with
various Google Cloud APIs
PROJECT_ID , REGION , and KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX are the environment
variables defined in the Set up your environment section and assigned
to the new relevant variables for the Autopilot cluster you are creating.
When prompted, type yes .
Terraform creates the following resources:
A custom VPC network and private subnet for the Kubernetes nodes.
A Cloud Router to access the internet through Network Address Translation (NAT).
A private GKE cluster in the us-central1 region.
A ServiceAccount with logging and monitoring permissions for the cluster.
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus configuration for
cluster monitoring and alerting.
The output is similar to the following:
...
Apply complete! Resources: 11 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
...
Standard
To deploy the Standard cluster infrastructure, run the following commands in the Cloud Shell:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = ../postgresql-cloudnativepg/terraform/gke-standard init
terraform -chdir = ../postgresql-cloudnativepg/terraform/gke-standard apply \
-var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
GKE replaces the following variables at runtime:
GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN uses the gcloud auth print-access-token
command to retrieve an access token that authenticates interactions with
various Google Cloud APIs.
PROJECT_ID , REGION , and KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX are the environment variables
defined in Set up your environment section and assigned to the new
relevant variables for the Standard cluster that you are creating.
When prompted, type yes . It might take several minutes for these commands to
complete and for the cluster to show a ready status.
Terraform creates the following resources:
A custom VPC network and private subnet for the Kubernetes nodes.
A Cloud Router to access the internet through Network Address Translation (NAT).
A private GKE cluster in the us-central1 region with autoscaling enabled
(one to two nodes per zone).
A ServiceAccount with logging and monitoring permissions for the cluster.
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus configuration for cluster monitoring and alerting.
The output is similar to the following:
...
Apply complete! Resources: 14 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
...
Connect to the cluster
Configure kubectl to fetch credentials and communicate with your new GKE cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials \
${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX } -cluster --location ${ REGION } --project ${ PROJECT_ID }
Deploy the CloudNativePG operator
Deploy the CloudNativePG to your Kubernetes cluster using a Helm chart:
Check the version of Helm:
helm version
Update the version if it's older than 3.13:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
Add the CloudNativePG operator Helm Chart repository:
helm repo add cnpg https://cloudnative-pg.github.io/charts
Deploy the CloudNativePG operator using the Helm command-line tool:
helm upgrade --install cnpg \
--namespace cnpg-system \
--create-namespace \
cnpg/cloudnative-pg
The output is similar to the following:
Release "cnpg" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: cnpg
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Oct 13 13:52:36 2023
NAMESPACE: cnpg-system
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
...
Deploy the PostgreSQL vector database
In this section, you deploy the PostgreSQL vector database.
Create a namespace pg-ns for the database:
kubectl create ns pg-ns
Apply the manifest to deploy PostgreSQL cluster. The cluster manifest enables
the pgvector extension.
kubectl apply -n pg-ns -f manifests/01-basic-cluster/postgreSQL_cluster.yaml
The postgreSQL_cluster.yaml manifest describes the Deployment:
apiVersion : postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind : Cluster

Check the status of the cluster:
kubectl get cluster -n pg-ns --watch
Wait for the output to show a status of Cluster in healthy state before you move to the next step.
Run queries with a Vertex AI Colab Enterprise notebook
In this section, you upload vectors into a PostgreSQL table and run
semantic search queries by using SQL syntax.
You connect to your PostgreSQL database by using Colab Enterprise.
You use a dedicated runtime template to deploy to the postgres-vpc , so the
notebook can communicate with resources in the GKE cluster.
For more information about Vertex AI Colab Enterprise, see
Colab Enterprise documentation .
Create a runtime template
To create a Colab Enterprise runtime template:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Colab Enterprise Runtime Templates
page and make sure your project is selected:
Go to Runtime Templates
Click add_box New Template . The
Create new runtime template page appears.
In the Runtime basics section:
In the Display name field, enter pgvector-connect .
In the Region drop-down list, select us-central1 . It's the same region as your GKE cluster.
In the Configure compute section:
In the Machine type drop-down list, select e2-standard-2 .
In the Disk size field, enter 30 .
In the Networking and security section:
In the Network drop-down list, select the network where your
GKE cluster resides.
In the Subnetwork drop-down list, select a corresponding subnetwork.
Clear the Enable public internet access checkbox.
To finish creating the runtime template, click Create . Your runtime template
appears in the list on the Runtime templates tab.
Create a runtime
To create a Colab Enterprise runtime:
In the runtime templates list for the template you just created, in the Actions column,
click more_vert and then
click Create runtime . The Create Vertex AI Runtime pane appears.
To create a runtime based on your template, click Create .
On the Runtimes tab that opens, wait for the status to transition to Healthy .
Import the notebook
To import the notebook in Colab Enterprise:
Go to the My Notebooks tab and click Import . The Import notebooks
pane appears.
In Import source , select URL .
Under Notebook URLs , enter the following link:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epam/kubernetes-engine-samples/internal_lb/databases/postgres-pgvector/manifests/02-notebook/vector-database.ipynb
Click Import .
Connect to the runtime and run queries
To connect to the runtime and run queries:
In the notebook, next to the Connect button, click arrow_drop_down Additional connection options .
The Connect to Vertex AI Runtime pane appears.
Select Connect to a runtime and then select Connect to an existing Runtime .
Select the runtime that you launched and click Connect .
To run the notebook cells, click the Run cell button next to each code cell.
The notebook contains both code cells and text that describes each code block. Running
a code cell executes its commands and displays an output. You can run the cells
in order, or run individual cells as needed.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
Delete the project
The easiest way to avoid billing is to delete the project you created for
this tutorial.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
If you deleted the project, your clean up is complete. If you didn't delete the
project, proceed to delete the individual resources.
Delete individual resources
Set environment variables.
export PROJECT_ID = ${ PROJECT_ID }
export KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX = postgres
export REGION = us-central1
Run the terraform destroy command:
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = $( gcloud auth print-access-token )
terraform -chdir = ../postgresql-cloudnativepg/terraform/ FOLDER destroy \
-var project_id = ${ PROJECT_ID } \
-var region = ${ REGION } \
-var cluster_prefix = ${ KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_PREFIX }
Replace FOLDER with either gke-autopilot or
gke-standard , depending on the type of GKE cluster you created .
When prompted, type yes .
