Standard
This document describes the audit logging policy in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
This document assumes that you know about the following:
Audit logging in GKE
Auditing in Kubernetes
GKE captures and records events in your cluster, and several
factors influence what information is logged, where that information is stored,
and policies that influence what you view in your audit logs.
This document is for Security specialists who want to gain insight into
activities occurring in your clusters so you can monitor for security threats,
track changes, and troubleshoot issues. To learn more about common roles and
example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
To learn how to enable and view the different types of audit logs, and to learn
about the required IAM permissions, see
GKE audit logging information .
Overview of audit policies
In a GKE cluster, the Kubernetes API server writes audit log
entries to a backend that is managed by GKE. As
GKE receives log entries from the Kubernetes API server, it
writes them to your project's Admin Activity log and Data Access log.
There are two policies that influence what you see in your project's audit
logs:
The Kubernetes audit policy defines rules for which events are recorded as
log entries. It also specifies what data the log entries should include.
The GKE audit policy determines which entries are written
to your Admin Activity log and which are written to your Data Access log.
The audit logs that are written to your Data Access log depend on your audit log
configuration. Data Access logs use the
Google Cloud Observability pricing .
Admin Activity logs are offered at no charge. GKE supports the
following types of Data Access logs.
ADMIN_READ : operations that read metadata about Kubernetes resources, such
as listing Pods.
DATA_READ : operations that read data in Kubernetes resources, such as
reading the logs for a Pod.
DATA_WRITE : operations that write data to Kubernetes resources, such
as updating Pod status.
For more information, see Configure Data Access audit logs .
Kubernetes audit policy
The Kubernetes API server follows a policy that is specified in the
--audit-policy-file flag of the
kube-apiserver
command.
When GKE starts the Kubernetes API server, it supplies an audit
policy file by setting the value of the --audit-policy-file flag. In the
open-source Kubernetes repository, you can see the
configure-helper.sh
script, which generates the audit policy file. You can see most of the audit
policy file by looking directly at the script.
Events and stages
When a person or component makes a request to the Kubernetes API server, the
request goes through one or more stages :
Stage
Description
RequestReceived
The audit handler has received the request.
ResponseStarted
The response headers have been sent, but the response body has not been
sent.
ResponseComplete
The response body has been completed, and no more bytes will be sent.
Panic
There was an internal server error, and the request did not complete..
Each stage of a request generates an event , which is processed according to a
policy. The policy specifies whether the event should be recorded as a log
entry and if so, what data should be included in the log entry.
Audit levels
The Kubernetes audit policy file contains a list of rules. In the policy file,
the first rule that matches an event sets the audit level for the event.
A rule can specify one of these audit levels:
Level
Description
None
Do not create a log entry for the event.
Metadata
Create a log entry. Include metadata, but do not include the request
body or the response body.
Request
Create a log entry. Include metadata and the request body, but do not
include the response body.
RequestResponse
Create a log entry. Include metadata, the request body, and the
response body.
Here's an example of a rule. If an event matches the rule, the Kubernetes API
server creates a log entry at the Request level.
- level: Request
userGroups: ["system:nodes"]
verbs: ["update","patch"]
resources:
- group: "" # core
resources: ["nodes/status", "pods/status"]
omitStages:
- "RequestReceived"
An event matches the rule if all of the following are true:
The event does not match any previous rule in the policy file.
The identity making the call is in the system:nodes user group.
The call is an update request or a patch request.
The request is on a nodes/status resource or a pods/status resource.
The event is not for the RequestReceived stage of the call.
GKE audit policy
As GKE receives log entries from the Kubernetes API server, it
applies its own policy to determine which entries get written to your project's
Admin Activity log and which entries get written to your project's Data Access
log.
For the most part, GKE applies the following rules to log entries
that come from the Kubernetes API server:
Entries that represent create , delete , and update requests go to your
Admin Activity log.
Entries that represent get , list , and updateStatus requests go to your
Data Access log.
For information about pricing and which types of logs are enabled by default,
see Logging details .
Kubernetes audit policy file for GKE clusters
For GKE clusters, the Kubernetes audit policy file starts with
rules that specify that certain events should not be logged at all. For
example, this rule says that any get request by kubelet on a nodes
resource or a nodes/status resource should not be logged. Recall that a
level of None means that any matching event should not be logged:
- level: None
users: ["kubelet"] # legacy kubelet identity
verbs: ["get"]
resources:
- group: "" # core
resources: ["nodes", "nodes/status"]
After the list of level: None rules, the policy file has a list of rules that
are special cases. For example, here's a special-case rule says to log certain
requests at the Metadata level:
- level: Metadata
resources:
- group: "" # core
resources: ["secrets", "configmaps"]
- group: authentication.k8s.io
resources: ["tokenreviews"]
omitStages:
- "RequestReceived"
An event matches the rule if all of the following are true:
The event does not match any previous rule in the policy file.
The request is on a resource of type secrets , configmaps , or
tokenreviews .
The event is not for the RequestReceived stage of the call.
After the list of special-case rules, the policy file has some general rules.
To see the general rules in the
script ,
you have to substitute the value of known_apis for ${known_apis} . After the
substitution, you get a rule like this:
- level: Request
verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
resources:
- group: "" # core
- group: "admissionregistration.k8s.io"
- group: "apiextensions.k8s.io"
- group: "apiregistration.k8s.io"
- group: "apps"
- group: "authentication.k8s.io"
- group: "authorization.k8s.io"
- group: "autoscaling"
- group: "batch"
- group: "certificates.k8s.io"
- group: "extensions"
- group: "metrics.k8s.io"
- group: "networking.k8s.io"
- group: "policy"
- group: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
- group: "settings.k8s.io"
- group: "storage.k8s.io"
omitStages:
- "RequestReceived"
The rule applies to events that do not match any previous rule in the policy
file and are not at the RequestReceived stage. The rule says that get ,
list , and watch requests on any resource that belongs to one of the listed
groups should be logged at the Request level.
Note: The get , list , and watch requests don't actually have a request
body, so in effect, the rule says to create log entries at the Metadata
level.
The next rule in the policy file looks like this:
- level: RequestResponse
resources:
- group: "" # core
- group: "admissionregistration.k8s.io"
- group: "apiextensions.k8s.io"
- group: "apiregistration.k8s.io"
- group: "apps"
- group: "authentication.k8s.io"
- group: "authorization.k8s.io"
- group: "autoscaling"
- group: "batch"
- group: "certificates.k8s.io"
- group: "extensions"
- group: "metrics.k8s.io"
- group: "networking.k8s.io"
- group: "policy"
- group: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
- group: "settings.k8s.io"
- group: "storage.k8s.io"
omitStages:
- "RequestReceived"
The rule applies to events that do not match any previous rule in the policy
file and are not at the RequestReceived stage. In particular, the rule does
not apply to the read requests: get , list , and watch . Instead, the rule
applies to write requests like create , update , and delete . The rule says
that write requests should be logged at the RequestResponse level.
Summary of Kubernetes audit policy for GKE clusters
The following list summarizes the Kubernetes audit policy for
GKE clusters:
In general, write requests like create , update , and delete are logged at
the RequestResponse level.
In general, get , list , and watch events are logged at the Metadata
level.
Some events are treated as special cases. For a definitive list of requests
that are treated as special cases, see the policy
script
Special cases include the following:
Update and patch requests by kubelet ,
system:node-problem-detector , or
system:serviceaccount:kube-system:node-problem-detector on a
nodes/status resource or a pods/status resource
are logged at the Request level.
Update and patch requests by any identity in the system:nodes group on a
nodes/status resource or a pods/status resource are logged at the
Request level.
deletecollection requests by
system:serviceaccount:kube-system:namespace-controller are logged at the
Request level.
Requests on a secrets resource, a configmaps resource, or a
tokenreviews resource are logged at the Metadata level.
Certain requests are not logged at all. For a definitive list of requests
that are not logged, see the level: None rules in the policy
script .
The following requests are not logged:
Requests by system:kube-proxy to watch an endpoints resource, a
services resource, or a services/status resource.
Get requests by system:unsecured on a configmaps resource in the
kube-system namespace.
Get requests by kubelet on a nodes resource or a nodes/status
resource.
Get requests by any identity in the system:nodes group on a nodes
resource or a nodes/status resource.
Get and update requests by system:kube-controller-manager ,
system:kube-scheduler , or system:serviceaccount:endpoint-controller
on an endpoints resource in the kube-system namespace.
Get requests by system:apiserver on a namespaces resource, a
namespaces/status resource, or a namespaces/finalize resource.
Get and list requests by system:kube-controller-manager on any resource
in the metrics.k8s.io group.
Requests to URLs that match /healthz* , /version , or /swagger* .
