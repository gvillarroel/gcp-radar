This document describes the Linux secure computing mode (seccomp)
in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This document assumes that you know about the
following:
Seccomp
Seccomp commands
Use the information in this document to understand which actions your
containerized applications can perform on the host virtual machine (VM) that
backs your nodes.
This document is for Security specialists who use seccomp as part of their
organization's security strategy and want to understand how GKE
interacts with seccomp profiles. To learn more about common roles and example
tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
What is seccomp?
Secure computing mode, or seccomp, is a security capability in Linux that lets
you restrict the system calls (syscalls) that a process can make to the Linux
kernel.
By default, GKE nodes use the Container-Optimized OS
operating system
with the containerd container runtime .
containerd protects the Linux kernel by limiting the allowed Linux
capabilities to a default list, and you can further limit allowed
syscalls with a seccomp profile . containerd has a default seccomp profile
available. Whether GKE applies the default seccomp profile for
you depends on the cluster mode that you use, as follows:
Autopilot (recommended):
GKE applies the containerd default seccomp profile to all
workloads automatically.
Standard :
GKE does not apply the containerd default seccomp profile
to all workloads automatically. We recommend that you apply either the
default seccomp profile or a custom seccomp profile
to your workloads.
The default containerd seccomp profile provides baseline hardening while
maintaining compatibility with most workloads. The full seccomp profile
definition for containerd is available on
GitHub .
Linux capabilities and syscalls
Non-root processes running on Linux systems might require specific privileges to
perform actions as the root user. Linux uses capabilities to divide the
available privileges into groups, so that a non-root process can perform a
specific action without being granted all privileges. For a process to
successfully make a specific syscall, the process must have the corresponding
privileges granted by a capability.
For a list of all Linux capabilities, refer to
capabilities
.
Denied syscalls in the default GKE seccomp profile
The containerd default seccomp profile blocks all syscalls and then selectively
allows specific syscalls, some of which depend on the CPU architecture of the
node's VM and the kernel version. The
syscalls variable in the DefaultProfile function
lists the allowed syscalls for all architectures.
The default seccomp profile blocks syscalls that can be used to bypass container
isolation boundaries and allow privileged access to the node or to other
containers. The following table describes some of the significant syscalls that
the default seccomp profile denies:
Denied syscalls
mount , umount , umount2 ,
fsmount , mount_setattr
Restrict processes from accessing or manipulating the node filesystem
outside of the container boundaries.
Also denied because the
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
is dropped.
bpf
Restrict processes from creating eBPF programs in the kernel, which
can lead to privilege escalation on the node. For example,
CVE-2021-3490
used the bpf syscall. Also denied because the
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
is dropped.
clone , clone3 , unshare
Restrict processes from creating new processes in new namespaces
that might be outside the container's restricted namespace. These new
processes might have elevated permissions and capabilities. For example,
CVE-2022-0185
used the unshare syscall. Also denied because the
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
is dropped.
reboot
Restrict processes from rebooting the node.
Denied because the
CAP_SYS_BOOT capability
is dropped.
open_by_handle_at , name_to_handle_at
Restrict access to files outside of the container. These syscalls
were used in one of the earliest
Docker container escape exploits . Also denied because the
CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability
and the
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
are dropped.
Note: This table only describes a subset of the syscalls that the default
seccomp profile blocks. For a full list, refer to the
profile definition on GitHub .
How to use seccomp in GKE
In Autopilot clusters, GKE automatically applies the
containerd default seccomp profile to all your workloads. No further action is
required. Attempts to make restricted syscalls fail. Autopilot
disallows custom seccomp profiles because GKE manages the nodes.
In Standard clusters, you must manually apply a seccomp profile.
GKE doesn't apply a profile for you.
Enable seccomp in Standard clusters
Apply a seccomp profile manually by setting the Pod or container
Security Context
using the spec.securityContext.seccompProfile field in the Pod specification,
such as in the following example. We strongly recommend that you use a seccomp
profile for your workloads unless your use case requires using any restricted
syscalls. The two supported seccompProfile types are as follows:
RuntimeDefault : the default profile specified by the containerd runtime.
Localhost : a custom profile definition .
The following example manifest sets the seccomp profile to the runtime default
profile:
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : my-deployment
labels :
app : default-pod
spec :
replicas : 3
selector :
matchLabels :
app : default-pod
template :
metadata :
labels :
app : default-pod
spec :
securityContext :
seccompProfile :
type : RuntimeDefault
containers :
- name : seccomp-test
image : nginx
Important: You can't apply a seccomp profile to containers that run in
Privileged mode .
When you deploy this manifest, if a container in the Pod tries to make a syscall
that violates the runtime default seccomp profile, the Pod or the workload might
experience unexpected behavior. For example, a Pod that makes a restricted
syscall during startup would fail to start. If an application tries to make a
restricted syscall while the Pod is running, you might notice errors in the
container. The severity of a failed syscall depends on how the application
handles errors.
Use a custom seccomp profile in Standard clusters
If the runtime default seccomp profile is too restrictive for your application
(or not restrictive enough), you can apply a custom seccomp profile to Pods in
Standard clusters. This process requires access to the filesystem on
the node. For a tutorial on how to load and use custom seccomp profiles, refer
to
Restrict a Container's Syscalls with seccomp .
