This page describes how Google Cloud and
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) maintain compliance with the
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
as you process and transmit data through your GKE clusters that
run on Google Cloud.
This page is intended for security managers, security engineers, and
compliance officers who want to meet strict data security and privacy
requirements related to FIPS. You can also use this page to show an auditor that
GKE on Google Cloud implements FIPS-validated
protections for data security by default.
Key takeaways about FIPS-validated encryption in GKE
The FedRAMP® security controls for data encryption in transit (SC-28) and
at rest (SC-8(1)) require that your data is encrypted using FIPS 140-2
validated cryptographic modules or newer. These security controls don't
explicitly mandate enabling "FIPS mode" at the operating system (OS) level.
Additionally, OS-level FIPS mode isn't a guarantee of compliance.
Data that's stored in FedRAMP authorized Google Cloud systems is
encrypted at rest by default using FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules
or newer. As long as your data is stored in these authorized systems, the data
meets the FedRAMP requirements for protecting data at rest (security control
SC-28). For a list of authorized systems, see the
FedRAMP High services in scope .
Data that you transmit inside the Google Cloud
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network is automatically encrypted and is protected
by authentication and authorization mechanisms. VPC is
authorized at FedRAMP High. As long as your data is being transmitted within
the Google Cloud VPC network, the data meets the FedRAMP
requirements for protecting data in transit (security control SC-8(1)).
You don't need to build your applications using FIPS-compliant build
processes to meet the FedRAMP requirements for data protection at rest
and in transit. This is because data that's transmitted within the
Google Cloud VPC network and is stored in FedRAMP
authorized Google Cloud storage systems is protected in compliance with
these FedRAMP requirements for data protection by default.
About FIPS and FedRAMP
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a US
government program that defines a standardized approach to security and risk
assessment for cloud technologies. GKE is included in the list of
Google Cloud services that have FedRAMP High provisional authority to
operate (P-ATO). To learn more about the Google Cloud FedRAMP P-ATO, see
the Google Cloud FedRAMP overview .
FIPS is a publicly announced set of standards issued by the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST). FIPS publication 140-2 defines the
requirements for approving cryptographic modules. For details, see
FIPS 140-2 on NIST .
The FedRAMP High P-ATO includes controls for protecting data in transit
(SC-8(1)) and protecting data at rest (SC-28(1)) using FIPS-validated
cryptographic modules.
Default FIPS-validated data protection in GKE
The following sections explain how Google Cloud and GKE
implement FIPS-validated encryption to protect data at rest and in transit. This
information is covered in more detail in the Google Cloud system security
plan (SSP), which you can request from your Google Cloud sales team,
Google Cloud representative, or from the Google Cloud FedRAMP
Program Management Office if you're a government customer. For details, see
Google Cloud FedRAMP Compliance .
FIPS-validated data protection at rest
GKE data is encrypted at rest using a FIPS 140-2 validated
Google Cloud encryption module named BoringCrypto . For details, see
FIPS 140-2 validation in Google Cloud .

Encrypt your data in-transit in GKE with user-managed encryption keys
FIPS-validated data protection in transit
The Google Cloud VPC has a FedRAMP High P-ATO. Any data
that you transmit within your VPC network is automatically
encrypted. In GKE, this means that all traffic to and from
containers, Pods, the kubelet process on each node, all nodes, control plane
instances, and other Google Cloud services within the VPC
is protected in transit. All connections to Google APIs use transport layer
security (TLS) 1.2 or higher to encrypt network traffic. No additional action
is needed to be FIPS-compliant for data protection in transit within the
Google Cloud VPC network.
For more information about how your data is encrypted in transit, see the
Encryption in transit whitepaper .
Recommendations for protecting data outside of Google Cloud
The default encryption of data in transit for GKE and
Google Cloud apply only within the Google Cloud VPC
network. You must use FIPS-compliant cryptography to protect data that's outside
of the VPC network boundary. The following recommendations help
you to ensure that all incoming and outgoing data outside of your
Google Cloud FIPS environment in transit is encrypted with FIPS-compliant
cryptography.
Intercept and encrypt incoming traffic from the internet
For incoming traffic to your Google Cloud environment from the internet,
use SSL policies in Google Cloud load balancers to define an allowed set
of FIPS-validated cryptographic ciphers or mechanisms with which the data must
be protected when it enters the Google Cloud environment. For details, see
the following resources:
SSL policies for SSL and TLS protocols
Create SSL policies with a custom profile
Encryption between proxy load balancers and backends
Intercept and encrypt outbound traffic to the internet
Define a perimeter that limits outbound data connections to a set of known
third parties that you trust by
configuring firewalls . Diagram and document any
external network requirements, such as pulling data from sources like GitHub,
and where those external connections will occur within your environment.
Consider using a reverse proxy to intercept outbound traffic from your
VPC.
If you have HTTP traffic that's leaving the perimeter of your FedRAMP-compliant
Google Cloud environment, consider setting up an HTTP forward proxy to
intercept the data before it leaves the environment. Re-encrypt the data using
a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module before you allow it to leave your
perimeter. This approach is more manageable at scale than trying to ensure that
every internal client uses compliant encryption libraries for external
communication.
Enable private nodes
GKE lets you disable the external IP address for new nodes in
your clusters, so that workloads that run on the nodes can't communicate with
the internet by default. Use the http_proxy or https_proxy environment
variables to send all traffic to your configured HTTP proxy.
You can configure more transparent interception of this traffic with routing
rules. However, because you're proxying TLS traffic, the proxy can't be
completely transparent to the applications you run on GKE.

Restrict network access to the control plane and nodes
Use Cloud VPN for network layer connections to GKE
You might sometimes need an encrypted network layer connection to your
GKE clusters. For example, you might need to set up
FIPS-compliant networking between GKE nodes and on-premises
nodes. Cloud VPN is a FedRAMP High authorized service that encrypts your
data in transit between your VPC network and your on-premises
network. For details, see
Cloud VPN overview .
Use Cloud KMS for cryptographic operations
If you need to perform cryptographic operations in your Google Cloud
environment, use Cloud Key Management Service .
Cloud KMS is a FedRAMP High authorized service. Cloud KMS lets
you perform cryptographic operations that comply with either FIPS 140-2 Level 1
or Level 3. For details, see the following resources:
Key backends and protection levels
Raw symmetric encryption
Build FIPS-validated libraries in GKE workloads
To use the BoringCrypto encryption module in your GKE
applications, install BoringSSL. BoringSSL is an open source fork of OpenSSL
that includes the BoringCrypto library. To build, compile, and statically
link the BoringCrypto module to BoringSSL, see section 12.1, "Installation
Instructions", in
the BoringCrypto FIPS 140-2 Security Policy PDF
Consider third-party FIPS-compliant container images
We recommend that you use proxies at the boundary of your FIPS-compliant
Google Cloud environment to comprehensively enforce FIPS compliance. You
can also run FIPS-compliant workloads without being limited to node host
machines that have FIPS-compliant kernels. Some third-party vendors provide
container images that use a separate, FIPS-compliant source of entropy.
Ensure that you properly evaluate the third-party vendor's implementation to
ensure that it's actually FIPS-compliant.
