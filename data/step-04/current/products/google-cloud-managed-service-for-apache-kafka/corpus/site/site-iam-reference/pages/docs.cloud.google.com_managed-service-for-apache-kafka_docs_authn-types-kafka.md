This page describes the supported authentication methods for client applications
connecting to Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka brokers.
For Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka client applications running on Google Cloud services like
Google Kubernetes Engine, Compute Engine, Cloud Run, or
Cloud Run functions, you have the following authentication options:
SASL/OAUTHBEARER (recommended) : this is the most seamless and secure
method for clients within Google Cloud. It uses
Application Default Credentials (ADC)
to automatically find the service account identity associated with the
environment. This eliminates the need to manage and distribute static
credential files like service account keys.
SASL/PLAIN : this is a useful method for early development.
The client authenticates by using a long-lived service account key.
mTLS : this is an option if your organization's standard is
certificate-based authentication. Your application on Google Cloud
is configured with a client certificate and key.
For client applications running outside of Google Cloud, such as in an
on-premises data center or on another cloud provider, consider the following
authentication methods. Choose the best method based on your organization's
security posture and existing identity infrastructure.
Workload Identity Federation with SASL/OAUTHBEARER (recommended) :
this is the most secure method for external clients. It lets you grant
identities from external systems, such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or an
on-premises identity provider like ADFS, the ability to impersonate a
Google Cloud service account. Instead of managing long-lived service
account keys, the client uses its preferred credential to obtain a
short-lived Google Cloud access token. The client then uses this
token for authentication, which significantly reduces the security risk
associated with static credential files.
mTLS : this method is provider-agnostic and is a good fit if your
organization already uses a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to manage TLS
certificates for service identity. It allows clients to authenticate without
a Google Cloud-specific identity. However, similar to using service
account keys, this approach requires you to manage the lifecycle and
distribution of long-lived credentials, such as client certificates.
SASL/PLAIN with a service account key : this method provides a direct way
for an external client to authenticate as a Google Cloud identity.
You download a service account key JSON file and use it in your client's
SASL/PLAIN configuration. This method is generally discouraged for production
workloads because it requires managing and securing a long-lived static
credential on the client-side.
Feature comparison between SASL and mTLS
The primary authentication mechanism for Managed Service for Apache Kafka is SASL
(Simple Authentication and Security Layer), which integrates directly with
Google Cloud's identity services. As a baseline, SASL authenticates clients
using a Google Cloud IAM principal, such as a service
account. For authorization, SASL provides flexibility: you can manage access
to clusters using granular IAM roles and
Kafka's Access Control Lists (ACLs).
In contrast, mTLS offers a provider-agnostic authentication method
that does not rely on Google Cloud IAM. Instead,
mTLS authenticates a client based on its TLS certificate, where the identity
is derived from the certificate's Subject Name.
This distinction leads to a key difference in how authorization is handled.
Unlike SASL principals, mTLS principals must be authorized using Kafka ACLs
exclusively; they cannot be managed with Google Cloud IAM roles.
We strongly recommend configuring Kafka ACLs for your cluster. If no ACLs are
set, the default Kafka behavior grants all authenticated principals—whether
using SASL or mTLS—full access to the cluster. For more information about
how to configure Kafka ACLs, see
Create a Managed Service for Apache Kafka ACL .
Managed Service for Apache Kafka supports mTLS authentication with client
certificates issued by Certificate Authorities found in the
CA Service .
If your organization uses an external root of trust,
you can integrate it by creating a subordinate CA within CA Service that chains up to
your external CA .

Choose SASL versus mTLS
Your choice of authentication method is guided by your organization's security
policies and existing infrastructure. For most use cases, we recommend using
SASL with Google Cloud IAM.
SASL with Google Cloud IAM
or Workload Identity Federation provides the most flexible and integrated
experience for authentication and authorization. It uses Google Cloud's
identity system as the single source of truth for managing permissions. Choose
this path if you want to:
Centrally manage permissions for your Kafka clients using familiar
Google Cloud IAM roles.
Avoid managing static credentials on clients.
Enable clients from other clouds like AWS, Azure or on-premises identity
providers like Okta or ADFS to authenticate using
Workload Identity Federation This method provides a secure,
cloud-agnostic identity solution without needing to switch to a different
authentication protocol.
Choose mTLS if your organization has a strict requirement for
certificate-based authentication. This need arises when you are migrating an
existing on-premises Kafka deployment that already uses TLS certificates for
identity, or when corporate policy mandates client certificates for all
applications. While mTLS provides strong transport-level security, remember that
authorization for mTLS clients must be managed exclusively with Kafka ACLs,
which is separate from Google Cloud IAM.
Workflow for configuring SASL/PLAIN or SASL/OAUTHBEARER
Configuring a client to use SASL authentication with Managed Service for Apache Kafka
involves granting permissions to the client's identity and then configuring the
client application based on the chosen SASL mechanism. The following is an
overview of the required workflow. For detailed
instructions on how to configure SASL, see
Configure SASL authentication .
Grant IAM permissions . You must first grant the Managed Kafka Client
( roles/managedkafka.client ) role to the service account that your client
uses for authentication. This role provides the necessary
managedkafka.clusters.connect permission to connect to Kafka clusters
within the project.
Configure the Kafka client . The specific client configuration depends on
whether you use the SASL/OAUTHBEARER or SASL/PLAIN mechanism.
For SASL/OAUTHBEARER (recommended) : this mechanism uses Application
Default Credentials ADC. The configuration depends on your client's language:
Java clients : add the specialized Google Cloud authentication
library to your application's classpath. Then, configure the Kafka
client properties to use the provided GcpLoginCallbackHandler class,
which automatically handles authentication using ADC.
The GcpLoginCallbackHandler is a class used with Kafka's OAUTHBEARER
authentication mechanism, specifically designed for use with
Managed Service for Apache Kafka. It handles the process of obtaining a JSON Web
Token (JWT) from Google's identity provider, enabling Kafka clients to
authenticate with the service using ADC.
Non-Java clients : run a provided local authentication server on the
client's machine. This server uses ADC to fetch credentials and
provides them to the Kafka client. The client is then
configured to get its authentication token from this local server's
endpoint.
For SASL/PLAIN
This mechanism uses a username and password combination. The client
application must be configured to use the SASL_SSL security protocol,
the PLAIN mechanism, and a JAAS configuration that specifies the
PlainLoginModule class.
The username is the service account's email address. The password can be
generated in one of two ways:
By base64-encoding a service account key JSON file.
By obtaining a short-lived access token.
Configure authorization . After a client successfully authenticates using
SASL, its access is controlled by permissions defined in IAM roles or
Kafka ACLs on the cluster.
SASL limitations
The SASL authentication method has the following limitations:
SASL authentication is inherently tied to IAM principals. It is
not suitable for organizations that require a strict separation from
Google Cloud identity or that uses non-Google identities,
unless you configure Workload Identity Federation.
SASL does not use client certificates for authentication. It is not a direct
fit for organizations that rely on an existing PKI to identify applications.
Workflow for configuring mTLS
Configuring mTLS for Managed Service for Apache Kafka involves configuring certificate
authorities, the Kafka cluster, and your Kafka clients. For detailed
instructions on how to configure mTLS, see Configure mTLS authentication .
Configure Certificate Authorities (CAs) . You must first create and
configure CA pools in Certificate Authority Service (CA Service).
If you create CA pools that are in a different project, make sure to grant the
Managed Service for Apache Kafka service agent
( service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-managedkafka.iam.gserviceaccount.com ) permission
to access these pools. You must create root and subordinate certificates inside
the CA pools.
Configure the Kafka cluster . Create or update your cluster to enable
mTLS by providing the resource identifiers of your configured CA pools. We also
recommended configuring the ssl.principal.mapping.rules broker property to
create simplified principal names for use in ACLs. You can do so using
Google Cloud CLI commands.
Configure the Kafka clients . Obtain client certificates from your CAs
and install them in your client's environment, for example, in a Java
keystore. The client application must then be configured with the correct
security protocol (SSL) and the location of its keystore to connect to the
cluster's dedicated mTLS bootstrap port which is 9192 .
Monitor mTLS . After setup, monitor the
managedkafka.googleapis.com/mtls_truststore_update_count metric to verify
the cluster is successfully refreshing its CA certificates from the
CA Service pools, which it attempts to do periodically. You can also use
Cloud logging .
mTLS limitations
The mTLS feature has the following limitations:
You can only use the mTLS feature on Managed Service for Apache Kafka
clusters created after June 24, 2025.
You must configure authorization for mTLS principals using Kafka ACLs.
You cannot use IAM role bindings to authorize mTLS clients.
The service only authenticates clients that present certificates managed by
CA Service. However, you can integrate
an external root of trust by creating a subordinate CA within CA Service that
chains up to your external CA.
You can configure a cluster to trust a maximum of 10 CA pools.
