Access control with Kafka ACLs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes how to use Apache Kafka access control lists (ACLs)
for access control in Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka.
Apache Kafka ACLs provide fine-grained access
control within the Kafka cluster. Managed Service for Apache Kafka enables the
out-of-the-box StandardAuthorizer , which
stores ACLs in the KRaft-based Kafka cluster metadata.
These ACLs control which authenticated users can perform specific operations
on specific Kafka resources, like producing or consuming messages on a topic.
These ACLs are useful to control interactions with the cluster using
standard Apache Kafka clients, which are only subject to a cluster-level
IAM check for the initial connection. For more information, see Access control with IAM .
How Kafka ACL access control works
The client interacts with Kafka's standard ACL
authorizer within the cluster. The authorizer evaluates the relevant Apache
Kafka ACLs to authorize specific operations requested by the principal,
such as producing to a topic or consuming from a group. The principal used
for the ACL check is derived from one of the following authentication methods:
SASL: the IAM principal such as a service account email.
mTLS: the Distinguished Name (DN) from the client certificate,
potentially transformed by
principal mapping rules .
For comprehensive security, you must configure the following:
IAM permissions for management access. For more information, see Access control with IAM .
Kafka ACLs for in-cluster data access and operations from open-source Apache
Kafka clients, independent of the authentication method.
Usage of Apache Kafka ACLs
Apache Kafka ACL bindings have the following format:
Principal P is [Allowed/Denied] Operation O From Host H on any resource matching Resource Pattern RP.
The following is a list of important information about the format:
Principal(P): The user identity being authorized. This is prefixed with User: .
For SASL authentication, this is the IAM principal, such as
User:my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
For mTLS authentication, this is the Distinguished Name (DN) from the
client certificate, such as User:CN=my-client,OU=my-org-unit .
The exact format depends on the certificate's Subject.
Principal mapping rules
can transform this value.
Permission type(Allowed/Denied): whether the ACL binding allows or denies
access. Deny bindings take precedence.
Operation(O): the action performed such as Read, Write, or Create.
For information about which operations apply to which resources for various
Kafka protocols, see
Operations and Resources on Protocols
in the Apache Kafka documentation.
Host(H): the machine from which the request originates. Since
Managed Service for Apache Kafka translates client network addresses, use of hosts
other than '*' is not supported.
Resource Pattern(RP): a pattern used to match specific resources. A resource
pattern consists of a resource type, a resource name, and a pattern
type ( LITERAL or PREFIXED ).
Default access
Managed Service for Apache Kafka clusters operate with the Apache Kafka
property allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found set to true . The presence or absence
of Kafka ACLs directly dictates the level of access to resources:
If no Kafka ACLs are defined for a specific resource like a topic, all
authenticated principals are granted access to it. This configuration lets
Managed Service for Apache Kafka clusters be immediately operable, without the
requirement to configure ACLs.
As soon as you define any Kafka ACL for that resource, access becomes
restricted. Only principals explicitly granted permission using an ALLOW
entry in a Kafka ACL can access matching resources (unless specifically
blocked by a DENY entry).
Managed Service for Apache Kafka gives its
service agent administrative
access to your cluster. This access allows the service agent to perform
operations requested by the Managed Service for Apache Kafka API, regardless of other ACLs configured in the cluster. Managed Service for Apache Kafka accomplishes this by
modifying the StandardAuthorizer implementation. The modification grants the
service agent permissions similar to super users, except for read and write
operations. You cannot change this configuration.
Kafka principals
Kafka principals for Managed Service for Apache Kafka clusters are specified with the
Kafka StandardAuthorizer prefix "User:" .
For SASL/IAM: the principal is the
Google Cloud account. For example, to grant access to the service account
test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com ,
use the Kafka principal
"User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com" .
Kafka ACL principals must specify a user, a service account, or an individual
IAM principal, but not a group or principal set. Kafka ACLs
don't support resolving group memberships for Google Cloud principals.
For mTLS: the principal is derived from the client certificate's
Subject Distinguished Name (DN). For example,
User:CN=client1,OU=dev,O=MyOrg,L=City,ST=State,C=US .
You can use mTLS principal mapping rules
to transform the DN into a more user-friendly principal string for ACLs.
To create an ACL that applies to all members of a Google Group or principal set,
you can use a proxy service account principal and service account impersonation:
Create a service account to use
as a proxy for the group.
Grant the Google Group or principal set the
Service Account Token Creator role on
the service account. See Manage access to service accounts
Add Kafka ACLs for the proxy service account. An example principal would be:
User:group-proxy@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Use service account impersonation in Kafka
clients to authenticate to Kafka as the service account. Google Cloud
IAM authorizes an individual principal as a member of the
group that's allowed to impersonate the proxy service account. And Kafka
authorizes the proxy service account against existing ACLs in the cluster.
Kafka operations for producers and consumers
An operation is an action performed on a resource. For each resource,
an operation is mapped to one or more Kafka protocol requests for that resource.
For example, a READ operation for the topic resource type is mapped to
Fetch , OffsetCommit , and TxnOffsetCommit Apache Kafka protocols.
To grant a principal producer access on a topic, perform the following steps:
On the topic resource, allow the WRITE and CREATE operations.
If using transactional IDs, on the transactional ID resource, allow the
WRITE operation.
To grant a principal consumer access on a topic, perform the following steps:
On the topic resource, allow the READ operation.
On the consumer group resource, allow the READ operation.
For more information about the valid operations on resources that the
Kafka API supports, see
Operations and Resources on Protocols
in the Apache Kafka documentation.
Configure ACLS for default-deny behavior
Managed Kafka clusters are configured with
allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found = true .
So by default, if no ACLs are set on a resource, all principals
can access the resource.
To configure a default-deny behavior similar to that in IAM, you can
first configure access for an administrator user on all resources in the cluster.
As a result, every resource gets an ACL defined on it, and
the allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found behavior is suppressed.
By default, any principal not explicitly allowed by an ALLOW ACL is
denied access.
For example, to set ACLs on all resources in the cluster for the service
account clusterAdmin@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com ,
create the following ACL entries.
The following gcloud CLI command grants a service account
named clusterAdmin@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
full administrative access ( --operation=ALL ) to a specific Kafka cluster
located in a particular region. This permission allows the service
account to perform any operation on the cluster from any host.
gcloud managed-kafka acls add-acl-entry cluster \
--principal = ` User:clusterAdmin@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com ` \
--operation = ALL \
--permission-type = ALLOW \
--host = * \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
The following gcloud CLI command grants a service account
named clusterAdmin@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
full administrative access ( --operation=ALL ) to all topics within a
specific Kafka cluster located in a particular region. This permission allows
the service account to perform any operation on all topics from any host.
gcloud managed-kafka acls add-acl-entry allTopics \
--principal = ` User:clusterAdmin@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com ` \
--operation = ALL \
--permission-type = ALLOW \
--host = * \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
The following gcloud CLI command grants a service account
named clusterAdmin@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
full administrative access ( --operation=ALL ) to all consumer groups within
a specific Kafka cluster located in a particular region. This permission
allows the service account to perform any operation on all consumer
groups from any host.
gcloud managed-kafka acls add-acl-entry allConsumerGroups \
--principal = ` User:clusterAdmin@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com ` \
--operation = ALL \
--permission-type = ALLOW \
--host = * \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
The following gcloud CLI command grants a service account named
clusterAdmin@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
full administrative access ( --operation=ALL ) to all transactional IDs within a
specific Kafka cluster located in a particular region. This permission allows
the service account to perform any operation on all transactional IDs from any
host.
gcloud managed-kafka acls add-acl-entry allTransactionalIds \
--principal = ` User:clusterAdmin@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com ` \
--operation = ALL \
--permission-type = ALLOW \
--host = * \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
The following is a list of important information about the commands:
--principal='User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' :
the principal to whom the ACL applies. The principal is a
Google Cloud account, with the Kafka StandardAuthorizer prefix User: .
--operation=all : the Kafka operation being granted, which is
full access in this case.
--permission-type=ALLOW : this ACL entry grants access.
--host='*' : the host from which the principal can access the resource.
'*' grants access from any host. Managed Service for Apache Kafka only
supports ACLs with host '*' .
CLUSTER_ID : the name of your Managed Service for Apache Kafka
cluster.
LOCATION : the Google Cloud region where your
Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster is located such as us-central1 .
Configure ACLs
You can configure Apache Kafka ACLs with the Managed Service for Apache Kafka ACL APIs, or with
open-source Apache Kafka tools such as Apache Kafka authorizer cli
kafka-acls.sh ,
or Admin Client .
Managed Service for Apache Kafka organizes ACLs by Kafka resource patterns. The
resource pattern is defined by the following:
Resource type: cluster, topic, consumer group, or transactional ID
Pattern type: literal, or prefixed (all resources whose name start with the provided string)
Resource name: the resource name or prefix to which the ACL entries apply.
A Managed Service for Apache Kafka ACL resource represents all access control
configured for a single Kafka resource pattern, as a repeated list of ACL
entries. The name of the ACL resource uniquely identifies the resource
pattern of the ACL binding. For more information,
see ACL ID .
You can manage Managed Service for Apache Kafka ACLs at the ACL resource level (all ACL
entries for a resource pattern), or incrementally by adding and removing
individual ACL entries for an ACL resource pattern.
For more information, see
Create a Managed Kafka ACL
and Add a Managed Kafka ACL entry .
Allow reading from a topic
To allow open-source Apache Kafka clients running as the service account
test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
to read from the topic topic-name , create a Managed Service for Apache Kafka
ACL entry using the
managed-kafka acls add-acl-entry command :
gcloud managed-kafka acls add-acl-entry topic/topic-name \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
--principal = 'User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--operation = READ \
--permission-type = ALLOW \
--host = '*'
The following is a list of important information about the command:
topic/topic-name : specifies the Managed Service for Apache Kafka topic to which
you want to grant access. Replace topic-name with the actual name of your
topic. The topic/ prefix indicates that this ACL entry applies to a
specific (literal) topic resource pattern.
LOCATION : the Google Cloud region where your
Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster is located, such as us-central1 .
CLUSTER_ID : the name of your Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster.
--principal='User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' :
the principal to whom the ACL applies. The principal is a
Google Cloud account, with the Kafka StandardAuthorizer prefix User: .
--operation=READ : the Kafka operation being granted,
which is READ in this case.
--permission-type=ALLOW : indicates that this ACL entry grants
access.
--host='*' : specifies the host from which the principal can
access the resource. '*' grants access from any host.
Managed Service for Apache Kafka only supports ACLs with host '*' .
To remove read access, you can use the
remove-acl-entry command with the
same parameters.
gcloud managed-kafka acls remove-acl-entry topic/topic-name \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
--principal = 'User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--operation = READ \
--permission-type = ALLOW \
--host = '*'
Allow writing to all topics with a common prefix
To allow open-source Apache Kafka clients running as the service account
test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
to write to all topics whose name starts with the prefix topic-prefix ,
add a Managed Kafka ACL entry as follows:
gcloud managed-kafka acls add-acl-entry topicPrefixed/topic-prefix \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
--principal = 'User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--operation = WRITE \
--permission-type = ALLOW \
--host = '*'
The following is a list of important information about the command:
topicPrefixed/topic-prefix : specifies the Managed Service for Apache Kafka resource
pattern to which you want to grant access. Replace topic-prefix with the
actual prefix of your topics. The topicPrefixed/ prefix indicates that
this ACL entry applies to a prefixed resource pattern: all topics matching the
given prefix.
PROJECT : the ID of your Google Cloud project where
your Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster is located.
LOCATION : the Google Cloud region where your
Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster is located such as us-central1 .
CLUSTER_ID : the name of your Managed Service for Apache Kafka
cluster.
--principal='User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' :
the principal to
whom the ACL applies. The principal is a
Google Cloud account, with the Kafka StandardAuthorizer prefix User: .
--operation=WRITE : the Kafka operation being granted,
which is WRITE in this case.
--permission-type=ALLOW : this ACL entry grants access.
--host='*' : the host from which the principal can access the resource.
'*' grants access from any host. Managed Service for Apache Kafka only
supports ACLs with host '*' .
To remove write access for this service account, remove the ACL entry:
gcloud managed-kafka acls remove-acl-entry topicPrefixed/topic-prefix \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
--principal = 'User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--operation = WRITE \
--permission-type = ALLOW \
--host = '*'
Deny modifying all topics
To prevent open-source Apache Kafka clients running as the service account
test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
from modifying all topics in a cluster, you can create a
Managed Service for Apache Kafka ACL resource with a list of AclEntry
resources to deny the ALTER , ALTER_CONFIGS , and DELETE operations on all
topics. This approach defines the required state in a single configuration.
Alternatively, you can achieve the same result by imperatively adding three
separate ACL entries using the gcloud managed-kafka acls add-acl-entry command.
This method involves running the command to deny access to each of the operations
ALTER , ALTER_CONFIGS , and DELETE , as follows:
gcloud managed-kafka acls add-acl-entry allTopics \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
--principal = 'User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--operation = ALTER \
--permission-type = DENY \
--host = '*'
gcloud managed-kafka acls add-acl-entry allTopics \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
--principal = 'User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--operation = ALTER_CONFIGS \
--permission-type = DENY \
--host = '*'
gcloud managed-kafka acls add-acl-entry allTopics \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
--principal = 'User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--operation = DELETE \
--permission-type = DENY \
--host = '*'
The following information applies to each of the add-acl-entry commands:
allTopics : specifies that this ACL applies to all topics within the
Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster.
LOCATION : the Google Cloud region where
your Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster is located such as us-central1 .
CLUSTER_ID : the name of your Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster.
--principal='User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' :
specifies the principal to whom the ACL applies. The principal is a
Google Cloud account, with the Kafka StandardAuthorizer prefix User: .
--operation : specifies the Kafka operation being denied:
ALTER : includes actions like changing the number of partitions or
replication factor.
ALTER_CONFIGS : includes modifying topic-level configurations.
DELETE : includes deleting topics.
--permission-type=DENY : indicates that these ACL entries block
access for the specified operations.
--host='*' : specifies that this denial applies regardless of the
host from which the request originates. Managed Service for Apache Kafka only
supports ACLs with host '*' .
To remove these restrictions, use the remove-acl-entry command for each of
the added entries, using the same parameters. For example, to re-allow topic
deletion:
gcloud managed-kafka acls remove-acl-entry allTopics \
--cluster = CLUSTER_ID \
--location = LOCATION
--principal = 'User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--operation = DELETE \
--permission-type = DENY \
--host = '*'
Troubleshooting ACLs
The Apache Kafka Standard Authorizer writes audit logs by default on
authorization denials. If you receive a Kafka Authorization error, you can
confirm the principal, resource, and operation that was denied by searching
the cluster logs for StandardAuthorizerData logAuditMessage .
For example, here is a sample cluster log.
org.apache.kafka.metadata.authorizer.StandardAuthorizerData logAuditMessage \n
INFO: Principal = User:556291496362-compute@developer.iam.gserviceaccount.com is
Denied operation = DESCRIBE from host = 172 .16.0.20 on resource = Topic:LITERAL:t1
for request = Metadata with resourceRefCount = 1 based on rule DefaultDeny
