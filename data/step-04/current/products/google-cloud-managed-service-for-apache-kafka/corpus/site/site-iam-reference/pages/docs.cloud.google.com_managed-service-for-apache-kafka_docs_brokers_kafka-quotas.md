Use Kafka quotas for load isolation
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to control the broker resources in a
Managed Service for Apache Kafka cluster by using quotas.
Overview
Kafka lets you set quotas to limit bandwidth and request rates for different
clients. You can use quotas to ensure that unanticipated spikes in load on one
application don't affect other applications.
You can set the following quotas:
Network bandwidth for producers and consumers.
The percentage of I/O and network threads, as a way to limit request rates.
For more information about Kafka quotas, see
Quotas in the Kafka
documentation. Kafka quotas are distinct from the
Google Cloud quotas that
apply to Managed Service for Apache Kafka.
Set quotas
You can set quotas on
authenticated principals
and client-id groups. This page shows how to set quotas on a principal, but
the same steps apply to client-id groups.
Prerequisites
Before you start, install the Kafka command-line tools on a Compute Engine VM.
The VM must be able to reach a subnet that is connected to your cluster. To
create the VM and install the Kafka tools, follow the instructions in
Produce and consume messages with the Kafka command-line tools .
Set the network bandwidth quota
To set the network bandwidth quota, run the kafka-configs.sh --alter command
as follows:
kafka-configs.sh --alter \
--entity-type users \
--entity-name KAFKA_USER \
--add-config 'producer_byte_rate= PRODUCER_LIMIT ,consumer_byte_rate= CONSUMER_LIMIT ' \
--bootstrap-server = BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS \
--command-config client.properties
Replace the following.
KAFKA_USER : The principal to apply the quota to.
PRODUCER_LIMIT : The maximum producer byte rate, in
bytes per second.
CONSUMER_LIMIT : The maximum consumer byte rate, in
bytes per second.
BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS : The cluster's
bootstrap address .
Set the request rate quota
To set the request rate quota, run the kafka-configs.sh --alter command as
follows:
kafka-configs.sh --alter \
--entity-type users \
--entity-name KAFKA_USER \
--add-config 'request_percentage= REQUEST_RATE_LIMIT ' \
--bootstrap-server = BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS \
--command-config client.properties
Replace the following.
KAFKA_USER : The principal to apply the quota to.
REQUEST_RATE_LIMIT : The percentage of IO and network
thread time allowed, from a total of
(num.io.threads + num.network.threads) * 100% . The value can exceed 100.
BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS : The cluster's
bootstrap address .
View quotas
To view the quotas that have been set for all principals, run the
kafka-configs.sh --describe command as follows:
kafka-configs.sh --describe --all \
--entity-type users \
--bootstrap-server = BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS \
--command-config client.properties
Replace BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS with the cluster's
bootstrap address .
Remove quotas
To remove a quota for a principal, run the kafka-configs.sh --alter command as
follows:
kafka-configs.sh --alter \
--entity-type users \
--entity-name KAFKA_USER \
--delete-config 'producer_byte_rate,consumer_byte_rate,request_percentage' \
--bootstrap-server = BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS \
--command-config client.properties
Replace the following.
KAFKA_USER : The principal to remove the quota from.
BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS : The cluster's
bootstrap address .
Example: Limit producer bandwidth
This section shows how to limit producer bandwidth, by setting the network
bandwidth quota for the
Compute Engine default service account .
This service account is attached by default to all Compute Engine VMs
that you create.
Tip: To find the current
Application Default Credentials (ADC)
in use, run the gcloud auth list command.
Define the following shell variables:
export BOOTSTRAP = BOOTSTRAP_ADDRESS
export TOPIC = TOPIC_NAME
export KAFKA_USER = PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
To find the baseline throughput, use the kafka-producer-perf-test.sh
command to run a performance test.
kafka-producer-perf-test.sh \
--topic test-topic \
--num-records 1000000 --throughput 1000 --record-size 1024 \
--print-metrics \
--producer-props bootstrap.servers = $BOOTSTRAP \
--producer.config client.properties
This command sends 1000000 records to the specified Kafka topic. The
--throughput flag throttles the throughput to 1000 messages per second, and
--record-size sets the message size to 1024 bytes. Therefore, the load for
this test is (1000 * 1024) bytes per second, or about 1 MBps.
The output shows performance metrics for the test, similar to the following:
5005 records sent, 1000.6 records/sec (0.98 MB/sec), 3.7 ms avg latency, 41.0 ms max latency.
5002 records sent, 1000.2 records/sec (0.98 MB/sec), 3.3 ms avg latency, 23.0 ms max latency.
In this example, the throughput is approximately equal to the requested rate
of 1 MBps.
Suppose that you want to limit producers to 100 kBps. Set the producer
throughput quota as follows:
kafka-configs.sh --alter \
--entity-type users \
--entity-name $KAFKA_USER \
--add-config 'producer_byte_rate=100000' \
--bootstrap-server = $BOOTSTRAP \
--command-config client.properties
Repeat the performance test. The output shows lower throughput:
118 records sent, 204.6 records/sec (0.20 MB/sec), 220.7 ms avg latency, 4348.0 ms max latency.
60 records sent, 10.7 records/sec (0.01 MB/sec), 6145.2 ms avg latency, 9912.0 ms max latency.
1020 records sent, 181.5 records/sec (0.18 MB/sec), 11693.7 ms avg latency, 14513.0 ms max latency.
75 records sent, 13.0 records/sec (0.01 MB/sec), 16864.1 ms avg latency, 20219.0 ms max latency.
1005 records sent, 183.9 records/sec (0.18 MB/sec), 22088.6 ms avg latency, 24679.0 ms max latency.
75 records sent, 13.0 records/sec (0.01 MB/sec), 27030.4 ms avg latency, 30387.0 ms max latency.
In this example, the throughput varies from second to second, but in any
2-second window, throughput is consistent with the quota. Latency also
increases, because the test is generating data faster than it can send it,
due to the quota limit.
