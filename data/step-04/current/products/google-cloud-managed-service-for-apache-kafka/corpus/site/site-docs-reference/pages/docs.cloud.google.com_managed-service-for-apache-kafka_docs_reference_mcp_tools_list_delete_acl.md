Tool: delete_acl
Deletes a Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka ACL. Please provide the Project ID, Location, Cluster ID, and ACL ID.
A DeleteAclRequest is used to delete an ACL.
name (required): The name of the ACL to delete. Structured like projects/{project}/locations/{location}/clusters/{cluster}/acls/{acl_id} . The structure of acl_id defines the Resource Pattern (resource_type, resource_name, pattern_type) of the acl. acl_id is structured like one of the following:
For ACLs on the cluster: cluster
For ACLs on a single resource within the cluster: topic/{resource_name} , consumerGroup/{resource_name} , or transactionalId/{resource_name}
For ACLs on all resources that match a prefix: topicPrefixed/{resource_name} , consumerGroupPrefixed/{resource_name} , or transactionalIdPrefixed/{resource_name}
For ACLs on all resources of a given type (i.e. the wildcard literal "*"): allTopics (represents topic/* ), allConsumerGroups (represents consumerGroup/* ), or allTransactionalIds (represents transactionalId/* )
The following sample demonstrate how to use curl to invoke the delete_acl MCP tool.

A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance:
service Foo {
rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
}
