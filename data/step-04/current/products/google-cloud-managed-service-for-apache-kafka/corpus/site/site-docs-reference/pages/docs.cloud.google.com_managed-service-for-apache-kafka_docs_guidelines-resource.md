Guidelines to name a Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka resource
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A Google Cloud resource is any component that you create or use within
the Google Cloud. These resources form the building blocks of your
applications and systems running on the platform.
Resources in Managed Service for Apache Kafka include the following:
Cluster
Topic
Consumer group
ACL
Schema registry
Context (within a schema registry)
Subject (within a schema registry or context)
Version (versions of a schema under a subject)
Schema (identified by ID, associated with a single or multiple subjects and versions)
For more information on general Google Cloud resource naming,
see Resource names . The schema registry API for
Managed Service for Apache Kafka was designed for compatibility with an existing
open source API, so some naming conventions might differ from
typical API standards.
Resource naming format
Here are the formats for the different resources:
Cluster: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /clusters/ {CLUSTER_ID}
Topic: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /clusters/ {CLUSTER_ID} /topics/ {TOPIC_ID}
Consumer group: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /clusters/ {CLUSTER_ID} /consumerGroup/ {CONSUMER_GROUP_ID}
ACL: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /clusters/ {CLUSTER_ID} /acl/ {ACL_ID}
Schema registry: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /schemaRegistries/ {SCHEMA_REGISTRY_ID}
Context: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /schemaRegistries/ {SCHEMA_REGISTRY_ID} /contexts/ {CONTEXT_ID}
Subject:
Within default context: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /schemaRegistries/ {SCHEMA_REGISTRY_ID} /subjects/ {SUBJECT_ID}
Within a specific context: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /schemaRegistries/ {SCHEMA_REGISTRY_ID} /contexts/ {CONTEXT_ID} /subjects/ {SUBJECT_ID}
Schema (identified by ID):
Within default context: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /schemaRegistries/ {SCHEMA_REGISTRY_ID} /schemas/ids/ {SCHEMA_ID}
Within a specific context: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /schemaRegistries/ {SCHEMA_REGISTRY_ID} /contexts/ {CONTEXT_ID} /schemas/ids/ {SCHEMA_ID}
Version (identified by version number under a subject):
Within default context: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /schemaRegistries/ {SCHEMA_REGISTRY_ID} /subjects/ {SUBJECT_ID} /versions/ {VERSION_ID}
Within a specific context: projects/ {PROJECT_ID} /locations/ {LOCATION_NAME} /schemaRegistries/ {SCHEMA_REGISTRY_ID} /contexts/ {CONTEXT_ID} /subjects/ {SUBJECT_ID} /versions/ {VERSION_ID}
Here's a breakdown of each component in the next sections.
Project ID
The value must be the project ID or project number, available from
the Google Cloud console. For example, my-cool-project is a project ID,
while 123456789123 is a project number.
Location
The value must be one of the supported Managed Service for Apache Kafka locations.
For a list of available locations, see
Managed Service for Apache Kafka locations .
ID
ID is the final segment in the resource path. Variables such as
{CLUSTER_ID} , {TOPIC_ID} , {CONSUMER_GROUP_ID} ,
{SCHEMA_REGISTRY_ID} , {CONTEXT_ID} , and
{SUBJECT_ID} must conform to the following guidelines:
Not begin with the string goog
Start with a letter
Length constraints:
Cluster IDs: contain between 3 and 255 characters.
Topic, Consumer Group IDs: Any length allowed by Apache Kafka.
Apache Kafka topic names are limited to 249 characters.
Schema registry ID: contains up to 255 characters.
Context ID: contains up to 255 characters.
Subject ID: contains up to 255 UTF-8 bytes.
Character constraints:
Cluster IDs: Must match the regex ^[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? . This
means lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. It must start with a
letter and cannot end with a hyphen.
Topic, Consumer Group IDs: Validation is performed by Kafka.
The allowed characters are `[a-zA-Z0-9. -], which includes ASCII
alphanumerics, periods (.), underscores ( ), and dashes (-).
Schema registry ID: letters (uppercase or lowercase), numbers, and
underscores _ .
Context ID: letters (uppercase or lowercase), numbers, and the following
special characters: dashes - , periods . , underscores _ , tildes ~ ,
percents % , or plus signs + .
Subject ID: letters (uppercase or lowercase), numbers, and the following
special characters: dashes - , periods . , underscores _ , tildes ~ ,
percents % , or plus signs + .
ACL ID
The acl_id defines the resource pattern to which the ACL entries apply. All ACL entries in the ACL apply to the resource pattern encoded in the ACL ID.
acl_id must be structured like one of the following:
For ACLs on the cluster:
cluster
For ACLs on a single resource within the cluster:
topic/ {RESOURCE_NAME}
consumerGroup/ {RESOURCE_NAME}
transactionalId/ {RESOURCE_NAME}
For ACLs on all resources that match a prefix:
topicPrefixed/ {RESOURCE_NAME}
consumerGroupPrefixed/ {RESOURCE_NAME}
transactionalIdPrefixed/ {RESOURCE_NAME}
For ACLs on all resources of a given type (wildcard):
allTopics (represents topic/* )
allConsumerGroups (represents consumerGroup/* )
allTransactionalIds (represents transactionalId/* )
{RESOURCE_NAME} : The name of the specific resource.
Examples:
To grant permissions on a specific topic my-topic : topic/my-topic
To grant permissions on all topics starting with test- : topicPrefixed/test-
To grant permissions on the cluster itself: cluster
To grant permissions on any group: allConsumerGroups
To grant permissions on a specific transactional ID tx-id : transactionalId/tx-id
Special characters
You can use the special characters listed in the previous section in resource
IDs without URL-encoding. However, you must ensure that any other special
character is properly encoded or decoded when used in URLs.
For example, mi-tópico is an invalid ID if ó is not an allowed character
for that specific resource ID type. However, mi-topico would be valid if
only basic Latin letters are allowed. This format is important when
making REST calls.
If you're referencing a topic from the Kafka client libraries, the
full resource
path is not used. Only the topic name itself is used. Similarly, when
interacting with schemas using Kafka client integrations like serializers or
deserializers, you typically use the subject name rather than the full resource path.
Subject naming strategies
When working with schema registry, especially with Kafka client integrations
like serializers and deserializers, the subject name is crucial. The subject
naming strategy determines how a schema is registered and retrieved from the
schema registry. Different strategies offer varying levels of flexibility and
control over schema evolution.
You can configure the subject naming strategy by setting the
key.subject.name.strategy or value.subject.name.strategy property in your
Kafka client configuration.
TopicNameStrategy
This is the default strategy for open-source Kafka client libraries.
The subject name is derived directly from the Kafka topic name, appended with
key for message keys or value for message values. If auto.register.schema
is set to true , producer clients use topicName-value or topicName-key
for a topic named topicName .
Here are some examples:
Topic name: orders
Subject for message values: orders-value
Subject for message keys: orders-key
The following is a list of advantages for using TopicNameStrategy :
It's a straightforward strategy, making it a good fit for many use cases.
Schemas are tied directly to a topic, allowing you to evolve the record
types within a single topic independently.
The following is a list of disadvantages for using TopicNameStrategy :
Each topic can effectively only handle one type of message that is based
on the value schema. This is because the subject name is fixed to the topic
name. If you need to send different types of records to the same topic,
this strategy won't work.
RecordNameStrategy
This strategy uses the fully qualified class name of the Avro or Protobuf
record as the subject name.
Here are some examples:
Avro schema name: com.example.data.Customer
Protobuf message name: com.example.data.Order
Subject for customer schema: com.example.data.Customer
Subject for order schema: com.example.data.Order
The following is a list of advantages for using RecordNameStrategy :
Since the subject name isn't tied to the topic, you can send different
types of records to the same Kafka topic. This is possible as long as
each record type has its own unique fully qualified name and corresponding
schema registered.
A schema for a specific record type such as com.example.common.Address
can be used across multiple topics, and its evolution is managed centrally
under a single subject.
The following is a list of disadvantages for using RecordNameStrategy :
You must use the same subject and version for all topics that use a
particular record type. This can be restrictive if you need different
versions of the same record type in different topics.
TopicRecordNameStrategy
This strategy combines aspects of both TopicNameStrategy and RecordNameStrategy .
The subject name is a combination of the Kafka topic name and the fully
qualified class name of the record, formatted as
TOPIC_NAME-FULLY_QUALIFIED_CLASS_NAME .
Here are some examples:
Topic: user-events
Fully qualified name: com.example.events.PageView
Subject name for this combination: user-events-com.example.events.PageView
Another topic: product-interactions
Fully qualified name: com.example.events.PageView
Subject name for this combination: product-interactions-com.example.events.PageView
Note: com.example.events.PageView can evolve differently in user-events
than in product-interactions .
The following is a list of advantages for using TopicRecordNameStrategy :
Similar to RecordNameStrategy , you can send different types of records to
the same topic.
Unlike RecordNameStrategy , this strategy lets you evolve the schema for a
specific record type independently within each topic. This means
my-topic-com.example.project.MyRecord can evolve differently than
another-topic-com.example.project.MyRecord .
The following is a list of disadvantages for using TopicRecordNameStrategy :
Subject names can become quite long due to the combination of topic
name and fully qualified record name.
