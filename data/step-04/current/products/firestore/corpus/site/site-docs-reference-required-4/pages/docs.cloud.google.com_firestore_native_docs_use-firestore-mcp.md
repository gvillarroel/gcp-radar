This document describes how to use the Firestore
remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to connect to
Firestore from AI applications such as
Gemini CLI, Claude, or in AI
applications that you're developing.
The Firestore remote MCP server lets you interact with documents stored in a Firestore database from you AI application.
.
Model Context Protocol
(MCP) standardizes how large language models (LLMs) and AI applications or
agents connect to external data sources. MCP servers let you use their tools,
resources, and prompts to take actions and get updated data from their backend
service.
What's the difference between local and remote MCP servers?
Local MCP servers
Typically run on your local machine and use the standard input
and output streams (stdio) for communication between services on the same
device.
Remote MCP servers
Run on the service's infrastructure and offer an HTTP
endpoint to AI applications for communication between the AI MCP client and
the MCP server. For more information about MCP architecture, see
MCP architecture .

Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to use the Firestore MCP server and interact with Firestore documents,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on the project where you want to use the Firestore MCP server:
Make MCP tool calls:
MCP Tool User ( roles/mcp.toolUser )
Read and edit Firestore documents:
Firestore User ( roles/datastore.user )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to use the Firestore MCP server and interact with Firestore documents. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to use the Firestore MCP server and interact with Firestore documents:
Make MCP tool calls:
mcp.tools.call
Read and edit Firestore documents:
datastore.entities.allocateIds
datastore.entities.create
datastore.entities.delete
datastore.entities.get
datastore.entities.list
datastore.entities.update
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Authentication and authorization
Firestore MCP servers use the
OAuth 2.0
protocol with
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
for authentication and authorization. All
Google Cloud identities
are supported for authentication to MCP servers.
We recommend creating a separate identity for agents using MCP tools so that
access to resources can be controlled and monitored. For more information on
authentication, see Authenticate to MCP servers .
Firestore MCP OAuth scopes
OAuth 2.0 uses scopes and credentials to determine if an authenticated
principal is authorized to take a specific action on a resource. For more
information about OAuth 2.0 scopes at Google, read
Using OAuth 2.0 to access Google APIs .
Firestore has the following MCP tool OAuth scopes:
Scope URI for gcloud CLI
Description
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
See, edit, configure, and delete your Google Cloud data and see the email address for your Google Account.
Additional scopes might be required on the resources accessed during a tool
call. To view a list of scopes required for
Firestore, see
Firestore API .
Configure an MCP client to use the Firestore MCP server
AI applications and agents, such as Claude or Gemini
CLI, can instantiate an MCP client that connects to a single MCP server. An AI
application can have multiple clients that connect to different MCP servers. To
connect to a remote MCP server, the MCP client must know at a minimum the URL of
the remote MCP server.
In your AI application, look for a way to connect to a remote MCP server. You
are prompted to enter details about the server, such as its name and URL.
For the Firestore MCP server, enter the following as
required:
Server name : Firestore MCP server
Server URL or Endpoint : https://firestore.googleapis.com/mcp
Transport : HTTP
Authentication details : Depending on how you want to authenticate, you can
enter your Google Cloud credentials, your OAuth Client ID
and secret, or an agent identity and credentials. For more information on
authentication, see Authenticate to MCP servers .
OAuth scope : the OAuth 2.0 scope that
you want to use when connecting to the Firestore
MCP server.
For host specific guidance, see the following:
Claude.ai
Gemini CLI
For more general guidance, see the following resources:
Connect to remote MCP servers .
Configure MCP in an AI application .
Available tools
To view details of available MCP tools and their descriptions for the
Firestore MCP server, see the
Firestore MCP reference .
List tools
Use the MCP inspector to list tools, or send a
tools/list HTTP request directly to the Firestore
remote MCP server. The tools/list method doesn't require authentication.
POST /mcp HTTP/1.1
Host: firestore.googleapis.com
Content-Type: application/json
{
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"method": "tools/list",
}
Sample use cases
The following are sample use cases and prompts for the Firestore
MCP server:
"What tools are available for the Firestore MCP server?"
"Add a document with collection "book" under my Firestore database "my-database" with the Google Cloud project "my-project" with generated book info."
"Get the information for the book with ID 3VyGFIAPRHUNeuH5h2eb from the book collection."
"Update the year field of document 3VyGFIAPRHUNeuH5h2eb to 1995."
"List all books under the book collection."
"List all collections IDs under the root of the "my-database" Firestore database."
"Delete the document 3VyGFIAPRHUNeuH5h2eb under the book collection."
Optional security and safety configurations
MCP introduces new security risks and considerations due to the wide variety of
actions that can be taken with MCP tools. To minimize and manage these risks,
Google Cloud offers defaults and customizable policies to
control the use of MCP tools in your Google Cloud
organization or project.
For more information about MCP security and governance, see
AI security and safety .
Use Model Armor
Model Armor is a
Google Cloud service designed to enhance the security and
safety of your AI applications. It works by proactively screening LLM prompts
and responses, protecting against various risks and supporting responsible AI
practices. Whether you are deploying AI in your cloud environment, or on
external cloud providers, Model Armor can help
you prevent malicious input, verify content safety, protect sensitive data,
maintain compliance, and enforce your AI safety and security policies
consistently across your diverse AI landscape.
Model Armor is only available in specific regional locations. If
Model Armor is enabled for a project, and a call to that project comes
from an unsupported region, then Model Armor makes a cross-regional
call. For more information, see
Model Armor locations .
Caution: When Model Armor is enabled with
logging enabled , Model Armor logs the entire
payload. This might expose sensitive information in the logs.
Enable Model Armor
You must enable Model Armor APIs before you can use Model Armor.
Console
Enable the Model Armor API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Select the project where you want to activate Model Armor.
gcloud
Before you begin, follow these steps using the Google Cloud CLI with the
Model Armor API:
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Run the following command to set the API endpoint for the
Model Armor service.
gcloud config set api_endpoint_overrides/modelarmor "https://modelarmor. LOCATION .rep.googleapis.com/"
Replace LOCATION with the region where you want to use
Model Armor.
Configure protection for Google and Google Cloud remote MCP servers
To help protect your MCP tool calls and responses you can use
Model Armor floor settings. A floor setting defines the minimum
security filters that apply across the project. This configuration applies a
consistent set of filters to all MCP tool calls and responses within
the project.
Tip: Don't enable the prompt injection and jailbreak filter unless your MCP
traffic carries natural language data.
Set up a Model Armor floor setting with MCP sanitization
enabled. For more information, see Configure Model Armor floor
settings .
Note: If the agent and the MCP server are in different projects, you can create
floor settings in both projects (the client project and the resource project).
In this case, Model Armor is invoked twice, once for each project.
See the following example command:
gcloud model-armor floorsettings update \
--full-uri = 'projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/floorSetting' \
--enable-floor-setting-enforcement = TRUE \
--add-integrated-services = GOOGLE_MCP_SERVER \
--google-mcp-server-enforcement-type = INSPECT_AND_BLOCK \
--enable-google-mcp-server-cloud-logging \
--malicious-uri-filter-settings-enforcement = ENABLED \
--add-rai-settings-filters = '[{"confidenceLevel": "MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE", "filterType": "DANGEROUS"}]'
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project ID.
Note the following settings:
INSPECT_AND_BLOCK : The enforcement type that
inspects content for the Google MCP server and blocks prompts and
responses that match the filters.
ENABLED : The setting that enables a filter or
enforcement.
MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE : The confidence level for the
Responsible AI - Dangerous filter settings. You can modify this setting,
though lower values might result in more false positives. For more
information, see
Model Armor confidence levels .
Disable scanning MCP traffic with Model Armor
If you want to stop scanning Google MCP traffic with Model Armor,
run the following command:
gcloud model-armor floorsettings update \
--full-uri = 'projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/floorSetting' \
--remove-integrated-services = GOOGLE_MCP_SERVER
Replace PROJECT_ID with the Google Cloud project
ID.
Model Armor won't scan MCP traffic in the project.
Control MCP use with IAM deny policies
Identity and Access Management (IAM) deny policies help you
secure Google Cloud remote MCP servers. Configure these policies to block
unwanted MCP tool access.
For example, you can deny or allow access based on:
The principal
Tool properties like read-only
The application's OAuth client ID
For more information, see Control MCP use with Identity and Access Management .
Monitor MCP usage
You can monitor the usage and latency of your Firestore MCP tools through
Cloud Monitoring .
The following metrics are available for the firestore.googleapis.com/Database
monitored resource:
mcp/request_count (Beta): The count of Firestore MCP calls.
mcp/request_latencies (Beta): The distribution of latencies for Firestore MCP calls.
You can group and filter these metrics by the following labels:
tool_name : The name of the MCP tool making the MCP call.
For more information about Firestore metrics, see
Firestore metrics .
