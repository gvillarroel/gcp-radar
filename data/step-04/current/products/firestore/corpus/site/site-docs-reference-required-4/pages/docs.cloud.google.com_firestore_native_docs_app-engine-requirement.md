App Engine Requirement
Previously, all Firestore databases were linked to an App Engine app.
When linked, your database requires an active App Engine app in the same
project. Without the active App Engine app, read and write access to the
database is disabled.
Firestore databases are now provisioned unlinked from App Engine
by default.
If your database is linked to an App Engine, you can unlink your database.
Active App Engine
An active App Engine app means that an app exists in the same project and
that this app is not disabled. It does not require that app to have any usage.
The linked app and database must exist in the same region.
If you disable your App Engine app, you also disable access to the
Firestore database linked to that app.
View App Engine link status
You can check the App Engine unlink state using the REST API:
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
--header "Content-type: application/json" \
"https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /databases/(default)"
In the response, look at the value of appEngineIntegrationMode . If the value
is DISABLED , your database is not linked to an App Engine app.
Unlink your database from App Engine
If you disable a linked App Engine app, you also disable read and write access
to your database. If this happens, the Firestore Data page in
Google Cloud console presents the option to unlink your database from the
App Engine app. Click Unlink Database to begin the process.
Go to Firestore Data
You can also unlink your database using the REST API:
curl -X PATCH \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
--header "Content-type: application/json" \
--data '{"app_engine_integration_mode": "DISABLED"}' \
"https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /databases/(default)?updateMask=appEngineIntegrationMode"
When you unlink your database,
you can disable App Engine without affecting access to your database.
Unlinking is a permanent operation. It may take up to five minutes for the
unlinking operation to take effect.
Migrating Terraform App Engine Resources
If you previously managed Firestore databases via the
google_app_engine_application Terraform resource, you can use the
google_firestore_database Terraform resource instead.
For general instructions on managing Firestore databases via
Terraform, see
Automating database creation .
Create a google_firestore_database resource
In your Terraform configuration file, create a new
google_firestore_database resource:
firestore.tf
resource "google_firestore_database" "database" {
project = " project "
name = "(default)"
location_id = " location "
type = " database_type " // either "FIRESTORE_NATIVE" or "DATASTORE_MODE"
app_engine_integration_mode = "DISABLED"
// Optional, but recommended for safety
delete_protection_state = "DELETE_PROTECTION_ENABLED"
}
See
Firestore locations
for the list of available locations. Choose the location corresponding to that
of your existing database.
Import the existing Firestore database
First, ensure that the
Firestore API
is enabled.
Next, import the existing Firestore database into your Terraform
state:
terraform import google_firestore_database.database "(default)"
Next, run:
terraform plan
Inspect the output to ensure the import completed successfully. If the output
shows any fields changing, ensure these changes are intended. If the output
includes a line similar to:
google_firestore_database.database must be replaced
then inspect your Terraform configuration file to see if there were any
mistakes, particularly in the project , location , or
name fields, and then run terraform plan again. Any fields that are
requiring Terraform to replace your database will be marked with
# forces replacement in the plan output.
Warning: Do not run terraform apply if you see any database resources
requiring replacement. Doing so may cause the loss of your
Firestore data.
Once you are satisfied with the Terraform plan output, run:
terraform apply
Removing the google_app_engine_application resource
If you have an existing google_app_engine_application resource in
your Terraform configuration file, remove it from that file now.
Afterwards, once again run:
terraform plan
You should see output similar to the following:
Terraform will perform the following actions:
# google_app_engine_application.app will be destroyed
# (because google_app_engine_application.app is not in configuration)
Once you are satisfied with the plan output, run
terraform apply
Terraform does not currently support deletion of App Engine resources;
although Terraform will show the resource as being destroyed, it will not
actually delete the App Engine application. However, the App Engine
application will no longer be managed by Terraform.
Firestore API Requirement
Previously, all Firestore databases were linked to an App Engine app.
Firestore databases are now
provisioned unlinked from App Engine by default. Additionally, all databases,
both existing and newly created, now have the following requirements:
To manage your database from the Google Cloud console and the
gcloud CLI, the Firestore API must be enabled
in the project. This is required for both Firestore in
Native mode and Firestore in Datastore mode databases.
When executed from the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI,
the administrative operations below will require the following IAM permissions:
Create database: datastore.databases.create
View database metadata: datastore.databases.getMetadata
Edit database metadata: datastore.databases.update
Predefined roles such as
Datastore User and Datastore Viewer include the required permissions. If you
created any custom IAM roles, you may need to update them to include the
permissions above.
If you previously defined a custom role for Datastore,
it might lack the datastore.databases.getMetadata permission. Ensure continued
access by updating your custom roles with datastore.databases.getMetadata or
by using a predefined role .
Enabling the API via Terraform
If you wish, you can also enable the Firestore API via Terraform:
resource "google_project_service" "firestore" {
project = " project "
service = "firestore.googleapis.com"
}
If you have a google_firestore_database resource, you can add a
dependency on the google_project_service resource to ensure that
the API is enabled before Terraform attempts to create the database:
resource "google_firestore_database" "database" {
// ...
depends_on = [google_project_service.firestore]
}
