Monitor performance with client-side traces
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
To monitor and debug Firestore requests end-to-end, you can
enable traces in the client libraries. Client-side tracing can provide a
signal about the performance as experienced by your application, as well as
insights that can help with debugging issues.
Client-side traces, which are collected by executing RPCs from the client,
provide the following information:
Spans with timestamps of when the client sent the RPC request and
when the client received the RPC response, including latency introduced by the
network and client system
Attributes (key-value pairs) that surface information about the client and
its configuration
Logs associated with key events in the spans
Stack traces if a crash occurs in the client
OpenTelemetry
Traces for the client libraries are instrumented using
OpenTelemetry APIs.
OpenTelemetry is an industry standard, open-source observability framework.
OpenTelemetry offers a wide range of tools such as instrumentation APIs and
SDKs, collectors, backend-specific exporters and flexible configuration options
such as sampling controls and span limits.
Export traces with exporters and collectors
As part of your configurations, you can export your traces to
an observability backend. Most observability service providers offer
exporters for you to use, such as
Cloud Trace .
In addition to an exporter, OpenTelemetry recommends setting up a
Collector . A Collector lets your
service offload data quickly and lets the collector take care of additional
handling like retries, batching, and encryption. A Collector runs alongside
your application. The collector receives OTLP messages, processes the messages,
and exports them to your observability backend.
Limitations
Client-side traces have the following limitations:
Trace spans are available for the Java and Node.js client libraries.
The client library does not produce trace spans for real-time listeners .
Billing
In addition to Firestore usage, client-side tracing can incur
charges.
There are no charges for collecting traces or usage of the OpenTelemetry
framework.
Ingestion of trace spans into your observability backend may be billable.
For example, if you use Cloud Trace as your backend, you are
billed according to Cloud Trace pricing .
If you use another observability service provider, find out their billing model
and associated costs.
To better understand billing, start with
a small trace sampling ratio (trace a small percentage of your RPCs) based
on your traffic.
Before you begin
Before you begin:
Make sure you set up the service account under which your app writes traces
to your observability backend with the necessary
Identity and Access Management roles :
Trace operation
IAM role
Read traces
roles/cloudtrace.user
Write traces
roles/cloudtrace.agent
Read/write traces
roles/cloudtrace.admin
Verify Trace API is enabled on this project.
Configure client-side traces
This section provides example configurations for client-side traces.
You can export to a Collector or directly to an observability backend.
You also have the following options for configuring client-side traces:
You can configure traces with the OpenTelemetry APIs. This requires code
changes to your application. See the following examples:
Export to a Collector with OpenTelemetry APIs
Export directly to an observability backend with OpenTelemetry APIs
You can configure traces without code changes by following the examples
in Zero-code instrumentation .
Export traces to a Collector with OpenTelemetry APIs
The following code configures the client library
to export spans with a 10% sampling ratio to an OpenTelemetry Collector.

OtlpGrpcSpanExporter otlpGrpcSpanExporter =
OtlpGrpcSpanExporter
. builder ()
. setEndpoint ( "http://localhost:4317" ) // Replace with your OTLP endpoint
. build ();
// Using a batch span processor
// You can also use other `BatchSpanProcessorBuilder` methods
// to further customize.
BatchSpanProcessor otlpGrpcSpanProcessor =
BatchSpanProcessor . builder ( otlpGrpcSpanExporter ). build ();
// Export to a collector that is expecting OTLP using gRPC.

Export directly to an observability backend with OpenTelemetry APIs
If your observability service provider supports OTLP ingestion, you can use
their OpenTelemetry exporter to export traces directly to their backend. The
following code configures the client library to directly export trace spans to
Cloud Trace with a 10% trace sampling ratio.
Java (Admin)
// TraceExporter needed for this use case
import com.google.cloud.opentelemetry.trace.TraceExporter ;
Resource resource = Resource
. getDefault (). merge ( Resource . builder (). put ( SERVICE_NAME , "My App" ). build ());
SpanExporter gcpTraceExporter = TraceExporter . createWithDefaultConfiguration ();
// Using a batch span processor
// You can also use other `BatchSpanProcessorBuilder` methods
// to further customize.
SpanProcessor gcpBatchSpanProcessor =
BatchSpanProcessor . builder ( gcpTraceExporter ). build ();
// Export directly to Cloud Trace with 10% trace sampling ratio
OpenTelemetrySdk otel = OpenTelemetrySdk . builder ()
. setTracerProvider ( SdkTracerProvider . builder ()
. setResource ( resource )
. addSpanProcessor ( gcpBatchSpanProcessor )
. setSampler ( Sampler . traceIdRatioBased ( 0.1 ))
. build ())
. build ();
Firestore firestore = FirestoreOptions
. newBuilder ()
. setOpenTelemetryOptions (
FirestoreOpenTelemetryOptions . newBuilder ()
. setTracingEnabled ( true )
. setOpenTelemetry ( otel )
. build ())
. build (). getService ();
Node.js (Admin)
import { trace } from "@opentelemetry/api" ;
import { GrpcInstrumentation } from '@opentelemetry/instrumentation-grpc' ;
import { TraceExporter } from "@google-cloud/opentelemetry-cloud-trace-exporter" ;
import pkg1 from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node" ;
import pkg2 from "@opentelemetry/instrumentation" ;
const { NodeTracerProvider , BatchSpanProcessor , TraceIdRatioBasedSampler } = pkg1 ;
const { registerInstrumentations } = pkg2 ;
const provider = new NodeTracerProvider (
// Provide your chosen NodeTracerConfig such as sampler and span limits
{
sampler : new TraceIdRatioBasedSampler ( 0.1 ),
}
);
provider . addSpanProcessor ( new BatchSpanProcessor ( new TraceExporter ()));
provider . register ();
// If you'd like to see gRPC spans (recommended), enable GrpcInstrumentation
registerInstrumentations ({

],
});
const settings : Settings = {

}
};

Zero-code instrumentation
Complete the following instructions to configure traces without code changes:
Java (Admin)
You can configure traces without code changes using auto agents. You need to
set the environment variable FIRESTORE_ENABLE_TRACING=ON . You also
need to set other configuration settings
as described in
Agent Configuration .
See the following examples.
Export to a Collector with Auto Agents
Run your OpenTelemetry Collector with OTLP gRPC receivers enabled. Set the
agent's exporter to otlp and specify the endpoint where the agent should
export the data. The following example uses a 10% sampling ratio and sends
traces to the Collector that listens on localhost port 4317 .
FIRESTORE_ENABLE_TRACING = ON \
java \
- javaagent : path / to / opentelemetry - javaagent . jar \
- Dotel . traces . exporter = otlp \
- Dotel . exporter . otlp . endpoint = "http://localhost:4317" \
- Dotel . traces . sampler = traceidratio \
- Dotel . traces . sampler . arg = 0.1 \
- Dotel . service . name = "My App" \
- jar myapp . jar
Export directly to an observability backend with Auto Agents
In addition to setting the environment variable FIRESTORE_ENABLE_TRACING=ON ,
you need to add the OpenTelemetry Java agent extension for your specific
backend. The following example uses the Trace exporter extension
and a 10% trace sampling ratio.
FIRESTORE_ENABLE_TRACING = ON \
java \
- javaagent : path / to / opentelemetry - javaagent . jar \
- Dotel . javaagent . extensions =/ path / to / exporter - auto - 0.26 . 0 - alpha - shaded . jar \
- Dotel . traces . exporter = google_cloud_trace \
- Dotel . traces . sampler = traceidratio \
- Dotel . traces . sampler . arg = 0.1 \
Node.js (Admin)
To set up zero-code instrumentation,
follow the OpenTelemetry instructions for JavaScript instrumentation .
The following example code snippet enables
instrumentation and sends traces to an OpenTelemetry collector:
npm install @ opentelemetry / api
npm install @ opentelemetry / auto - instrumentations - node
env \
FIRESTORE_ENABLE_TRACING = ON \
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER = otlp \
OTEL_NODE_ENABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS = "http,grpc" \
OTEL_NODE_RESOURCE_DETECTORS = "none" \
node -- require @ opentelemetry / auto - instrumentations - node / register my_app . js
