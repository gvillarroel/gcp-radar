Optimize query performance
Preview
— Firestore in Native mode (with Pipeline Operations) for Enterprise Edition
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
You can process personal data for
this feature
as outlined in the
Cloud Data
Processing Addendum , subject to the obligations and restrictions described in the
agreement under which you access Google Cloud.
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
To troubleshoot slow queries, use
Query Explain
to obtain the query execution
plan and the runtime execution profile. The following section describe
steps you can take to optimize query performance depending on the execution profile:
Limit the number of results
Use the records returned field in the execution tree to
identify if the query is returning many documents. Consider limiting the number
of documents returned by using the
limit(...) stage. This reduces the serialized byte size of the results when returned to
the clients over the network. In cases
where the Limit node is preceded by a MajorSort node, the query engine can
coalesce the Limit and the MajorSort nodes and replaces a full in-memory
materialization and sort with a TopN sort, reducing the memory requirement for
the query.
Limit the Result Document Size
Consider limiting the size of the
document returned by using by using a select(...) to only return the fields
required or remove_fields(...) to discard overly
large fields. This helps reduce the compute and memory cost of processing
intermediate results and the serialized byte size of the results when returned
to the clients over the network. In cases where all fields referenced in the
query are covered by a regular index, this also allows the query to be
fully covered by the index scan, avoiding the need to fetch documents from the
primary storage.
Use indexes
Use the following instructions to set up and optimize indexes.
Identify if the query is using an index
You can identify if the query is using an index by checking the leaf nodes in the
execution tree. If the leaf node of the execution tree is a
TableScan node ,
that means the query is not using an index and is scanning documents from primary
storage. If an index is being used, the leaf node of the execution tree will
display the index ID and index fields of the index.
Identify a better index
An index is useful for a query if it can reduce the number of
documents that the query engine needs to fetch from primary storage or if its
field ordering can deliver the Sort requirement of the query.
If an index is used for a query, but the query engine is still fetching and
discarding many documents, as identified by a Scan node that returns many
records followed by a
Filter node
that returns few records, this is a sign that
the query predicate satisfied using the index is not selective. To create a more
suitable index, see Create indexes .
If an index is used for a query, but the query engine is still
performing an in-memory reordering of the result set, as identified by a
MajorSort node
in the query execution tree, this is a sign that the index used
can't be used to deliver the Sort requirement of the query. To create a more
suitable index, see the next section.
Create Indexes
Follow the index management documentation to
create indexes .
To ensure your query can use indexes, create regular (not Multikey) indexes
with fields in the following order:
All fields that will be used in equality operators.
To maximize chance of reuse
across queries, order fields in decreasing order of occurrence of the fields in
equality operators among queries.
All fields that will be sorted on (in the same
order).
Fields that will be used in range or inequality operators in decreasing
order of query constraint selectivity.
Fields that will be returned as part of a
query in the index: including such fields in the index allows the index to cover
the query and avoid having to fetch document from the primary storage.
Force an index or table scan
When you query Firestore in Native Mode, it automatically uses any indexes that are
likely to make the query more efficient. As a result, you don't need to
specify an index for your queries. However, for queries that are critical
for your workload, we recommend that you use the forceIndex option for
more consistent performance.
In a few cases, Firestore in Native Mode might choose an index that causes query latency
to increase. If you've followed the troubleshooting steps for performance
regressions and confirmed that it makes sense to try a different index for
the query, you can specify the index using the forceIndex option.
You can use the forceIndex option on any input stage in
Pipeline operations to override Firestore in Native Mode's default query
plan and specify an index to use, or to force a table scan.
Force a specific index
To force the query to use a specific index, provide the index ID as a string
to the forceIndex option. You can find the index ID from the console or
from error messages.
The following example forces the planner to use index with ID CICAgOi36pgK :
// Force Planner to use Index ID CICAgOi36pgK
db . pipeline ()
. collectionGroup ({ collectionId : "customers" , forceIndex : "CICAgOi36pgK" })
. limit ( 100 )
Here are some use cases for forcing a specific index:
Testing the performance of different indexes.
Ensuring a specific, known-optimal index is used for a query.
Overriding the optimizer when its default choice is suboptimal for a
particular query.
If the specified index is not found, the query fails.
Force a table scan
A table scan reads documents in the collection or collection group without
using any secondary indexes. To force a table scan, set forceIndex to primary .
The following example forces a table scan:
// Force Planner to only do a Full-Table Scan
db . pipeline ()
. collectionGroup ({ collectionId : "customers" , forceIndex : "primary" })
. limit ( 100 )
You might use a table scan in the following cases:
For very small collections where index overhead is not justified.
For queries that access most of the documents in a collection.
For debugging and performance comparisons.
Caution: Table scans on large collections are slow and don't scale.
They read all documents in the collection, which significantly
increases read operation costs. For most production scenarios, we recommend
relying on indexes instead of forcing table scans.
Use forceIndex with Query Explain
You can use Query Explain , especially
with the analyze option, to observe the effects of forceIndex :
Verify that Firestore in Native Mode used the specified index in forceIndex by
checking the leaf nodes of the execution tree for the index ID.
Confirm that a TableScan node appears in the plan when using
forceIndex: "primary" .
Compare the performance metrics—such as latency, documents scanned, and index
entries scanned—with and without forceIndex to fine-tune query performance.
Best practices for forceIndex
While forceIndex provides more control over query execution,
Firestore in Native Mode's query optimizer is generally efficient for most use cases.
Consider the following best practices when using forceIndex :
Use forceIndex judiciously. If you observe suboptimal performance with
the default query plan, use
Query Explain to diagnose the issue
before forcing an index.
When using forceIndex , make sure to test your queries with realistic data
volumes to understand their performance and cost characteristics.
Avoid using forceIndex: "primary" on large collections in production
environments.
