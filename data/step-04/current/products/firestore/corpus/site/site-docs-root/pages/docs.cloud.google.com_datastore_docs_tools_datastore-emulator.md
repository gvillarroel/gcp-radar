Running the Datastore Emulator
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: This content applies to the emulator for legacy Cloud Datastore.
To emulate Firestore in Datastore mode,
use gcloud emulators firestore start --database-mode=datastore-mode instead.
The Datastore emulator provides local emulation of the production
Datastore environment.
You can use the emulator to develop and
test your application locally. In addition, the emulator can help you
generate indexes for your production Datastore instance and
delete unneeded indexes. This page guides you through installing the emulator,
starting the emulator, and setting environment variables to connect your
application to the emulator.
Note: To access the emulator from App Engine, see Using the Local Development Server .
Known issues
By default, the Datastore emulator does not emulate
features introduced by Firestore in Datastore mode .
The following default emulator behaviors do not match Datastore mode:
The emulator simulates eventual consistency, by default. Firestore in Datastore mode
is strongly consistent.
The emulator does not allow non-ancestor queries within transactions.
Firestore in Datastore mode no longer has this limitation.
The emulator does not support IN , != , and NOT-IN queries.
The emulator does not support aggregation queries like COUNT(*) .
However, the --use-firestore-in-datastore-mode
flag helps loosen some of the restrictions above for Firestore in Datastore Mode.
The emulator simulates strongly consistent non-ancestor queries.
The emulator allows for non-ancestor queries within transactions.
The emulator removes the limitation of 25 entity groups in a transaction.
To emulate Firestore in Datastore mode,
use gcloud emulators firestore start --database-mode=datastore-mode
instead.
Before you begin
To use the Datastore emulator you need:
A Java JRE (version 21 or greater)
The Google Cloud CLI
An application built using the Google Cloud Client Libraries
Installing the emulator
The Datastore emulator is a component of the gcloud CLI.
Use the gcloud components install command to install the
Datastore emulator:
gcloud components install cloud-datastore-emulator
Emulator data directories
The emulator simulates Datastore by creating
/WEB-INF/appengine-generated/local_db.bin in a specified data directory and
storing data in local_db.bin . By default, the emulator uses the
data directory ~/.config/gcloud/emulators/datastore/ .
The local_db.bin file persists between sessions of the emulator. You can set
up multiple data directories and think of each as a separate, local
Datastore mode instance. To clear the contents of a local_db.bin
file, stop the emulator and manually delete the file.
Starting the emulator
Start the emulator by executing datastore start from a command prompt:
gcloud beta emulators datastore start [ flags ]
where [flags] are optional command-line arguments supplied to the
gcloud CLI. For example:
--data-dir=[DATA_DIR] changes the emulator's data
directory. The emulator creates the
/WEB-INF/appengine-generated/local_db.bin file inside [DATA_DIR]
or, if available, uses an existing file.
--no-store-on-disk configures the emulator not to persist any
data to disk for the emulator session.
See the gcloud beta emulators datastore start reference for the full
list of optional flags.
After you start the emulator, you should see a message similar
to the following:
...
[ datastore ] Dev App Server is now running .
To stop the emulator, type Control-C at the command prompt.
Setting environment variables
After you start the emulator, you need to set environment variables so that your
application connects to the emulator instead of your production
Datastore mode database. Set these environment variables on the
same machine that you use to run your application.
You need to set the environment variables each time you start the emulator.
The environment variables depend on dynamically assigned port numbers that
could change when you restart the emulator.
Note: If you use the .NET client library, use this method to read the
environment variables and connect to the emulator .
Automatically setting the variables
If your application and the emulator run on the same machine, you can set the
environment variables automatically:
Linux / macOS
Run env-init using command substitution:
$(gcloud beta emulators datastore env-init)
Windows
Create and run a batch file using output from env-init :
gcloud beta emulators datastore env - init > set_vars . cmd && set_vars . cmd
Your application will now connect to the Datastore emulator.
Manually setting the variables
If your application and the emulator run on different machines, set the
environment variables manually:
Run the env-init command:
gcloud beta emulators datastore env-init
On the machine that runs your application, set the environment
variables and values as directed by the output
of the env-init command. For example:
Linux / macOS
export DATASTORE_DATASET = my-project-id
export DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST = ::1:8432
export DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST_PATH = ::1:8432/datastore
export DATASTORE_HOST = http://::1:8432
export DATASTORE_PROJECT_ID = my-project-id
Windows
set DATASTORE_DATASET = my-project-id
set DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST = ::1:8432
set DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST_PATH = ::1:8432/datastore
set DATASTORE_HOST = http://::1:8432
set DATASTORE_PROJECT_ID = my-project-id
Your application will now connect to the Datastore emulator. Note
that the project id and port provided by the command will differ from the above
example.
Updating and deleting indexes
By running your application using the emulator, you can generate indexes for
your production Datastore mode database, as well as delete unneeded
indexes. Learn more at Using the gcloud CLI .
Removing environment variables
After you finish using the emulator, stop the emulator (Control-C) and remove
the environment variables so your application will connect to your production
Datastore mode database.
Automatically removing the variables
If your application and the emulator run on the same machine, you can remove the
environment variables automatically:
Linux / macOS
Run env-unset using command substitution:
$(gcloud beta emulators datastore env-unset)
Windows
Create and run a batch file using output from env-unset :
gcloud beta emulators datastore env - unset > remove_vars . cmd && remove_vars . cmd
Your application will now connect to your production Datastore mode
database.
Manually removing the variables
If your application and the emulator run on different machines,
remove the environment variables manually:
Run the env-unset command:
gcloud beta emulators datastore env-unset
On the machine that runs your application, remove the environment
variables as directed by the output of the env-unset command.
For example:
Linux / macOS
unset DATASTORE_DATASET
unset DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST
unset DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST_PATH
unset DATASTORE_HOST
unset DATASTORE_PROJECT_ID
Windows
set DATASTORE_DATASET =
set DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST =
set DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST_PATH =
set DATASTORE_HOST =
set DATASTORE_PROJECT_ID =
Your application will now connect to your production Datastore mode
database.
