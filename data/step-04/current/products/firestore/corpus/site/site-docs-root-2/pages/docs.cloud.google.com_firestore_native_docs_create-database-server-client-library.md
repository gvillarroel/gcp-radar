Create a Firestore database by using a server client library
This quickstart shows you how to set up Firestore, add data, and read
data by using the C#, Go, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, or Ruby server client
library.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.

Go to project selector
Firestore and App Engine:
You can't use both Firestore and Datastore in the same
project, which might affect apps using App Engine. Try using
Firestore with a different project if you need to use
Datastore.
Create a Firestore in Native Mode in Native mode database
If this is a new project, you need to create a Firestore database
instance.
Go to the Firestore viewer .
From the Select a database service screen, choose
Firestore in Native mode .
Select a location for your
Firestore.
If you aren't able to select a location, then your project's
"location for default Google Cloud resources"
has already been set. Some of your project's resources (like the default
Firestore instance) share a common location dependency, and
their location can be set either during project creation or when setting up
another service that shares this location dependency.
Click Create Database .
When you create a Firestore project, it also enables the API in the
Cloud API Manager .
Set up authentication
To run the client library, you must first set up
authentication
by creating a service account and setting an environment variable.
Add the server client library to your app
Add the required dependencies and client libraries to your app.
Java
Add the Firestore Java library to your app:
Using Maven:
<dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>libraries-bom</artifactId>
<version>26.65.0</version>
<type>pom</type>
<scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>google-cloud-firestore</artifactId>
</dependency> pom.xml
If you are using Gradle or setting up without BOM, see the
Firestore Client for Java README.
Using an IDE:
If you're using VS Code, IntelliJ, or Eclipse, you can add
client libraries to your project using these IDE plugins:
Cloud Code for VS Code
Cloud Code for IntelliJ
Cloud Tools for Eclipse
The plugins provide additional functionality, such as key
management for service accounts. Refer to each plugin's
documentation for details.
Python
Add the Firestore Python library to your app:
Note: We recommend that you use a
virtual Python environment
to install the Firestore Python library:
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -- upgrade google - cloud - firestore
Node.js
Add the Firestore Node.js library to your app:
npm install -- save @ google - cloud / firestore
Go
Install the Firestore Go library:
go get cloud . google . com / go / firestore
Add the Firestore Go library to your app:
import "cloud.google.com/go/firestore"
PHP
Install and enable the gRPC extension
for PHP, which you will need to use the client library.
Add the Firestore PHP library to your app:
composer require google/cloud-firestore
C#
Add the Firestore C# library to your app in your .csproj file:
< ItemGroup >
< PackageReference Include = "Google.Cloud.Firestore" Version = "1.1.0-beta01" / >
< / ItemGroup >
Add the following to your Program.cs file:
using Google.Cloud.Firestore ;
Ruby
Add the Firestore Ruby library to your app in your Gemfile :
gem "google-cloud-firestore"
Install dependencies from your Gemfile using:
bundle install
Initialize Firestore in Native Mode
Initialize an instance of Firestore:
Java

Add data
Firestore stores data in Documents, which are stored in Collections.
Firestore creates collections and documents implicitly
the first time you add data to the document. You do not need to explicitly
create collections or documents.
Create a new collection and a document using the following example code.
Java
To authenticate to Firestore, set up Application Default Credentials.
For more information, see
Set up authentication for a local development environment .
DocumentReference docRef = db . collection ( "users" ). document ( "alovelace" );
// Add document data with id "alovelace" using a hashmap
Map<String , Object > data = new HashMap <> ();
data . put ( "first" , "Ada" );
data . put ( "last" , "Lovelace" );
data . put ( "born" , 1815 );
//asynchronously write data
ApiFuture<WriteResult> result = docRef . set ( data );
// ...
// result.get() blocks on response
System . out . println ( "Update time : " + result . get (). getUpdateTime ());
Python

Python (Async)
doc_ref = db.collection("users").document("alovelace")
await doc_ref.set({"first": "Ada", "last": "Lovelace", "born": 1815})

includes a key-value pair (middle name) that does not appear in the first
document. Documents in a collection can contain different sets of information.
