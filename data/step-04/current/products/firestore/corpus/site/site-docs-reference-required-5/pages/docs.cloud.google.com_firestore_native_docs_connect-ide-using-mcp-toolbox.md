Use Firestore with MCP, Gemini CLI, and other agents
This page shows you how to connect your Firestore
database to various developer tools.
For an integrated experience, we recommend using the dedicated
Firestore extension for Gemini CLI .
As Google Cloud's next-generation command-line interface, Gemini CLI
bundles the underlying MCP server directly into the extension, which removes
the need for a separate server setup.
You can configure Gemini Code Assist to use the Gemini CLI,
offering similar setup benefits in your IDE.
For other developer tools that support the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) ,
you can connect by manually configuring the
MCP Toolbox for Databases .
MCP Toolbox is an open-source MCP server that connects AI agents to your
data by managing tasks such as authentication and connection pooling. This lets
you interact with your data using natural language directly from your IDE. For
these tools, this method provides core database interaction capabilities.
This page describes how to use the MCP Toolbox for Databases to
expose your developer assistance tools to a Firestore instance
using the following IDEs:
Gemini CLI
Gemini Code Assist
Cursor
Windsurf (Codium)
Visual Studio Code (Copilot)
Cline (VS Code extension)

About Gemini CLI and extensions
Gemini CLI is an open-source AI agent designed to assist with development workflows by assisting with coding, debugging, data exploration, and content creation. Its mission is to provide an agentic interface for interacting with Data Cloud services and popular open-source databases.
How extensions work
Gemini CLI is highly extensible, allowing for the addition of new tools and capabilities through extensions. You can load the extensions from a GitHub URL, a local directory, or a configurable registry. They provide new tools, slash commands, and prompts to assist with your workflow.
Use the Gemini CLI extension for Firestore
Note: The Firestore Gemini CLI extension is based on
MCP Toolbox for Databases. MCP Toolbox for Databases is currently
in beta (pre-v1.0), and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).
The integration with Gemini CLI is through a dedicated extension that
offers additional capabilities compared to the standard MCP Toolbox connection.
The extension offers a streamlined installation process and a set of tools.
The open-source extension contains detailed information on installation,
configuration, and usage examples. For more information, see the
Gemini CLI Extension - Firestore .
The firestore-native extension includes tools for querying the
database, updating documents, and managing Firestore security rules.
Category
Tools
Example natural language prompt
Document and data retrieval
get_documents
Show me the Firestore data for the test users qa_user_123 and qa_user_456 from the users-staging collection.
list_collections
List all subcollections under the users-staging collection.
query_collection
Find all users in the users-staging collection whose wishlist contains product-glasses.
Document updates and deletions
add_documents
Add document qa_user_789 to the users-staging collection with fields name: tester1 and location: USA.
delete_documents
Delete document qa_user_789 from the users-staging collection.
update_document
Update the document with ID order-987 in the orders collection to set the status to 'Shipped'.
For all 20 test users you just found, please remove product-glasses(inactive) from their wishlist.
Security rules management
get_rules
Show me the active Firestore security rules for this database.
validate_rules
new_rules.txt is a new Firestore Security Rule I'm working on for staging. Can you validate it for me?
Before you begin
To use the tools in the Gemini CLI extension for Firestore, you must have one of the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, or a custom role with equivalent permissions:
Task
Role name
Required Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
Read and write data in Firestore database
Cloud Datastore User
roles/datastore.user
View and test security rules
Firebase Rules Viewer
roles/firebaserules.viewer
Set up Firestore
Create a new Google Cloud project or select an existing one .
Enable the Firestore in Native Mode API for your project.
Create a Firestore database if you haven't already.
Set up authentication for your local environment.
Install gcloud CLI
Run gcloud auth application-default login to authenticate
Configure the MCP client
This section describes how to configure various developer tools to connect to your Firestore instance using the MCP Toolbox for Databases . The toolbox acts as an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that sits between your IDE and your database, providing a secure and efficient control plane for your AI tools. Select the tab for one of the following tools to see the configuration instructions.
Gemini CLI
Install the Gemini CLI .
Install the Firestore extension for Gemini CLI from the GitHub repository using the following command:
gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/firestore-native
Set environment variables to connect to your Firestore database.
The FIRESTORE_DATABASE variable is optional and defaults to (default) :
export FIRESTORE_PROJECT=" PROJECT_ID "
export FIRESTORE_DATABASE=" DATABASE_NAME "
The Gemini CLI extension for Firestore uses your application default credentials (ADC) for authentication.
Start the Gemini CLI in interactive mode:
gemini
The CLI automatically loads the Firestore extension for Gemini CLI extension and its tools, which you can use to interact with your database.
Gemini Code Assist
We recommend to configure Gemini Code Assist to use the Gemini CLI, this approach removes the need to manually configure an MCP server.
Make sure you have installed and configured the Gemini CLI and the firestore-native extension .
Configure Gemini Code Assist to use the Gemini CLI .
Start interacting with your Firestore database using natural language directly within the Gemini Code Assist chat.
