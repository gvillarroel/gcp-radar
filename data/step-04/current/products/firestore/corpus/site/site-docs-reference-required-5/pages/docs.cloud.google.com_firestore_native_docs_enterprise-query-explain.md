Analyze query execution with Query Explain
Preview
— Firestore in Native mode (with Pipeline Operations) for Enterprise Edition
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
You can process personal data for
this feature
as outlined in the
Cloud Data
Processing Addendum , subject to the obligations and restrictions described in the
agreement under which you access Google Cloud.
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This page describes how to retrieve query execution information when you execute a query.
Use Query Explain
You can use Query Explain to understand how your queries are being executed.
This provides details that you can use to optimize your queries .
You can use Query Explain through the Google Cloud console.
Console
Execute a query in the Query Editor and open the Explanation tab:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
From the list of databases, select a Firestore database.
The Google Cloud console opens the Firestore Explorer for that database.
Enter a query in the query editor and click Run .
Click the Explanation tab to view the query analysis output.
Analysis
The output of Query Explain contains two main components-the Summary Statistics and Execution Tree.
Consider this query as an example:
db.pipeline().collection('/users').sort(field("status").ascending()).limit(100)
Summary Statistics
The top of the explained output contains a summary of the execution statistics.
Use these statistics to determine if a query has high latency or cost. It also
contains memory statistics which let you know how close your query is
to memory limits .
Execution:
results returned: 2
request peak memory usage: 20.25 KiB (20,736 B)
data bytes read: 148 B
entity row scanned: 2
Billing:
read units: 1
Execution Tree
The execution tree describes the query execution as a series of nodes. The
bottom nodes (leaf nodes) retrieve data from the storage layer which traverses
up the tree to generate a query response.
For details about each execution node,
refer to the Execution reference .
For details on how to use this information to optimize your queries,
see Optimize query execution .
The following is an example of an execution tree:
Tree:
• Compute
| $out_1: map_set($record_1, "__name__", $__name___1, "__key__", unset)
| is query result: true
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 2
| latency: 5.96 ms (local <1 ms)
|
└── • Compute
| $__name___1: map_get($record_1, "__key__")
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 2
| latency: 5.88 ms (local <1 ms)
|
└── • MajorSort
| fields: [$v_1 ASC]
| output: [$record_1]
| limit: 100
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 2
| latency: 5.86 ms (local <1 ms)
| peak memory usage: 20.25 KiB (20,736 B)
|
└── • Compute
| $v_1: map_get($record_1, "status")
|
| Execution:
| records returned: 2
| latency: 5.23 ms (local <1 ms)
|
└── • TableScan
source: /users
order: UNDEFINED
properties: *
row range: (-∞..+∞)
output record: $record_1
variables: [$record_1]
Execution:
records returned: 2
latency: 4.68 ms
records scanned: 2
data bytes read: 148 B
