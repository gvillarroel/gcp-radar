Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how generative AI agents connect to
Firestore.
Due to the inherent risks of autonomous agents,
mitigating vulnerabilities like prompt injection requires a shared
responsibility model, combining platform controls with secure application
design.
To design and deploy AI applications that use Google Cloud Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools, follow the best practices in this guide.
Before you begin
When you use MCP tools, your application's security posture depends on the
agent's interaction model. To learn how your use of agents impacts the security
risks associated with integrating agents with an MCP server, see AI security and
safety .
Security responsibilities
As a customer, you are responsible for the secure configuration and operation
of your agent platform.
Follow the principle of least privilege
Run your agent with a minimally-scoped service account. This is the first and
most critical layer of defense.
Dedicated identity: Create a separate, dedicated
service account for each unique agent or application using MCP tools. Do not
reuse existing SAs, especially those with broad permissions.
Minimal scopes: Grant the service account only the
necessary Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles—for example, alloydb.viewer , not
alloydb.admin . If the agent only needs read access to a specific
dataset, use custom IAM roles to restrict access to the absolute minimum needed
for its function.
Separation of duties: If an agent needs both read access to
data and write access to a log or temporary storage, use two separate service
accounts—one account for high-risk data access (minimally scoped) and one for
low-risk operational tasks.
Use database-native granular controls
For the strongest defense, combine IAM roles with the granular access
controls offered by the database itself. This ensures that even if an attacker
compromises the agent's IAM token, the scope of damage is limited by the
database engine's internal permissions—for example, preventing a
Delete Database
command.
Product
Granular Control Mechanism
Focus
Cloud SQL and AlloyDB
Database-level roles like CREATE ROLE in PostgreSQL and
MySQL.
Manage permissions in a specific database instance and
schemas.
BigQuery

Bigtable
IAM roles
Bigtable offers granular control through IAM roles at the project, instance, and table levels.
Secure agent design
Agent-Only models require robust application-level defenses against prompt
injection attacks, which attempt to override the system prompt. For more
information, see AI safety and
security .
Treat data and user inputs as untrusted
Treat input from end users, or data fetched by the agent from external
sources—like a web search result or a third-party document—as untrusted.
Implement action-selection patterns
Avoid open-ended plan and execute architectures , in which
the system decouples high-level task specification from mechanical execution.
Instead, use design patterns that limit the model's freedom.
Action-selector pattern: the model's only job is to
translate a user request into one of a small, pre-defined set of safe functions.
The action logic is hard-coded and can't be modified by the LLM. This helps to
make the agent immune to injection attacks targeting control flow.
Dual-LLM pattern: use a primary LLM (the action LLM) that
performs the core task, and a secondary, highly-secure LLM (the guardrail LLM)
that pre-screens the user prompt for malicious intent and post-screens the
action LLM's output for unauthorized actions or data leakage.
Prevent unauthorized tool chaining
Agents must only call tools that are necessary for the task. Make sure that
your orchestration code prevents the following:
Dynamic tools: the agent must not be able to
dynamically register new tools or change the permissions of existing tools.
Allowlist enforcement: declare an allowlist of functions or
database tables that the agent can access in its initial system prompt and
backend code. For a Gemini CLI example, see Restricting
Tool Access .
Limit data access in multi-tenant databases
A general tool like execute_sql lets the caller execute database
queries that can read any data that IAM and database permissions allow access
to. When you create an agent that accesses data in a multi-tenant application
without a trusted human in the loop, you might need to limit data access
further.
To make sure that the agent can only read subsets of the data that it
has access to, we recommend that you create custom tools using a framework like
MCP Toolbox for
Databases . For more information, see Prebuilt vs. Custom Tools .
For example, imagine that your database stores orders for all end users in
the Orders table. You're developing a chat agent that interacts
with users and can look up their orders. The chat agent has permission to read
the entire Orders table, but one end user must not be able to
request information about another user's orders.
In an unsafe scenario, you equip the agent with only an
execute_sql tool, creating a risk for a data leak. A
malicious user can trick the agent into reading and returning other users' orders.
Instructing the agent to enforce the access rules is typically not
sufficient to protect the data.
In a safe scenario, you give the agent a more specific custom
tool—like lookup_active_order —where the identity of the user in the
query filter is set outside of the agent's control.
Security and safety configurations
Firestore
provides Model Armor to enforce safety boundaries at the
platform level. You must enable and configure these settings.
Enable Model Armor
Use the Google Cloud CLI to enable Model Armor on your model deployment. This
activates built-in protection against known attack vectors like injection and
jailbreaking.
The following example enables Model Armor on a Vertex AI endpoint.
# Example: Enable Model Armor on a Vertex AI endpoint
gcloud ai endpoints update ENDPOINT_ID \
--region=REGION \
--enable-model-armor
For more information and examples, see Configure
Model Armor protection for MCP on Google Cloud .
Enforce minimum safety thresholds for sensitive data operations
Model Armor lets you enforce a minimum safety threshold for sensitive data
operations—for example, personally identifiable information (PII) detection and
de-identification. Use a Sensitive Data Protection DeidentifyTemplate
to redact or mask sensitive information before it's returned to the user, even
if the model is compromised.
The following is a conceptual example for configuration:
# Example: Apply a DeidentifyTemplate to filter PII
gcloud ai endpoints update ENDPOINT_ID \
--region=REGION \
--model-armor-config-file=model_armor_config.json
In the following example, model_armor_config.json might reference a DLP template:
{
"safety_thresholds": {
"injection": "HIGH",
"harmful_content": "MEDIUM"
},
"data_protection_config": {
"dlp_deidentify_template": "projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/LOCATION/deidentifyTemplates/DLP_TEMPLATE_ID"
}
}
Auditing and observability
Visibility into agent actions is crucial for post-incident analysis and
detection of compromised agents.
Implement a data recovery strategy
While layered controls like IAM and database-native roles are designed to
prevent destructive actions, you must have a recovery plan in case those
defenses fail. A compromised or naive agent with write permissions (an
"Agent-Only" risk) might be tricked into executing a destructive command like
Delete Database
or corrupting data.
Your primary defense against this scenario is a robust recovery
strategy.
Nearly all Data Cloud products provide features for data recovery, either
through traditional backups, point-in-time recovery (PITR), or data snapshots.
You are responsible for enabling and configuring these features.
Product
Backup and recovery mechanisms
Cloud SQL
Supports both on-demand and automated backups, allowing you to
restore an instance to a previous state. It also supports
Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR).
AlloyDB
Provides continuous backup and recovery by default. This enables PITR
with microsecond granularity, allowing you to restore a cluster to
any time in your retention window.
BigQuery
Data recovery is achieved using "Time Travel," which lets you access
and restore data from any point in the last 7 days. For longer-term
retention, you can create Table Snapshots.
Spanner
Supports both on-demand backups and PITR.
Firestore
Supports automated backups that let you restore a database to a previous state. It also offers
PITR to protect against accidental deletions or writes. Both of these features are disabled by default.
Bigtable
Supports on-demand and automated backups. These backups are fully
managed and can be restored to a new table.
Enable Cloud Audit Logs
Make sure that Data Access
audit logs are enabled for MCP as well as all relevant Google Cloud services
like BigQuery, Cloud SQL, AlloyDB, Firestore, and Spanner. By default, only Admin
Activity audit logs are enabled. Data Access audit logs record every read
and write operation performed by the agent. For more information, see Data
access audit logs for MCP .
Audit sensitive actions
Configure
alerts in Cloud Logging to detect anomalous or high-risk actions. The Logs Explorer
query identifies service accounts performing data write
operations in Firestore, for example, which is a common target for exfiltration
or destructive attacks:
resource.type="firestore_database"
# Filter for data write operations
AND protoPayload.methodName="google.firestore.v1.Firestore.Commit"
# Ensure the caller is an agent service account (modify regex as needed)
AND protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail=~".*@.*.gserviceaccount.com"
# Exclude expected system calls to reduce noise
AND NOT protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail=~"system-managed-service-account"
Use agent-specific logging
In addition to Cloud Audit Logs, make sure that your application code logs
the following data for every agent decision:
Tool execution: the MCP tool that was called.
Raw command: the exact command—for example, a
Firestore query
or document path—generated by the LLM.
Final action: whether the action is executed (Agent-Only
model) or approved (Human-in-the-Middle). For more information, see Understand
agent use .
User and session ID: the identifier for the end user who
initiated the request.
