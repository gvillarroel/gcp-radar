Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Data model
Firestore is a NoSQL, document-oriented database. Unlike a SQL database,
there are no tables or rows. Instead, you store data in documents , which are
organized into collections .
Each document contains a set of key-value pairs. Firestore is
optimized for storing large collections of small documents.
All documents must be stored in collections. Documents can contain
subcollections and nested objects, both of which can include primitive fields
like strings or complex objects like lists.
Collections and documents are created implicitly in Firestore.
Simply assign data to a document within a collection. If either the collection
or document does not exist, Firestore creates it.
Documents
In Firestore, the unit of storage is the document. A document is a
lightweight record that contains fields, which map to values. Each document is
identified by a name.
A document representing a user alovelace might look like this:
class alovelace
first : "Ada"
last : "Lovelace"
born : 1815
Note: Firestore supports a variety of data types for values:
boolean, number, string, geo point, binary blob, and timestamp. You can also use
arrays or nested objects, called maps, to structure data within a document.
Complex, nested objects in a document are called maps. For example, you could
structure the user's name from the example above with a map, like this:
class alovelace
name :
first : "Ada"
last : "Lovelace"
born : 1815
You may notice that documents look a lot like JSON. In fact, they basically are.
There are some differences (for example, documents support extra data types and
are limited to the document size limit ), but in general, you can treat documents as
lightweight JSON records.
Collections
Documents live in collections, which are simply containers for documents. For
example, you could have a users collection to contain your various users, each
represented by a document:
collections_bookmark users
class alovelace
first : "Ada"
last : "Lovelace"
born : 1815
class aturing
first : "Alan"
last : "Turing"
born : 1912
Firestore is schemaless, so you have complete freedom over what
fields you put in each document and what data types you store in those fields.
Documents within the same collection can all contain different fields or store
different types of data in those fields. However, it's a good idea to use the
same fields and data types across multiple documents, so that you can query the
documents more easily.
A collection contains documents and nothing else. It can't directly contain raw
fields with values, and it can't contain other collections. (See Hierarchical
Data for an explanation of how to structure more complex
data in Firestore.)
The names of documents within a collection are unique. You can provide your own
keys, such as user IDs, or you can let Firestore create random IDs
for you automatically.
You do not need to "create" or "delete" collections. After you create the first
document in a collection, the collection exists. If you delete all of the
documents in a collection, it no longer exists.
References
Every document in Firestore is uniquely identified by its location
within the database. The previous example showed a document alovelace within
the collection users . To refer to this location in your code, you can create a
reference to it.

A reference is a lightweight object that just points to a location in your
database. You can create a reference whether or not data exists there, and
creating a reference does not perform any network operations.
You can also create references to collections :

Note: Collection references and document references are two distinct types
of references and let you perform different operations. For example, you could
use a collection reference for querying the documents in the collection, and you
could use a document reference to read or write an individual document.
For convenience, you can also create references by specifying the path to a
document or collection as a string, with path components separated by a forward
slash ( / ). For example, to create a reference to the alovelace document:

Hierarchical Data
To understand how hierarchical data structures work in Firestore,
consider an example chat app with messages and chat rooms.
You can create a collection called rooms to store different chat rooms:
collections_bookmark rooms
class roomA
name : "my chat room"
class roomB
...
Now that you have chat rooms, decide how to store your messages. You might not
want to store them in the chat room's document. Documents in Firestore
should be lightweight, and a chat room could contain a large number of messages.
However, you can create additional collections within your chat room's document,
as subcollections.
Subcollections
The best way to store messages in this scenario is by using subcollections. A
subcollection is a collection associated with a specific document.
Note: You can query across subcollections with the same collection ID by using
Collection Group Queries .
You can create a subcollection called messages for every room document in
your rooms collection:
collections_bookmark rooms
class roomA
name : "my chat room"
collections_bookmark
messages
class
message1
from : "alex"
msg : "Hello World!"
class
message2
...
class roomB
...
In this example, you would create a reference to a message in the subcollection
with the following code:
Web version 9
import { doc } from "firebase/firestore" ;
const messageRef = doc ( db , "rooms" , "roomA" , "messages" , "message1" ); subcollection_reference . js
Web version 8

. collection ( 'messages' ). doc ( 'message1' ); test . firestore . js

db . collection ( "rooms" ). document ( "roomA" ). collection ( "messages" ). document ( "message1" ); References . java

Notice the alternating pattern of collections and documents. Your collections
and documents must always follow this pattern. You cannot reference a collection
in a collection or a document in a document.
Subcollections allow you to structure data hierarchically, making data easier to
access. To get all messages in roomA , you can create a collection reference
to the subcollection messages and interact with it like you would any other
collection reference.
Documents in subcollections can contain subcollections as well, allowing you to
further nest data. You can nest data up to 100 levels deep.
Warning: Deleting a document does not delete its subcollections! When
you delete a document that has subcollections, those subcollections are
not deleted. For example, there may be a document located at coll/doc/subcoll/subdoc
even though the document coll/doc no longer exists. If you want to delete
documents in subcollections when deleting a parent document, you must do so manually,
as shown in Delete
Collections .
