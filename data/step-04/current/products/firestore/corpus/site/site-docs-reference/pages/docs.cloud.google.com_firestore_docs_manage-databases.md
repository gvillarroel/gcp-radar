Create and manage databases
This page describes how to create, update, and delete Firestore
databases. You can create multiple Firestore databases per
project. You can use multiple databases to set up production and testing
environments, to isolate customer data, and for data regionalization.
Required roles and permissions
To create and manage databases, you'll need the following Identity and Access Management role:
Cloud Datastore Owner
( roles/datastore.owner )
That role grants the following permissions that you need to create and manage
databases:
Create a database: datastore.databases.create
Read database configuration: datastore.databases.getMetadata
Configure a database: datastore.databases.update
Delete a database: datastore.databases.delete
Clone a database: datastore.databases.clone
Create a database
To create a database, use one of the following methods:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Click Create a Firestore database .
Enter a database ID.
Select a Firestore edition. See the
editions overview
to learn more about each edition.
Select a data access mode. The data access mode configures which API and
which client libraries you can use with your database.
If you select Firestore in Native mode:
Configure your initial security rules. Select Restrictive if you
don't plan to use the Firebase mobile and web SDKs.
If you selected Enterprise edition, enable or disable
real-time updates for your database.
Select a location.
(Optional) If you need Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK),
expand and configure the encryption options .
Click Create Database .
gcloud
Use the
gcloud firestore databases create
command.
To create a Firestore Enterprise edition database
in Native mode:
gcloud firestore databases create \
--database= DATABASE_ID \
--location= LOCATION \
--edition=enterprise \
--enable-firestore-data-access \
--no-enable-mongodb-compatible-data-access \
--enable-realtime-updates
Replace the following:
DATABASE_ID : a valid database ID .
LOCATION : the name of a Firestore multi-region or
region .
To create a Firestore Standard edition database:
gcloud firestore databases create \
-- database = DATABASE_ID \
-- location = LOCATION \
-- edition = standard
-- type = DATABASE_TYPE
Replace the following:
DATABASE_ID : a valid database ID .
LOCATION : the name of a Firestore multi-region or
region .
DATABASE_TYPE : either firestore-native for Native mode or
datastore-mode for Datastore mode.
--delete-protection is an optional flag to enable deletion protection.
You cannot delete a database with deletion protection enabled until you
disable this setting. This setting is disabled by default.
To add tags
to the database, use the
--tags
flag. For example:
--tags=123/environment=production,123/costCenter=marketing
--tags=tagKeys/333=tagValues/444
Firebase CLI
firebase firestore:databases:create DATABASE_ID \
--location= LOCATION \
[--delete-protection DELETE_PROTECTION_ENABLEMENT ]
Replace the following:
DATABASE_ID : a valid database ID .
LOCATION : the name of a
Firestore multi-region or region .
DELETE_PROTECTION_ENABLEMENT : Either ENABLED or DISABLED .
The database created is always in Native mode.
--delete-protection is an optional
argument to enable deletion protection. You cannot delete a database with
deletion protection enabled until you disable this setting. This setting is
disabled by default.
Terraform
resource "google_firestore_database" "database" {
project = "project-id"
name = DATABASE_ID
location_id = LOCATION
type = DATABASE_TYPE
// Optional
delete_protection_state = DELETE_PROTECTION_STATE
}
Replace the following:
DATABASE_ID : a valid database ID .
LOCATION : the name of a
Firestore multi-region or region .
DATABASE_TYPE : either FIRESTORE_NATIVE for Native mode or
DATASTORE_MODE for Datastore mode.
DELETE_PROTECTION_ENABLEMENT : Either
DELETE_PROTECTION_ENABLED or DELETE_PROTECTION_DISABLED .
delete_protection_state is an optional argument to enable deletion
protection. You cannot delete a database with deletion protection enabled
until you disable this setting. This setting is disabled by default.
Database ID
A valid database Id must conform to these rules:
Only include letters, numbers, and hyphen ( - ) characters.
Letters must be lowercase.
The first character must be a letter.
The last character must be a letter or number.
Minimum of 4 characters.
Maximum of 63 characters.
Must not be a UUID or resemble a UUID. For example, don't use an ID like
f47ac10b-58cc-0372-8567-0e02b2c3d479 .
There is one exception to these rules: Standard edition will
create a database named (default) if you don't enter an ID yourself.
Note that after you delete a database, you can't re-use its ID for
about 5 minutes.
Delete protection
Use delete protection to prevent accidental deletion of a database.
You cannot delete a database with delete protection enabled until you disable
delete protection. Delete protection is disabled by default. You can update
the database configuration to enable or disable delete protection .
Set up Firestore Security Rules for your databases
Use the Firebase CLI to deploy Firestore Security Rules to each of your
databases. Refer to the guide for managing and deploying Firestore Security Rules .
Access a named database with a client library
A named database includes any database not named (default) . By default,
the Firebase SDKs and Google API Client Libraries connect to the (default)
Firestore database in a project. To create a client connected
to a named database, set the database ID when you instantiate a client.
Note: To work with multiple databases, be sure to update to the latest
Firebase
Client SDKs
and
Google API Client Libraries .
List databases
Use one of the following methods to list your databases:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Note: You can view and list your databases in the Google Cloud console. You can create the (default) database
using the Google Cloud console, but you must use the Google Cloud CLI or another method to create a named database.
To delete a database use the Google Cloud CLI .
gcloud
Use the
gcloud firestore databases list
command to list all the databases in your project.
gcloud firestore databases list
Firebase CLI
Use the firebase firestore:databases:list command to list all the databases in your project.
firebase firestore:databases:list
View database details
To view details about a single database, use one of the following methods:
gcloud
Use the gcloud firestore databases describe command:
gcloud firestore databases describe --database= DATABASE_ID
Firebase CLI
Use the firebase firestore:databases:get command:
firebase firestore:databases:get DATABASE_ID
Replace DATABASE_ID with a database ID.
Update database configuration
To update the configurations settings of a database, use the
gcloud firestore databases update
command.
Use this command to change the database type or to toggle delete
protection.
Change the database type
To update the type of a database, use the
gcloud firestore databases update
command with the --type= flag. You can change the type only if the database
is empty.
gcloud
gcloud firestore databases update -- database = DATABASE_ID \
-- type = DATABASE_TYPE
Replace the following:
DATABASE_ID : a database ID.
DATABASE_TYPE : either firestore-native for Native mode
or datastore-mode for Datastore mode.
Update the delete protection setting
To enable delete protection on a database, use the
gcloud firestore databases update
command with the --delete-protection flag. For example:
gcloud
gcloud firestore databases update --database= DATABASE_ID --delete-protection
Replace DATABASE_ID with a database ID.
To disable delete protection on a database, use the
gcloud firestore databases update
command with the --no-delete-protection flag. For example:
gcloud
gcloud firestore databases update --database= DATABASE_ID --no-delete-protection
Replace DATABASE_ID with a database ID.
Delete a database
To delete a database, use the console or command-line tool.
If the database has the delete protection setting enabled, you must
first disable delete protection .
If the database contains App Engine search data or
blob entities ,
you must delete that data first.
Deleting a database does not automatically delete any
Eventarc triggers for that database. The
trigger stops delivering events but continues to exist until you
delete the trigger .
Deleting a database does not incur charges for delete operations.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Click more_vert View more in the
table row for the database you want to delete. Click Delete . A dialog
appears.
In the Delete database? dialog, confirm deletion by typing the
database ID in the text field. Click Delete . The console informs you
of operation success or failure.
If the operation fails,
view the database details and verify that
delete protection is disabled. To disable delete protection, see
Update the delete protection setting .
gcloud
Use the
`gcloud firestore databases delete` command.
gcloud firestore databases delete --database= DATABASE_ID
Replace DATABASE_ID with the ID of the database to delete. To delete the default database use the ID '(default)'
Clone a database
You can clone an existing database at a selected timestamp into a new database:
The cloned database is a new database that will be created in the same
location as the source database.
To make a clone, Firestore uses
point-in-time recovery (PITR) data of the source database. The cloned database includes all data and indexes.
By default, the cloned database will be encrypted in the same way as the
source database, using either Google's default encryption or
CMEK encryption . You can specify a different
encryption type or use a different key for CMEK encryption.
The timestamp has a granularity of one minute and specifies a point of time
in the past, in the period defined by the
PITR window :
If PITR is enabled for your database, you select any minute in the last 7
days (or less if PITR was enabled less than 7 days ago).
If PITR isn't enabled, you can select any minute in the past hour.
You can check the earliest timestamp that you can pick
in your database's description .
Note: To clone databases, your Google Account must have the
datastore.databases.clone IAM permission .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Click more_vert View more in the
table row for the database that you want to clone. Click Clone . The
Create a clone dialog appears.
In the Create a clone dialog, provide parameters for cloning the
database:
In the Give the clone an ID field, a
database ID
for a new cloned database. This database ID must not be associated
with an existing database.
In the Clone from field, select a point in time to use for cloning.
The selected time corresponds to a PITR timestamp, at the minute
granularity.
Click Create clone .
Note: The cloned database will have the same encryption configuration as
the source database. If you want to specify a different encryption
configuration for the cloned database, you can use Google Cloud CLI commands.
gcloud
Use the
gcloud firestore databases clone
command to clone a database:
gcloud firestore databases clone \
--source-database = ' SOURCE_DATABASE ' \
--snapshot-time = ' PITR_TIMESTAMP ' \
--destination-database = ' DESTINATION_DATABASE_ID '
Replace the following:
SOURCE_DATABASE : the database name of an existing database that you want to clone. The name uses the format projects/ PROJECT_ID /databases/ SOURCE_DATABASE_ID .
PITR_TIMESTAMP : a
PITR timestamp in the
RFC 3339 format , at minute
granularity. For example:
2025-06-01T10:20:00.00Z or 2025-06-01T10:30:00.00-07:00 .
DESTINATION_DATABASE_ID : a
database ID
for a new cloned database. This database ID must not be associated with
an existing database.
Example:
gcloud firestore databases clone \
--source-database = 'projects/example-project/databases/(default)' \
--snapshot-time = '2025-06-01T10:20:00.00Z' \
--destination-database = 'example-dest-db'
If you want to bind to some tags while cloning a database, use the previous command with the --tags flag, which is an optional list of tags KEY=VALUE pairs to bind.
Example:
gcloud firestore databases clone \
--source-database = 'projects/example-project/databases/(default)' \
--snapshot-time = '2025-06-01T10:20:00.00Z' \
--destination-database = 'example-dest-db'
By default, the cloned database will have the same encryption configuration
as the source database. To change the encryption configuration, use the
--encryption-type argument:
(Default) use-source-encryption : use the same encryption configuration
as the source database.
google-default-encryption : use Google's default encryption.
customer-managed-encryption : use CMEK encryption. Specify a
key ID
in the --kms-key-name argument.
The following example shows how to configure CMEK encryption for the cloned
database:
gcloud firestore databases clone \
--source-database = 'projects/example-project/databases/(default)' \
--snapshot-time = '2025-06-01T10:20:00.00Z' \
--destination-database = 'example-dest-db' \
--encryption-type = 'customer-managed-encryption' \
--kms-key-name = 'projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/keyRings/example-key-ring/cryptoKeys/example-key'
Configure per-database access permissions
You can use
Identity and Access Management Conditions
to configure access permissions on a per-database level.
The following examples use the Google Cloud CLI to assign conditional access for
one or more databases. You can also
define IAM conditions in the Google Cloud console .
Warning: The Google Cloud console does not allow/deny access to databases
based on IAM conditions configured at the database level. This
only applies to accessing databases with the Google Cloud console.
IAM conditions are enforced when accessing databases outside of
the Google Cloud console such as with the REST API or the client libraries.
View existing IAM policies
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID
Set PROJECT_ID to your project ID.
Grant access to a database
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = 'user: EMAIL ' \
--role = 'roles/datastore.user' \
--condition = 'expression=resource.name=="projects/ PROJECT_ID /databases/ DATABASE_ID ",title= TITLE ,description= DESCRIPTION '
Set the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID
EMAIL : an email address that represents a specific Google Account. For example, alice@example.com .
DATABASE_ID : a database ID.
TITLE : an optional title for the expression.
DESCRIPTION : an optional description of the expression.
Grant access to all except one database
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = 'user: EMAIL ' \
--role = 'roles/datastore.user' \
--condition = 'expression=resource.name!="projects/ PROJECT_ID /databases/ DATABASE_ID ",title= TITLE ,description= DESCRIPTION '
Set the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID
EMAIL : an email address that represents a specific Google Account. For example, alice@example.com .
DATABASE_ID : a database ID.
TITLE : an optional title for the expression.
DESCRIPTION : an optional description of the expression.
Remove policies for a given member and role
gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = 'user: EMAIL ' \
--role = 'roles/datastore.user' --all
Set the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID
EMAIL : an email address that represents a specific Google Account. For example, alice@example.com .
Cloud Monitoring
Firestore metrics are reported under two monitored resources.
firestore.googleapis.com/Database
firestore_instance (Legacy)
You can inspect aggregate metrics at the database level by looking at firestore.googleapis.com/Database . The metrics reported under firestore_instance are aggregated at the project level.
Limitations
You can have a maximum of 100 databases per project. You can contact support to request an increase to this limit.
You cannot delete your (default) database if it contains any GAE search data .
Use the index delete api to delete GAE search data. If you recently deleted GAE Search data, there may be a waiting period before you are able to delete the database.
You cannot delete your (default) database if it contains any blob entities . Use the Blobstore delete api to delete Blobstore data.
You can check if your (default) database has Blobstore data by running the following GQL query
in the Google Cloud console: SELECT * FROM __BlobInfo__ .
You cannot reuse a database ID until 5 minutes after the delete happens.
Cloud Function v1 does not support Firestore Named databases. Use Cloud Firestore Triggers (2nd Gen) to configure events for named databases.
Firestore function triggers v1 and Firestore event triggers may stop working after the database is deleted, even if a new database is created with the same name.
