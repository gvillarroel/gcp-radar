Standard edition index overview
Indexing behavior depends on the edition of the database. This page
describes indexing for Firestore Standard edition. For Firestore Enterprise edition,
see Firestore Enterprise edition index overview .
Indexes are an important factor in the performance of a database. Much like the
index of a book which maps topics in a book to page numbers, a database index
maps the items in a database to their locations in the database. When you query
a database, the database can use an index to quickly identify the locations of
the items that you requested.
This page describes the two types of indexes that Firestore Standard edition uses,
automatic indexes and manual indexes .
Index definition and structure
An index is defined on a list of fields of a given document, with a
corresponding index mode for each field.
An index contains an entry for every field named in the index definition. The
index includes all documents that are the potential results for queries based on
the index. A document is included in the index only if it has an indexed value
set for every field used in the index. If the index definition refers to a field
for which the document has no value set, that document won't appear in the index.
In this case, the document will never be returned as a result for any query based on the index.
The index is sorted by field values, in the order specified in the
index definition.
An index behind every query
If no index exists for a query, most databases crawl through their contents item
by item, a slow process that slows down even more as the database grows.
Firestore Standard edition guarantees high query performance by using indexes for
all queries. As a result, query performance depends on the size
of the result set and not on the number of items in the database.
Less index management, more app development
Firestore Standard edition includes features that reduce the amount of time that you
need to spend on index management. The indexes required for the most basic
queries are automatically created for you. As you use and test your app,
Firestore Standard edition helps you identify and
create additional indexes that your app requires.
Index types
Firestore Standard edition uses two types of indexes: automatic and
manual . Manual and automatic indexes differ in how you manage them.
Note: Automatic and manual indexes were previously known as single-field and
composite indexes , respectively. We updated the names to reflect additional
indexing features.
Automatic indexes
By default, Firestore Standard edition automatically builds indexes for each field
present in the documents in a collection. These single-field indexes let you
perform many basic queries. You manage automatic indexes by
configuring your database's automatic indexing settings and index exemptions.
Automatic index defaults
Firestore Standard edition uses the following default settings for automatic indexes:
For each non-array and non-map field, Firestore Standard edition defines two
collection-scope indexes, one in ascending mode
and one in descending mode.
For each map field, Firestore Standard edition creates the following:
One collection-scope ascending index for each non-array, non-map subfield.
One collection-scope descending index for each non-array, non-map subfield.
One collection-scope ascending index for the whole map value
One collection-scope descending index for the whole map value
One collection-scope array-contains index for each array subfield.
Firestore Standard edition recursively indexes each map subfield.
For each array field in a document, Firestore Standard edition creates the following:
One collection-scope ascending index for the whole array value
One collection-scope descending index for the whole array value
One collection-scope array-contains index.
Automatic indexes with collection group scope are not maintained by
default.
Automatic index exemptions
You can exempt a field from your automatic indexing
settings by creating an indexing exemption.
An indexing exemption overrides the database-wide automatic index settings. An
exemption can enable an index that your automatic indexing settings
would otherwise disable or disable an index that automatic indexing
would otherwise enable. For cases where exemptions can be useful, see the
indexing best practices .
Use the * field path value to add collection-level index exemptions on all
fields in a collection group. For example, for collection group comments , set
the field path to * to match all fields in the comments collection group and
disable indexing of all the fields under the collection group. You can then add
exemptions to index only the fields required for your queries. Reducing the
number of indexed fields reduces storage costs and can improve write
performance.
If you create an index exemption for a map field, the map's
subfields inherit those settings. You can, however, define index
exemptions for specific subfields. If you delete an exemption for a subfield,
the subfield will inherit its parent's exemption settings, if they exist, or the
database-wide settings if no parent exemptions exist.
Note: An exemption only applies to automatic index settings. A field exempted
from automatic indexing can still be indexed as part of a manual index.
To create and manage automatic index exemptions, see
Manage indexes .
Manual indexes
A manual index stores a sorted mapping of all the documents in a collection,
based on an ordered list of fields to index.
Note: You can have at most one array field per index.
Firestore Standard edition uses manual indexes to support
queries not already supported by automatic indexes.
By default, Firestore Standard edition automatically creates single-field indexes
for each field present within a collection. Firestore Standard edition doesn't
automatically create indexes for combinations of
fields because of the large number of possible field
combinations. Instead, Firestore Standard edition helps you
identify and create required indexes as you build your app.
Any time you attempt a query that isn't supported by an existing index, Firestore Standard edition
returns an error message with a link that you can follow to create the missing
index.
You can also define and manage indexes manually
by using the console or by using the Firebase CLI .
For more on creating and managing manual indexes, see Manage indexes .
Index modes and query scopes
You configure automatic and manual indexes differently, but both require
that you configure index modes and query scopes for your indexes.
Index modes
When you define an index, you select an index mode for each indexed field. Each
field's index mode supports specific query clauses on that field. You
can select from the following index modes:
Index mode
Description
Ascending arrow_upward
Supports < , <= , == , >= , > , != , in , and not-in , query clauses on the field and supports sorting results in ascending order based on this field value.
Descending arrow_downward
Supports < , <= , == , >= , > , != , in , and not-in query clauses on the field and supports sorting results in descending order based on this field value.
Array‑contains
Supports array-contains and array-contains-any query clauses on the field.
Vector
Supports FindNearest query clauses on the field.
Query scopes
Each index is scoped to either a collection or a collection group. This is known
as the index's query scope:
Collection scope
Firestore Standard edition creates indexes with collection scope by default.
These indexes support queries that return results from a single collection.
Collection group scope
A collection group includes all collections with the same collection ID. To
run a collection group query that returns filtered
or ordered results from a collection group, you must create a corresponding
index with collection group scope.
Default ordering and the __name__ field
In addition to sorting documents by the index modes
specified for each field (ascending or descending) , indexes apply a final
sorting by the __name__ field of each document. The value of the __name__
field is set to the full document path. This means that documents
in the result set with the same field values are sorted by document path.
By default, the __name__ field is sorted in the same direction of the last
sorted field in the index definition. For example:
Collection
Fields indexed
Query scope
cities
arrow_upward name, arrow_upward __name__
Collection
cities
arrow_downward state, arrow_downward __name__
Collection
cities
arrow_upward country, arrow_upward population, arrow_upward __name__
Collection
To sort results by the non-default __name__ direction, you need to
create that index.
Index properties
An index that allows the query to be executed most efficiently is defined by the following properties:
Fields used in equality filters
Fields used in sort orders
Fields used in range and inequality filters (that are not already included in sort orders)
Fields used in aggregations (that aren't already included in sort orders and range and inequality filters)
Firestore Standard edition computes the results for queries as follows:
Identifies the index corresponding to the query's collection, filter properties, filter operators, and sort orders.
Identifies the index position from which the scanning starts. The start position is prefixed with the query's equality filters and ends with the range and inequality filters on the first orderBy field.
Starts scanning the index, returning each document that satisfies all the filters, until the scanning process does one of the following:
Encounters a document that doesn't meet the filter conditions and confirms that any subsequent document will never fully meet the filter conditions.
Reaches the end of the index.
Collects the maximum number of results requested by the query.
Indexing example
By automatically creating single-field indexes for you, Firestore Standard edition
allows your application to quickly support the most basic database queries.
Single-field indexes allow you to perform simple queries based on field values
and the comparators < , <= , == , >= , > , and in . For array fields, they allow
you to perform array-contains and array-contains-any queries.
To illustrate, examine the following examples from the point of view of
index creation. The following snippet creates a
few city documents in a cities collection and sets name , state ,
country , capital , population , and tags fields for each document:
Web
var citiesRef = db . collection ( "cities" );
citiesRef . doc ( "SF" ). set ({
name : "San Francisco" , state : "CA" , country : "USA" ,
capital : false , population : 860000 ,
regions : [ "west_coast" , "norcal" ] });
citiesRef . doc ( "LA" ). set ({
name : "Los Angeles" , state : "CA" , country : "USA" ,
capital : false , population : 3900000 ,
regions : [ "west_coast" , "socal" ] });
citiesRef . doc ( "DC" ). set ({
name : "Washington, D.C." , state : null , country : "USA" ,
capital : true , population : 680000 ,
regions : [ "east_coast" ] });
citiesRef . doc ( "TOK" ). set ({
name : "Tokyo" , state : null , country : "Japan" ,
capital : true , population : 9000000 ,
regions : [ "kanto" , "honshu" ] });
citiesRef . doc ( "BJ" ). set ({
name : "Beijing" , state : null , country : "China" ,
capital : true , population : 21500000 ,
regions : [ "jingjinji" , "hebei" ] }); test . firestore . js
Assuming the default automatic indexing settings, Firestore Standard edition updates
one ascending single-field index per field, one descending single-
field index per field, and one array-contains single-field index for
the array field. Each row in the following table represents an entry in a
single-field index:
Collection
Field indexed
Query scope
cities
arrow_upward name
Collection
cities
arrow_upward state
Collection
cities
arrow_upward country
Collection
cities
arrow_upward capital
Collection
cities
arrow_upward population
Collection
cities
arrow_upward regions
Collection
cities
arrow_downward name
Collection
cities
arrow_downward state
Collection
cities
arrow_downward country
Collection
cities
arrow_downward capital
Collection
cities
arrow_downward population
Collection
cities
arrow_downward regions
Collection
cities
array-contains regions
Collection
Queries supported by single-field indexes
Using these automatically created single-field indexes, you can run simple
queries like the following:
Web
const stateQuery = citiesRef . where ( "state" , "==" , "CA" );
const populationQuery = citiesRef . where ( "population" , "<" , 100000 );
const nameQuery = citiesRef . where ( "name" , ">=" , "San Francisco" ); test . firestore . js
You can also create in and compound equality ( == ) queries:
Web
citiesRef.where('country', 'in', ["USA", "Japan", "China"])
// Compound equality queries
citiesRef.where("state", "==", "CO").where("name", "==", "Denver")
citiesRef.where("country", "==", "USA")
.where("capital", "==", false)
.where("state", "==", "CA")
.where("population", "==", 860000)
If you need to run a compound query that uses a range comparison ( < , <= ,
> , or >= ) or if you need to sort by a different field, you must create a
manual index for that query.
The array-contains index allows you to query the regions array field:
Web
citiesRef . where ( "regions" , "array-contains" , "west_coast" )
// array-contains-any and array-contains use the same indexes
citiesRef . where ( "regions" , "array-contains-any" , [ "west_coast" , "east_coast" ])
Queries supported by manual indexes
Create manual indexes to support
compound queries not already supported by automatic single-field indexes.
For example, you would need a manual index for the following queries:
Web
citiesRef.where("country", "==", "USA").orderBy("population", "asc")
citiesRef.where("country", "==", "USA").where("population", " ", 690000)
// in and == clauses use the same index
citiesRef.where("country", "in", ["USA", "Japan", "China"])
.where("population", ">", 690000)
These queries require the following index. Since the query uses
an equality ( == or in ) for the country field, you can use
an ascending or descending index mode for this field. By default,
inequality clauses apply an ascending sort order based on the field in the
inequality clause.
Collection
Fields indexed
Query scope
cities
arrow_upward (or arrow_downward ) country, arrow_upward population
Collection
To run the same queries but with a descending sort order, you
need an additional index in the descending direction for population :
Web
citiesRef.where("country", "==", "USA").orderBy("population", "desc")
citiesRef.where("country", "==", "USA")
.where("population", " ", 690000)
.orderBy("population", "desc")
citiesRef.where("country", "in", ["USA", "Japan", "China"])
.where("population", ">", 690000)
.orderBy("population", "desc")
Collection
Fields indexed
Query scope
cities
arrow_upward country, arrow_upward population
Collection
cities
arrow_upward country , arrow_downward population
Collection
To avoid performance loss caused by index merging , we recommend that you create
an index to combine an array-contains or array-contains-any query
with additional clauses:
Web
citiesRef . where ( "regions" , "array-contains" , "east_coast" )
. where ( "capital" , "==" , true )
// array-contains-any and array-contains use the same index
citiesRef . where ( "regions" , "array-contains-any" , [ "west_coast" , "east_coast" ])
. where ( "capital" , "==" , true )
Collection
Fields indexed
Query scope
cities
array-contains tags, arrow_upward (or arrow_downward ) capital
Collection
Queries supported by collection group indexes
To demonstrate an index with collection group scope, add a
landmarks sub-collection to some of the city documents:
Web
var citiesRef = db . collection ( "cities" );
citiesRef . doc ( "SF" ) . collection ( "landmarks" ) . doc () . set ({
name : "Golden Gate Bridge" ,
category : "bridge" });
citiesRef . doc ( "SF" ) . collection ( "landmarks" ) . doc () . set ({
name : "Golden Gate Park" ,
category : "park" });
citiesRef . doc ( "DC" ) . collection ( "landmarks" ) . doc () . set ({
name : "National Gallery of Art" ,
category : "museum" });
citiesRef . doc ( "DC" ) . collection ( "landmarks" ) . doc () . set ({
name : "National Mall" ,
category : "park" });
Using the following single-field index with collection scope, you can query
a single city's landmarks collection based on the category field:
Collection
Fields indexed
Query scope
landmarks
arrow_upward (or arrow_downward ) category
Collection
Web
citiesRef.doc("SF").collection("landmarks").where("category", "==", "park")
citiesRef.doc("SF").collection("landmarks").where("category", "in", ["park", "museum"])
If you're interested in querying the landmarks across all cities, for example,
you run this query on the collection group that consists of all landmarks
collections. You must also enable a landmarks single-field index with
collection group scope:
Collection
Fields indexed
Query scope
landmarks
arrow_upward (or arrow_downward ) category
Collection group
With this index enabled, you can query the landmarks collection group:
Web
var landmarksGroupRef = db . collectionGroup ( "landmarks" );
landmarksGroupRef . where ( "category" , "==" , "park" )
landmarksGroupRef . where ( "category" , "in" , [ "park" , "museum" ])
To run a collection group query that returns filtered
or ordered results, you must enable a corresponding
index with collection group scope. Collection group queries that don't filter
or order results, however, don't require any additional index definitions.
For example, you can run the following collection group query without enabling
an additional index:
Web
db.collectionGroup("landmarks").get()
Index entries
Your project's configured indexes and the structure of a document determine
the number of index entries for a document. Index entries count towards
the index entry count limit .
The following example demonstrates the index entries of a document.
Document
/cities/SF
city_name : "San Francisco"
temperatures : {summer: 67, winter: 55}
neighborhoods : ["Mission", "Downtown", "Marina"]
Automatic indexes
city_name ASC
city_name DESC
neighborhoods ASC
neighborhoods DESC
temperatures ASC
temperatures DESC
temperatures.summer ASC
temperatures.summer DESC
temperatures.winter ASC
temperatures.winter DESC
neighborhoods Array Contains
Manual indexes
city_name ASC, neighborhoods ARRAY
city_name DESC, neighborhoods ARRAY
Index entries
This indexing configuration results in the following index entries for the
document:
Index

Automatic index entries
city_name ASC
city_name: "San Francisco"
city_name DESC
city_name: "San Francisco"
neighborhoods ASC

temperatures.winter DESC
temperatures.winter: 55
neighborhoods Array Contains
neighborhoods: "Mission"
neighborhoods Array Contains
neighborhoods: "Downtown"
neighborhoods Array Contains
neighborhoods: "Marina"
Manual index entries
city_name ASC, neighborhoods ARRAY
city_name: "San Francisco", neighborhoods: "Mission"
city_name ASC, neighborhoods ARRAY
city_name: "San Francisco", neighborhoods: "Downtown"
city_name ASC, neighborhoods ARRAY
city_name: "San Francisco", neighborhoods: "Marina"
city_name DESC, neighborhoods ARRAY
city_name: "San Francisco", neighborhoods: "Mission"
city_name DESC, neighborhoods ARRAY
city_name: "San Francisco", neighborhoods: "Downtown"
city_name DESC, neighborhoods ARRAY
city_name: "San Francisco", neighborhoods: "Marina"
Indexes and pricing
Indexes contribute to the storage costs of your application.
For more information about how to calculate storage size for indexes, see
Index entry size .
Use index merging
Although Firestore Standard edition uses an index for every query, it doesn't
necessarily require one index per query. For queries with multiple equality
( == ) clauses and, optionally, an orderBy clause, Firestore Standard edition can
re-use existing indexes. Firestore Standard edition can merge the indexes for simple
equality filters to build the indexes needed for larger equality
queries.
You can reduce indexing costs by identifying situations where you can use index
merging. For example, in a restaurants collection for a restaurant rating app:
collections_bookmark restaurants
class burgerthyme
name : "Burger Thyme"
category : "burgers"
city : "San Francisco"
editors_pick : true
star_rating : 4
This app uses queries like the following. The app uses combinations of equality
clauses for category , city , and editors_pick while always sorting by
ascending star_rating :
Web
db.collection("restaurants").where("category", "==", "burgers")
.orderBy("star_rating")
db.collection("restaurants").where("city", "==", "San Francisco")
.orderBy("star_rating")
db.collection("restaurants").where("category", "==", "burgers")
.where("city", "==", "San Francisco")
.orderBy("star_rating")
db.collection("restaurants").where("category", "==", "burgers")
.where("city", "==" "San Francisco")
.where("editors_pick", "==", true )
.orderBy("star_rating")
You could create an index for each query:
Collection
Fields indexed
Query scope
restaurants
arrow_upward category, arrow_upward star_rating
Collection
restaurants
arrow_upward city, arrow_upward star_rating
Collection
restaurants
arrow_upward category, arrow_upward city, arrow_upward star_rating
Collection
restaurants
arrow_upward category, arrow_upward city, arrow_upward editors_pick, arrow_upward star_rating
Collection
As a better solution, you can reduce the number
of indexes by taking advantage of Firestore Standard edition's ability to merge
indexes for equality clauses:
Collection
Fields indexed
Query scope
restaurants
arrow_upward category, arrow_upward star_rating
Collection
restaurants
arrow_upward city, arrow_upward star_rating
Collection
restaurants
arrow_upward editors_pick, arrow_upward star_rating
Collection
Not only is this set of indexes smaller, it also supports an additional query:
Web
db.collection("restaurants").where("editors_pick", "==", true)
.orderBy("star_rating")
Indexing limits
The following limits apply to indexes. For more information about quotas and limits, see
Quotas and Limits .
This page identifies the request quotas and limits for Firestore Standard edition.

Maximum size of an indexed field value
1500 bytes
Field values over 1500 bytes are truncated. Queries involving
truncated field values may return inconsistent results.
Indexing best practices
For most apps, you can rely on automatic indexing and the error message links to
manage your indexes. However, you may want to add automatic indexing exemptions in the
following cases:
Case
Description
Large string fields
If you have a string field that often holds long string values that
you don't use for querying, you can cut storage costs by exempting the field
from indexing.
High write rates to a collection containing documents with sequential values
If you index a field that increases or decreases sequentially between
documents in a collection, like a timestamp, then the maximum write rate to the
collection is 500 writes per second. If you don't query based on the field with sequential values, you can exempt the field
from indexing to bypass this limit.
In an IoT use case with a high write rate, for example, a collection containing documents with a timestamp field might approach the 500 writes per second limit.
TTL fields
If you use TTL (time-to-live) policies , note that the TTL
field must be a timestamp. Indexing on TTL fields is enabled by default and can
affect performance at higher traffic rates. As a best practice, add
automatic indexing exemptions for your TTL fields.
Large array or map fields
Large array or map fields can approach the limit of 40,000 index entries per document. If you are not querying based on a large array or map field, you should exempt it from indexing.
If you are using queries with range and inequality operators on multiple fields, see the indexing
considerations that you should consider to optimize the
performance and cost of Firestore Standard edition queries
