Bulk delete data
Use the managed bulk delete service to delete data from your database. This
feature supports deletion against one or more collection groups.
This page describes how to delete documents in bulk using
the managed bulk delete service. The
Firestore managed bulk delete service is available through
the gcloud
command-line tool and the Firestore REST API .
Caution: Bulk deleting data from Firestore incurs one delete
operation per document deleted and some read operations based on a fraction of total documents read.
However, these operations don't appear in the usage section of the console. Make sure that you understand this before issuing bulk deletes to avoid billed charges.
Before you begin
Before you can use the managed bulk delete service, you must complete the
following tasks:
Enable
billing for your Google Cloud project. Only Google Cloud
projects with billing enabled can use the bulk delete functionality.
Make sure your account has the necessary permissions for
Firestore. If you are the project owner,
your account has the required permissions. Otherwise, the following
roles grant the necessary permissions for bulk delete operations:
Firestore roles:
Owner , Cloud Datastore Owner , or Cloud Datastore Bulk Admin
Note: These Datastore roles also grant
permissions in Firestore.
Set up gcloud for your project
You can initiate bulk delete operations through the Google Cloud console or
the gcloud command-line tool. To use gcloud , set up the command-line tool
and connect to your project in one of the following ways:
Access gcloud from the Google Cloud console using Cloud Shell .
Start Cloud Shell
Make sure gcloud is configured for the correct project:
gcloud config set project [ PROJECT_ID ]
Install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK.
Bulk delete data
A bulk delete operation first finds all applicable documents in your database and deletes them in batches. You may still query or read these documents while the results may vary based on the progress made. Bulk delete doesn't delete any documents added or modified after the operation starts.
Note: If you plan to delete all documents in the database, see the database deletion feature instead.
Bulk delete specific collection groups
gcloud
To bulk delete specific collection groups, use the
--collection-ids flag. The operation deletes only
the collection groups with the given IDs.
Note: Bulk deleting a collection won't automatically delete all the child collections. You also need to specify the child collection groups.
gcloud firestore bulk-delete \
--collection-ids= [COLLECTION_GROUP_ID_1_OR_KIND_1] , [COLLECTION_GROUP_ID_2_OR_KIND_2] , [SUBCOLLECTION_GROUP_ID_1_OR_KIND_3] \
--database= [DATABASE]
Manage bulk delete operations
After you start a bulk delete operation, Firestore assigns
the operation a unique name. You can use the operation name to delete,
cancel, or check the status of the operation.
Operation names are prefixed with projects/[PROJECT_ID]/databases/[DATABASE_ID]/operations/ ,
for example:
projects/my-project/databases/(default)/operations/ASA1MTAwNDQxNAgadGx1YWZlZAcSeWx0aGdpbi1zYm9qLW5pbWRhEgopEg
However, you can leave out the prefix when specifying an operation name for
the describe , cancel , and delete commands.
List all bulk delete operations
gcloud
Use the operations list command to see all running and recently completed operations, including bulk delete operations:
gcloud firestore operations list
Check operation status
gcloud
Use the operations describe command to show the status of a bulk delete operation.
gcloud firestore operations describe [OPERATION_NAME]
Estimate the completion time
A request for the status of a long-running operation returns the metrics
workEstimated and workCompleted . Each of these metrics is returned in both
number of bytes and number of documents:
workEstimated shows the estimated total number of bytes and documents an
operation will process. Firestore might omit this metric if it
can't make an estimate.
workCompleted shows the number of bytes and documents deleted so far.
After the operation completes, the value shows the total number of
bytes and documents that were actually processed, which might be larger than the
value of workEstimated .
Divide workCompleted by workEstimated for a rough progress estimate. This
estimate might be inaccurate, because it depends on delayed statistics
collection.
Cancel an operation
gcloud
Use the operations cancel command to stop an operation in progress:
gcloud firestore operations cancel [OPERATION_NAME]
Cancelling a running operation doesn't undo the operation. A cancelled bulk delete
operation doesn't recover the deleted documents.
Delete an operation
Use the gcloud firestore operations delete command to remove
a completed operation from the list of recent operations. To cancel a running operation, use the earlier cancellation operation.
gcloud firestore operations delete [OPERATION_NAME]
Billing and pricing for bulk delete operations
You are required to enable billing for your Google Cloud project before you use
the managed bulk delete service.
Bulk delete operations are charged
for document reads and deletes at the rates listed in
Firestore pricing .
Bulk delete operations incur one index entry read per document found and one
delete operation per document deleted. You are charged one read operation
for up to 1000 index entries read. For example, for a bulk delete operation
that deleted 1500 documents, you will be charged with 2 documents reads and 1500 document deletes.
Note that Firestore charges on the actual work done. If the
operation is cancelled or failed due to user error, you will be charged with
progress made. Firestore won't charge reads or deletes for the
documents that are not eventually deleted, such as documents that
are modified after the delete operation started. The cost will be attributed on
the day of operation completion.
Bulk delete operations doesn't trigger your
Google Cloud budget alerts until after completion. Similarly,
reads and deletes performed during a bulk delete operation are applied to
your free tier usage after the operation is complete. Bulk delete
operations don't affect the usage shown in the usage section of the console.
View bulk delete costs
Bulk delete operations apply the goog-firestoremanaged:bulkdelete
label to billed operations. In the Cloud Billing reports page ,
you can use this label to view costs related to bulk delete operations.
Best practices
Avoid skipping over deleted data which might slow down the queries.
