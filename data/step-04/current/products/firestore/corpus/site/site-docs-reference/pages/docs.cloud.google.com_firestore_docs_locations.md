Locations
When you provision a Firestore instance, you must choose a
location for the instance. To reduce latency and increase availability, store
your data close to the users and services that need it.
You can optionally
create multiple databases in your project,
each with its own location setting.
Be aware that once you provision a database instance, you cannot change its
location setting.
Important : The location setting for your
default Firestore database instance has a
dependency on the "location of default Google Cloud resources" .
This means that when you provision your
default Firestore database, its location might have already been
set, either during project creation or when setting up another service that
shares this location dependency.
Any non-default Firestore database
instances in your project do not share this location dependency.
Types of locations
You can store your Firestore data in a
multi-region location or a regional location .
Multi-region locations
Select a multi-region location to maximize the availability and
durability of your database.
A multi-region location consists of a defined set of
regions where multiple replicas of the database
are stored. Each replica is either a read-write replica which contains all of the
data in the database or a witness replica which does not maintain a full set of
data but participates in replication.
By replicating the data between multiple regions, data
can continue to be served even with the loss of an entire
region. Within a region, data is replicated across
zones so that data can continue to be served
within that region even with the loss of a zone.
Firestore supports the following multi-region locations:

Note: If your project already has an App Engine app with a location
of either us-central or europe-west , then your default
Firestore database will be considered
multi-regional .
Regional locations
A regional location is a specific geographic place, such as South Carolina. Data
in a regional location is replicated in multiple zones within a
region .
Select a regional location for lower costs, for lower write latency if your
application is sensitive to latency, or for
co-location with other Google Cloud resources .
Firestore supports the following regional resource locations:

Location SLA
Your Firestore location type determines the
Service Level Agreement (SLA)
uptime percentage:
Covered service
Monthly uptime percentage
Firestore Multi-Region
>= 99.999%
Firestore Regional
>= 99.99%
Location pricing
Your Firestore location determines the cost of database
operations.
For a comprehensive explanation of pricing per region and per region type,
see:
Firestore Standard edition pricing
Firestore Enterprise edition pricing
View the location of your databases
Use one of the following methods to view the location setting for your databases:
Run the gcloud firestore databases list command.
Open the
database list in the Google Cloud console.
The location for each database is in the location column.
In the Firebase console, go to the
Firestore Data tab
to view the list of your database instances and their locations.
Possible location dependencies due to "location for default Google Cloud resources"
The "location for default Google Cloud resources" is the location setting
for any project resources associated with Google App Engine, including the
following:
default Firestore database instance
default Cloud Storage for Firebase bucket with the name format of
*.appspot.com
Google Cloud Scheduler used specifically with 1st gen scheduled functions
Note: None of the other resources in your project share this location
dependency, including the following: Realtime Database instances,
non-default Firestore instances, non-default Cloud Storage buckets,
default Cloud Storage buckets with the name format of
*.firebasestorage.app , non-scheduled functions,
and 2nd gen scheduled functions.
This "location for default Google Cloud resources" is an immutable
setting. Also, when you set the location for one of the associated resources,
you indirectly set the location for all of them due to their common association
with App Engine.
However, with many changes to the Firebase and Google Cloud ecosystem over
the years, the associations of resources to App Engine have been
changing. Most notably, starting
October 30, 2024 , all newly provisioned
default Cloud Storage for Firebase buckets have the name format
*.firebasestorage.app , and they are not associated
with App Engine.
Key Point: Starting October 30, 2024 ,
provisioning the default Cloud Storage for Firebase bucket does not set the
"location for default Google Cloud resources" (like the location for the
project's default Firestore instance). Also, provisioning the
default Firestore instance no longer sets the location for a new
default Cloud Storage for Firebase bucket (with name format of
*.firebasestorage.app ).
Here are the details of what changed in the possible location dependencies :
Starting October 30, 2024 , if the
default Firestore instance and the
default Cloud Storage for Firebase bucket are not yet provisioned:
Provisioning the default Firestore instance sets the location
for any future App Engine app provisioned in the project.
However, it does not dictate the location of the future
default Cloud Storage bucket.
Provisioning the default Cloud Storage bucket no longer provisions
an App Engine app. Thus, the location of the
default Cloud Storage bucket does not dictate the location of the
future default Firestore instance.
Starting October 30, 2024 , if the default
Firestore instance has already been provisioned, but the
default Cloud Storage for Firebase bucket has not been provisioned:
The existing default Firestore instance does not dictate the
location of the future default Cloud Storage bucket
( *.firebasestorage.app ).
Starting October 30, 2024 , if the
default Cloud Storage for Firebase bucket has already been
provisioned (specifically, the
*.appspot.com bucket) , but the
default Firestore instance has not been provisioned:
Back when the default Cloud Storage bucket
( *.appspot.com ) was provisioned,
an App Engine app was also provisioned, and thus the location
of the future default Firestore instance was set at that time.
Even if you delete the *.appspot.com bucket, you
can't delete the App Engine app, so the location setting of the
future default Firestore instance is already set.
If you used 1st gen scheduled functions , then their location is set to the
location for default Google Cloud resources. This is because
Cloud Scheduler and App Engine previously had an association with
each other. Also, if you set up 1st gen scheduled functions before
provisioning other resources that shared this location setting, then you set
their location, too.
Note that if you have an App Engine app with a
location of either us-central or europe-west , then your
location for default Google Cloud resources is considered
multi-regional .
