Manage Standard edition indexes
Indexing behavior depends on the edition of the database. This page
describes how to manage your indexes for Firestore Standard edition. For Firestore Enterprise edition,
see Firestore Enterprise edition index overview .
Firestore Standard edition ensures query performance by requiring an index for every
query. The indexes required for the most basic queries are automatically
created for you. As you use and test your app,
Firestore Standard edition generates error messages that help you create additional indexes
that your app requires. This page describes how to manage your
automatic , manual , and vector indexes.
Create a missing index through an error message
If you attempt a
compound query with a range clause that doesn't map to an existing index,
you receive an error. The error message includes a direct link to create the
missing index in the Firebase console.
Note: You can manage Firestore Standard edition through the Firebase console or the
Google Cloud console, but these links will always open in the Firebase console.
Follow the generated link to the Firebase console, review the automatically
populated info, and click Create .
Note: For non-array and non-map fields, you must select ascending or
descending ordering, even if you don't need the field for
ordering. Your choice doesn't impact the behavior of equalities in the query.
In the case that a vector index is required, the error message will include a
Google Cloud CLI command to create the missing vector index. Run the command to
create the missing index.
Roles and permissions
Before you can create an index in Firestore Standard edition, make sure that you are assigned either of the following roles:
Note: The following roles are managed through Identity and Access Management (IAM). For more information about roles and associated permissions, see Predefined roles .
roles/datastore.owner
roles/datastore.indexAdmin
roles/editor
roles/owner
If you have defined custom roles, assign all of the following permissions to create indexes:
datastore.indexes.create
datastore.indexes.delete
datastore.indexes.get
datastore.indexes.list
datastore.indexes.update
Use the Google Cloud console
From the Google Cloud console, you can manage automatic indexing
exemptions and manual indexes.
Create a manual index
To manually create a new index from the Google Cloud console:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Select the required database from the list of databases.
In the navigation menu, click Indexes , and then click the Manual tab.
Click Create Index .
To index a vector field for vector searches, select Create vector index .
Otherwise, select Create index .
Enter a Collection ID . Add the names of the fields you want to index
and an index mode for each field.
For vector indexes, enter a vector field path and the number of vector embedding dimensions.
Click Save Index .
Your new index will show up in the list of manual indexes and
Firestore Standard edition will begin creating your index. When your index is done
creating, you will see a green check mark next to the index.
Delete a manual index
To delete a manual index:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Select the required database from the list of databases.
In the navigation menu, click Indexes , and then click the Manual tab.
In the list of your manual indexes, click the More button more_vert for the index you want to delete. Click Delete .
Confirm that you want to delete this index by clicking Delete Index from the alert.
Add an automatic index exemption
Automatic indexing exemptions allow you to override automatic index
settings for specific fields in a collection. You can
add an automatic indexing exemption from the console:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Select the required database from the list of databases.
In the navigation menu, click Indexes , and then click the Automatic tab.
Click Add Exemption .
Enter a Collection ID and Field path.
Select new indexing settings for this field. Enable or disable automatically
updated ascending, descending, and array-contains single-field indexes for
this field.
Click Save Exemption .
Add a collection-level exemption
To define a single-field index exemption that applies to all fields under a
collection ID:
Click Add Exemption .
Enter a Collection ID for the collection group and set Field path as * .
Select the indexing exemptions you want to apply for all fields in the collection group.
Click Save Exemption .
Delete an automatic indexing exemption
To delete a automatic indexing exemption, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
Select the required database from the list of databases.
In the navigation menu, click Indexes , and then click the Automatic tab.
In the list of your single-field index exemptions, click the More button more_vert for the exemption you want to delete. Click Delete .
Confirm that you want to delete this exemption by clicking Delete from the alert.
When you delete an automatic indexing exemption, the specified field or sub-field will
use inherited indexing settings. Document fields revert to your database's
automatic index settings. Sub-fields in a map inherit any exemptions on parent
fields before inheriting automatic index settings.
Use the Firebase CLI
You can also deploy indexes with the Firebase CLI .
To get started, run firebase init firestore in your project directory.
During setup, the Firebase CLI generates a JSON file with the default
indexes in the correct format. Edit the file to add more indexes and deploy it
with the firebase deploy command.
To deploy Firestore Standard edition indexes and rules only, add the
--only firestore flag.
If you make edits to the indexes using the Firebase console, make
sure you also update your local indexes file. Refer to
the JSON index definition reference .
Use Terraform
Creating indexes in the database
Firestore Standard edition databases can include both single-field (automatic) and composite (manual) indexes. You can edit the Terraform configuration file to create an index for your database. Automatic and manual indexes use distinct Terraform resource types
( google_firestore_index
and google_firestore_field ).
Both Native mode and Datastore mode indexes are supported.
Single-field (automatic) index
The following example Terraform configuration file creates a single-field index on the name field in the chatrooms collection:
firestore.tf
resource "random_id" "variable"{
byte_length = 8
}
resource "google_firestore_field" "single-index" {
project = " project-id "
database = " database-id "
collection = "chatrooms_${random_id.variable.hex}"
field = "name"
index_config {
indexes {
order = "ASCENDING"
query_scope = "COLLECTION_GROUP"
}
indexes {
array_config = "CONTAINS"
}
}
ttl_config {}
}
Replace project-id with your project ID. Project IDs must be unique.
Replace database-id with your database ID.
Composite (manual) index
The following example Terraform configuration file creates a composite index for a combination of the name field and the description field in the chatrooms collection:
firestore.tf
resource "google_firestore_index" "composite-index" {
project = " project-id "
database = " database-id "
collection = "chatrooms"
fields {
field_path = "name"
order = "ASCENDING"
}
fields {
field_path = "description"
order = "DESCENDING"
}
}
Replace project-id with your project ID. Project IDs must be unique.
Replace database-id with your database ID.
Vector index
The following example Terraform configuration file creates a vector index on the embedding field in the chatrooms collection:
firestore.tf
resource "google_firestore_index" "vector-index" {
project = "project-id"
database = "database-id"
collection = "chatrooms"
fields {
field_path = "__name__"
order = "ASCENDING"
}
fields {
field_path = "embedding"
vector_config {
dimension = 128
flat {}
}
}
}
Replace project-id with your project ID. Project IDs must be unique.
Replace database-id with your database ID.
Datastore mode indexes
You can also create Datastore Mode indexes using Terraform.
datastore.tf
resource "google_firestore_index" "datastore-mode-index" {
project = " project-id "
database = " database-id "
collection = "chatrooms"
fields {
field_path = "name"
order = "ASCENDING"
}
fields {
field_path = "description"
order = "DESCENDING"
}
query_scope = "COLLECTION_GROUP"
api_scope = "DATASTORE_MODE_API"
}
Migrate from google_datastore_index
The google_datastore_index resource is deprecated and will be unavailable in terraform-provider-google version 6.0.0 and later.
If you were previously using the google_datastore_index resource, you can migrate to google_firestore_index .
You can migrate by doing the following:
Write an equivalent google_firestore_index resource.
Import your existing Datastore mode index into the new resource.
Remove references to the old google_datastore_index resource.
Remove the old google_datastore_index resource from Terraform's state.
Running terraform apply to apply any changes.
More detailed instructions follow:
Write a replacement google_firestore_index based on your existing google_datastore_index resource. See below for the required changes.
Determine the Firestore resource path of your index:
export INDEX_RESOURCE_PATH = $( echo '"projects/${google_datastore_index. datastore-index-resource-name .project}/databases/(default)/collectionGroups/${google_datastore_index. datastore-index-resource-name .kind}/indexes/${google_datastore_index. datastore-index-resource-name .index_id}"' | terraform console | tr -d '"' )
Replace datastore-index-resource-name with the Terraform name of your existing resource.
Import your existing Datastore mode index to the google_firestore_index resource you created above:
terraform import google_firestore_index. firestore-index-resource-name $INDEX_RESOURCE_PATH
Replace firestore-index-resource-name with the Terraform name of your existing resource.
For more information on importing Firestore index resources, see the google_firestore_index reference documentation .
Delete the existing google_datastore_index resource from your Terraform configuration file.
Remove the existing google_datastore_index resource from Terraform state:
terraform state rm google_datastore_index. datastore-index-resource-name
For more information on removing resources,
see the Terraform page on Removing Resources .
Run terraform plan . Verify the output to confirm that you are neither creating nor destroying any resources.
Inspect the output to ensure the import completed successfully. If the output shows any fields changing, ensure these changes are intended. If the output includes a line similar to:
google_firestore_index. firestore-index-resource-name must be replaced
then inspect your Terraform configuration file to see if there were any mistakes.
Warning: Do not run terraform apply if you see any index resources requiring replacement or any index resources being deleted. Doing so may cause the loss of your index, possibly resulting in downtime for your application.
Once you are satisfied with the Terraform plan output, run:
terraform apply
Translate your index
To translate a google_datastore_index resource to the equivalent google_firestore_index resource, copy it and make the following changes:
Replace google_datastore_index with google_firestore_index .
Replace the argument name kind with collection , but keep the argument value the same.
Replace the argument name ancestor with query_scope . Replace the argument value ALL_ANCESTORS with COLLECTION_RECURSIVE and any other value with COLLECTION_GROUP . If there was no ancestor argument, add a query_scope argument with value COLLECTION_GROUP .
Add the argument api_scope with value DATASTORE_MODE_API .
For each instance of properties , replace it with a corresponding instance of fields . Replace each instance of name with field_path and each instance of direction with order .
For example, consider this google_datastore_index resource:
datastore.tf
resource "google_datastore_index" "legacy" {
kind = "foo"
properties {
name = "property_a"
direction = "ASCENDING"
}
properties {
name = "property_b"
direction = "ASCENDING"
}
}
The equivalent google_firestore_index resource would be:
resource "google_firestore_index" "new" {
// note: defaults to the provider project
project = project
// note: defaults to the (default) database
database = "(default)"
collection = "foo"
api_scope = "DATASTORE_MODE_API"
// since there was no "ancestor" property set above, use COLLECTION_GROUP here
query_scope = "COLLECTION_GROUP"
fields {
field_path = "property_a"
order = "ASCENDING"
}
fields {
field_path = "property_b"
order = "ASCENDING"
}
}
Index build time
To build an index, Firestore Standard edition must set up the index and then
backfill the index with existing data. Index build time is the sum of setup time
and backfill time:
Setting up an index takes a few minutes. The minimum build
time for an index is a few minutes, even for an empty database.
Backfill time depends on how much existing data belongs in the new index. The
more field values that match the index definition, the longer it takes to
backfill the index.
Index builds are long-running operations .
Key Term: Firestore Standard edition supports several administrative operations that
can take a long time to complete. These operations are called long-running
operations . Firestore Standard edition includes features to execute and manage long-
running operations. Supported long-running operations include index builds and
export operations.
After you start an index build, Firestore Standard edition assigns
the operation a unique name. Operation names are prefixed with projects/[PROJECT_ID]/databases/(default)/operations/ ,
for example:
projects/ project-id /databases/(default)/operations/ASA1MTAwNDQxNAgadGx1YWZlZAcSeWx0aGdpbi1zYm9qLW5pbWRhEgopEg
However, you can leave out the prefix when specifying an operation name for
the describe command.
Listing all long-running operations
To list long-running operations, use the
gcloud firestore operations list
command. This command lists ongoing and recently completed operations.
Operations are listed for a few days after completion:
gcloud firestore operations list
Check operation status
Instead of listing all long-running operations, you can list the details of
a single operation:
gcloud firestore operations describe operation-name
Estimating the completion time
As your operation runs, see the value of the state field
for the overall status of the operation.
A request for the status of a long-running operation also returns the metrics
workEstimated and workCompleted . These metrics are returned for the number
of documents. workEstimated shows the estimated total number of documents an
operation will process. workCompleted
shows the number of documents processed so far. After the operation completes,
workCompleted reflects the total number of documents that were
actually processed, which might be different than the value of workEstimated .
Divide workCompleted by workEstimated for a rough progress estimate. The
estimate might be inaccurate because it depends on delayed statistics
collection.
For example, here is the progress status of an index build:
{
"operations": [
{
"name": "projects/ project-id /operations/AyAyMDBiM2U5NTgwZDAtZGIyYi0zYjc0LTIzYWEtZjg1ZGdWFmZWQHEjF0c2Flc3UtcmV4ZWRuaS1uaW1kYRUKSBI",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.firestore.admin.v1.IndexOperationMetadata",
"common": {
"operationType": "CREATE_INDEX",
"startTime": "2020-06-23T16:52:25.697539Z",
"state": "PROCESSING"
},
"progressDocuments": {
"workCompleted": "219327",
"workEstimated": "2198182"
}
},
},
...
When an operation is done, the operation description will contain "done":
true . See the value of the state field for
the result of the operation. If the done field is not set in the response,
then its value is false . Do not depend on the existence of the done value
for in-progress operations.
Index building errors
You might encounter index building errors when managing manual indexes and
automatic index exemptions. An indexing operation can fail if
Firestore Standard edition encounters a problem with the data it's indexing. Most
commonly, this means you hit an
index limit . For
example, the operation may have reached the maximum number of index entries
per document.
If index creation fails, you see the error message in the console. After
you verify that you are not hitting any
index limits , re-try your index operation.
