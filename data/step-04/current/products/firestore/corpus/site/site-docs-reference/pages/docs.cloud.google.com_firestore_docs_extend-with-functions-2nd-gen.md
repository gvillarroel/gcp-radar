Extend Cloud Run with event triggers using Cloud Run functions
With Cloud Run functions, you can deploy code to handle events
triggered by changes in your Cloud Run database. This lets you add
server-side functionality without running your own servers.
Note: This feature is also available through
Cloud Functions for Firebase (2nd gen). To see examples that use the
Firebase SDK, see
Extend Cloud Run with Cloud Functions for Firebase (2nd gen) .
This guide describes how to create triggers for Cloud Run functions
from Firestore events.
You can trigger your Cloud Run functions from
events in a Firestore database. When triggered, your function reads and
updates a Firestore database in response to these events through the
Firestore APIs and client libraries .
The process of Firestore events triggering a
Cloud Run function consists of the following steps:
The service waits for changes to a particular document.
When a change occurs, the service is triggered and performs its tasks.
The service receives a data object with a snapshot of the affected document.
For write or update events, the data object contains snapshots
representing document state before and after the triggering event.
Before you begin
Make sure you have set up a new project for Cloud Run as described
in the setup page.
Enable the Artifact Registry, Cloud Build, Cloud Run Admin API,
Eventarc, Firestore Cloud Logging, and Pub/Sub
APIs:
Enable the APIs
Required roles
You or your administrator must grant the deployer account and the trigger
identity. Optionally, grant the Pub/Sub service agent the following
IAM roles.
Required roles for the deployer account
To get the permissions that
you need to trigger from Firestore events,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on your project:
Cloud Build Editor ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor )
Cloud Run Admin ( roles/run.admin )
Datastore Owner ( roles/datastore.owner )
Eventarc Admin ( roles/eventarc.admin )
Logs View Accessor ( roles/logging.viewAccessor )
Project IAM Admin ( roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin )
Service Account Admin ( roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin )
Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser )
Service Usage Admin ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Note that by default,
Cloud Build
permissions include permissions to upload and download Artifact Registry
artifacts .
Required roles for the trigger identity
Make note of the Compute Engine
default service account as you will you attach it to an Eventarc trigger to represent
the identity of the trigger for testing purposes. This service account is automatically created
after enabling or using a Google Cloud service that uses Compute Engine, and with the
following email format:
PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with your Google Cloud
project number. You can find your project number on the
Welcome
page of the Google Cloud console or by running the following command:
gcloud projects describe PROJECT_ID --format = 'value(projectNumber)'
For production environments, we strongly recommend
creating a new service account
and granting it one or more IAM roles that contain the
minimum permissions required
and follow the principle of least privilege .
Note:
The
iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts organization policy constraint
prevents the Editor role from being automatically granted to default service accounts. If you
created your organization after May 3, 2024, this constraint is enforced by
default.
We strongly recommend that you enforce this constraint to disable the automatic role grant. If you
disable the automatic role grant, you must decide which roles to grant to the default service
accounts, and then grant these roles
yourself.
If the default service account already has the Editor role, we recommend that you replace the
Editor role with less permissive roles.To safely modify the service account's roles, use Policy Simulator to see the impact of
the change, and then grant and revoke the
appropriate roles .
By default, Cloud Run services are only callable by Project
Owners, Project Editors, and Cloud Run Admins and Invokers.
You can
control
access on a per-service basis ; however, for testing purposes, grant the
Cloud Run
Invoker role ( run.invoker ) on the Google Cloud project to the
Compute Engine service account. This grants the role on all
Cloud Run services and jobs in a project.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/run.invoker
Note that if you create a trigger for an authenticated
Cloud Run service without granting the Cloud Run
Invoker role, the trigger is created successfully and is active. However, the
trigger will not work as expected and a message similar to the following appears
in the logs:
The request was not authenticated. Either allow
unauthenticated invocations or set the proper Authorization header.
Grant the
Eventarc
Event Receiver role ( roles/eventarc.eventReceiver ) on the
project to the Compute Engine default service account so that
the Eventarc trigger can receive events from event providers.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount: PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/eventarc.eventReceiver
Optional role for the Pub/Sub service agent
If you enabled the Cloud Pub/Sub service agent on or before April
8, 2021, to support authenticated Pub/Sub push requests, grant
the Service
Account Token Creator role ( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator )
to the service agent. Otherwise, this role is granted by default:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member = serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
Set up your Firestore database
Before you deploy your service, you must create a Firestore database:
Go to the Firestore page .
Select Create a Firestore database .
In the Name your database field, enter a Database ID , such as
firestore-db .
In the Configuration options section, Firestore native is
selected by default along with the applicable security rules.
In Location type , select Region and choose the region for where your
database is to reside. This choice is permanent.
Click Create database .
The Firestore data model consists of
collections that contain documents. A document contains a set of key-value pairs.
Write a Firestore-triggered function
To write a function that responds to Firestore events, prepare to specify
the following during deployment:
a trigger event type
a trigger event filter to select the documents associated with the function
the function code to run
Event types
Firestore supports create , update , delete , and write events. The
write event encompasses all modifications to a document.
Event type
Trigger
google.cloud.firestore.document.v1.created (default)
Triggered when a document is written to for the first time.
google.cloud.firestore.document.v1.updated
Triggered when a document already exists and has any value changed.
google.cloud.firestore.document.v1.deleted
Triggered when a document with data is deleted.
google.cloud.firestore.document.v1.written
Triggered when a document is created, updated or deleted.
google.cloud.firestore.document.v1.created.withAuthContext
Same as created but adds authentication information.
google.cloud.firestore.document.v1.updated.withAuthContext
Same as updated but adds authentication information.
google.cloud.firestore.document.v1.deleted.withAuthContext
Same as deleted but adds authentication information.
google.cloud.firestore.document.v1.written.withAuthContext
Same as written but adds authentication information.
Note: You set triggers at the document level. It is not possible to create a
trigger activated by changes to a specific field or
collection.
Wildcards are written in triggers using curly braces, for example:
projects/ YOUR_PROJECT_ID /databases/(default)/documents/collection/{document_wildcard}
Trigger event filters
To trigger your service, specify a document path to listen to. The document
path must be in the same Google Cloud project as the service.
Here are a few examples of valid document paths:
users/marie : Monitors a single document, /users/marie .
users/{username} : Monitors all user documents. Wildcards are
used to monitor all documents in the collection.
users/{username}/addresses/home : Monitors the home address
document for all users.
users/{username}/addresses/{addressId} : Monitors all address
documents.
users/{user=**} : Monitors all user documents and any
documents in subcollections under each user document such as
/users/userID/address/home or /users/userID/phone/work .
users/{username}/addresses : invalid address path. Refers to the
subcollection addresses , not a document.
Wildcards and parameters
If you don't know the specific document you want to monitor, use a {wildcard}
instead of the document ID:
users/{username} listens for changes to all user documents.
In this example, when any field on any document in users is changed, it
matches a wildcard called {username} .
If a document in users has
subcollections , and a
field in one of those subcollections' documents is changed, the {username}
wildcard is not triggered. If your goal is to respond to events in
subcollections also, use the multi-segment wildcard {username=**} .
Wildcard matches are extracted from document paths. You can define as many
wildcards as you like to substitute explicit collection or document IDs. You can
use up to one multi-segment wildcard like {username=**} .
Function code
See examples for how to use Firestore in Native Mode events to trigger a
Cloud Run function.
Include the proto dependencies in your source
You must include the Cloud Run data.proto
file in the source directory for your function. This file imports the following
protos which you must also include in your source directory:
google/protobuf/struct.proto
google/protobuf/timestamp.proto
google/type/latlng.proto
Use the same directory structure for the dependencies. For example, place
struct.proto within google/protobuf .
These files are required to decode event data. If your function source does
not include these files, it returns an error when it runs.
Event attributes
Each event includes data attributes
that include information about the event such as the time the event triggered.
Cloud Run adds additional data about the database and document
involved in the event. You can access these attributes as follows:
Java
logger . info ( "Function triggered by event on: " + event . getSource ());
logger . info ( "Event type: " + event . getType ());
logger . info ( "Event time " + event . getTime ());
logger . info ( "Event project: " + event . getExtension ( "project" ));
logger . info ( "Event location: " + event . getExtension ( "location" ));
logger . info ( "Database name: " + event . getExtension ( "database" ));
logger . info ( "Database document: " + event . getExtension ( "document" ));
// For withAuthContext events
logger . info ( "Auth information: " + event . getExtension ( "authid" ));
logger . info ( "Auth information: " + event . getExtension ( "authtype" ));
Node.js
console . log ( `Function triggered by event on: ${ cloudEvent . source } ` );
console . log ( `Event type: ${ cloudEvent . type } ` );
console . log ( `Event time: ${ cloudEvent . time } ` );
console . log ( `Event project: ${ cloudEvent . project } ` );
console . log ( `Event location: ${ cloudEvent . location } ` );
console . log ( `Database name: ${ cloudEvent . database } ` );
console . log ( `Document name: ${ cloudEvent . document } ` );
// For withAuthContext events
console . log ( `Auth information: ${ cloudEvent . authid } ` );
console . log ( `Auth information: ${ cloudEvent . authtype } ` );
Python
print ( f "Function triggered by change to: { cloud_event [ 'source' ] } " )
print ( f "Event type: { cloud_event [ 'type' ] } " )
print ( f "Event time: { cloud_event [ 'time' ] } " )
print ( f "Event project: { cloud_event [ 'project' ] } " )
print ( f "Location: { cloud_event [ 'location' ] } " )
print ( f "Database name: { cloud_event [ 'database' ] } " )
print ( f "Document: { cloud_event [ 'document' ] } " )
// For withAuthContext events
print ( f "Auth information: { cloud_event [ 'authid' ] } " )
print ( f "Auth information: { cloud_event [ 'authtype' ] } " )
Event structures
This trigger invokes your service with an event similar to:
{
"oldValue" : { // Update and Delete operations only
A Docume nt objec t co nta i n i n g a pre - opera t io n docume nt s na psho t
},
"updateMask" : { // Update operations only
A Docume nt Mask objec t t ha t lis ts cha n ged f ields.
},
"value" : {
// A Document object containing a post-operation document snapshot
}
}
Each Document object contains one or more Value objects. See the
Value documentation
for type references.
Create triggers for functions
Click the tab for instructions using the tool of your choice.
Console
When you use the Google Cloud console to create a function, you can also add a trigger
to your function. Follow these steps to create a trigger for your function:
In the Google Cloud console, go to Cloud Run:
Go to Cloud Run
Click Write a function , and enter the function details. For more
information about configuring functions during deployment, see
Deploy functions .
In the Trigger section, click Add trigger .
Select Firestore trigger .
In the Eventarc trigger pane, modify the
trigger details as follows:
Enter a name for the trigger in the Trigger name field, or use
the default name.
Select a Trigger type from the list:
Google Sources to specify triggers for
Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, Firestore,
and other Google event providers.
Third-party to integrate with non-Google providers
that offer an Eventarc source. For more information,
see Third-party events in Eventarc .
Select Firestore from the Event provider list, to select a product
that provides the type of event for triggering your function. For
the list of event providers, see Event providers and destinations .
Select type=google.cloud.firestore.document.v1.created from the Event type list. Your
trigger configuration varies depending on the supported event type.
For more information, see Event types .
In the Filters section, select a database, operation and attribute values, or use the default selections.
If the Region field is enabled, select a location
for the Eventarc
trigger. In general, the location of an Eventarc
trigger should match the location of the Google Cloud resource that
you want to monitor for events. In most scenarios, you should also
deploy your function in the same region. See Understand Eventarc locations
for more details about Eventarc trigger locations.
In the Service account field, select a service account.
Eventarc triggers are linked to service accounts to
use as an identity when invoking your function. Your
Eventarc trigger's service account must have the permission
to invoke your function. By default, Cloud Run
uses the Compute Engine default service account .
Optionally, specify the Service URL path to send the incoming
request to. This is the relative path on the destination service to
which the events for the trigger should be sent. For example:
/ , /route , route , and route/subroute .
Once you've completed the required fields, click Save trigger .
Click Create .
In the Source tab, edit the source code if needed, then select
Save and redeploy .
gcloud
When you create a function using the gcloud CLI, you must first
deploy your function, and then create a
trigger. Follow these steps to create a trigger for your function:
Run the following command in the directory that contains the sample code
to deploy your function:
gcloud run deploy FUNCTION \
--source . \
--function FUNCTION_ENTRYPOINT \
--base-image BASE_IMAGE_ID \
--region REGION
Replace:
FUNCTION with the name of the function you are
deploying. You can omit this parameter entirely,
but you will be prompted for the name if you omit it.
FUNCTION_ENTRYPOINT with the entry point to your function in
your source code. This is the code Cloud Run executes when your
function runs. The value of this flag must be a function name or
fully-qualified class name that exists in your source code.
BASE_IMAGE_ID with the base image environment for your
function. For more details about base images and the packages included
in each image, see Runtimes base images .
REGION with the Google Cloud
region where you want to deploy
your function. For example, europe-west1 .
Run the following command to create a trigger that filters events:
gcloud eventarc triggers create TRIGGER_NAME \
--location= EVENTARC_TRIGGER_LOCATION \
--destination-run-service= FUNCTION \
--destination-run-region= REGION \
--event-filters="type=google.cloud.firestore.document.v1.created" \
--service-account= PROJECT_NUMBER -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
Replace:
TRIGGER_NAME with the name for your trigger.
EVENTARC_TRIGGER_LOCATION with the location for
the Eventarc trigger. In general, the location of an
Eventarc trigger should match the location of the Google Cloud resource that you want to monitor for events. In most scenarios, you should also deploy your function in the same region. For more information, see Eventarc locations .
FUNCTION with the name of the function you are
deploying.
REGION with the Cloud Run region
of the function.
PROJECT_NUMBER with your Google Cloud project number. Eventarc triggers are linked to service accounts to use
as an identity when invoking your function. Your Eventarc trigger's service account must have the permission to invoke your function. By
default, Cloud Run uses the Default compute service account.
Each event-filters flag specifies a type of event, with the function
triggering only when an event meets all of the criteria specified in its
event-filters flags. Each trigger must have an event-filters flag
specifying a supported event type ,
such as a new document written to Firestore or a file uploaded
to Cloud Storage. You can't change the event filter type after creation.
To change the event filter type, you must create a new trigger and
delete the old one. Optionally, you can repeat the --event-filters
flag with a supported filter in the form ATTRIBUTE=VALUE to add more
filters.
Terraform
To create an Eventarc trigger for a Cloud Run function,
see Create a trigger using Terraform .
Examples
The following examples describe how to use Firestore in Native Mode events to trigger a Cloud Run function.
Example 1: Hello Firestore function
The following sample prints the fields of a triggering Firestore event:
Node.js
/**
* Cloud Event Function triggered by a change to a Firestore document.
*/
const functions = require ( '@google-cloud/functions-framework' );
const protobuf = require ( 'protobufjs' );
functions . cloudEvent ( 'helloFirestore' , async cloudEvent = > {
console . log ( `Function triggered by event on: ${ cloudEvent . source } ` );
console . log ( `Event type: ${ cloudEvent . type } ` );
console . log ( 'Loading protos...' );
const root = await protobuf . load ( 'data.proto' );
const DocumentEventData = root . lookupType (
'google.events.cloud.firestore.v1.DocumentEventData'
);
console . log ( 'Decoding data...' );
const firestoreReceived = DocumentEventData . decode ( cloudEvent . data );
console . log ( '\nOld value:' );
console . log ( JSON . stringify ( firestoreReceived . oldValue , null , 2 ));
console . log ( '\nNew value:' );
console . log ( JSON . stringify ( firestoreReceived . value , null , 2 ));
});

Deploy the function
To deploy the Hello Firestore function, run the following command:
If you haven't already done so, set up your
Firestore database .
To deploy the function, see Create triggers for functions .
Test the function
To test the Hello Firestore function, set up a collection called
users in your Firestore database :
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Firestore databases page:
Go to Firestore
Click Start a collection .
Specify users as the collection ID.
To start adding the collection's first document, under
Add its first document accept the auto-generated Document ID .
Add at least one field for the document, specifying a name and value.
For example, in Field name , enter username , and in Field value ,
enter rowan .
When you're done, click Save .
This action creates a new document, thereby triggering your function.
To confirm that your function was triggered, click the linked name of the
function in the Google Cloud console
Cloud Run Overview page to open
the Service details page.
Select the Logs tab and look for this string:
Function triggered by change to: //firestore.googleapis.com/projects/ your-project-id /databases/(default)'
Example 2: Convert to Uppercase function
The following example retrieves the value added by the user, converts the string
at that location to uppercase, and replaces the value with the uppercase string:
Node.js
Use protobufjs to decode the event
data. Include the google.events.cloud.firestore.v1
data.proto
in your source.
const functions = require ( '@google-cloud/functions-framework' );
const Firestore = require ( ' @google-cloud/firestore ' );
const protobuf = require ( 'protobufjs' );
const firestore = new Firestore ({
projectId : process . env . GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT ,
});
// Converts strings added to /messages/{pushId}/original to uppercase
functions . cloudEvent ( 'makeUpperCase' , async cloudEvent = > {
console . log ( 'Loading protos...' );
const root = await protobuf . load ( 'data.proto' );
const DocumentEventData = root . lookupType (
'google.events.cloud.firestore.v1.DocumentEventData'
);
console . log ( 'Decoding data...' );
const firestoreReceived = DocumentEventData . decode ( cloudEvent . data );
const resource = firestoreReceived . value . name ;
const affectedDoc = firestore . doc ( resource . split ( '/documents/' )[ 1 ]);
const curValue = firestoreReceived . value . fields . original . stringValue ;
const newValue = curValue . toUpperCase ();
if ( curValue === newValue ) {
// Value is already upper-case
// Don't perform a(nother) write to avoid infinite loops
console . log ( 'Value is already upper-case.' );
return ;
}
console . log ( `Replacing value: ${ curValue } --> ${ newValue } ` );
affectedDoc . set ({
original : newValue ,
});
});

Note: Updating the function-triggering Firestore document might create
subsequent updated events, which might cascade into an infinite loop within your
function. To solve this problem, use trigger types that ignore updates (such as
created ), or configure your function to only write to Firestore if the
underlying value has changed.
Deploy the function
To deploy the Convert to Uppercase function, run the following command:
If you haven't already done so, set up your
Firestore database .
To deploy the function, see Create triggers for functions .
Test the function
To test the Convert to Uppercase function you just deployed, set up
a collection called messages in your
Firestore database :
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Firestore databases page:
Go to Firestore
Click Start a collection .
Specify messages as the collection ID.
To start adding the collection's first document, under
Add its first document accept the auto-generated Document ID .
To trigger your deployed function, add a document where the Field name is
original and the Field value is minka .
When you save the document, you can see the lowercase word in the value
field convert to uppercase.
If you subsequently edit the field value to contain lowercase letters, that
triggers the function again, converting all lowercase letters to
uppercase.
Limitations for functions
Ordering is not guaranteed. Rapid changes can trigger function invocations in
an unexpected order.
Events are delivered at least once, but a single event might result in
multiple function invocations. Avoid depending on
exactly-once mechanics, and write
idempotent functions .
A trigger is associated with a single database. You can't create a trigger
that matches multiple databases.
Deleting a database doesn't automatically delete any triggers for that
database. The trigger stops delivering events but continues to exist until you
delete the trigger .
