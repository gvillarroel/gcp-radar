Back up and restore data
This page describes how to use the Firestore scheduled backups
feature. Use backups to protect your data from application-level data
corruption or from accidental data deletion.
Backups let you configure backup schedules to take daily or weekly
backups of the specified database. You can then use these backups to restore
data to a new database.
About backups
A backup is a consistent copy of the database at a point in time.
The backup contains all data and index configurations at that point
in time.
A backup does not contain database time to live policies or Firebase Security Rules.
A backup resides in the same location as the source database.
Backups have a configurable retention period and are stored until the retention
period expires or until you delete the backup. Deleting the source database does
not automatically delete related backups.
Firestore stores metadata related to backups and backup
schedules related to a database. Firestore retains this metadata
until all backups for the database expire or are deleted.
Creating or retaining backups does not affect the performance of reads or
writes in your live database.
Costs
When you use backups, you're charged for the following:
The amount of storage used by each backup.
For a restore operation, you're charged based on the size of the backup.
For more details and exact rates, see the Pricing page.
Before you begin
Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project.
Learn how to check if billing is enabled on a project .
Required roles
To get the permissions that you need to manage backups and backup schedules,
ask your administrator to grant you one or more of the following Identity and Access Management
roles:
roles/datastore.owner : Full access to the Firestore database
roles/datastore.backupsAdmin : Read and write access to backups
roles/datastore.backupsViewer : Read access to backups
roles/datastore.backupSchedulesAdmin : Read and write access to backup schedules
roles/datastore.backupSchedulesViewer : Read access to backup schedules
roles/datastore.restoreAdmin : Permissions to initiate restore operations
Create and manage backup schedules
The following examples demonstrate how to set up a backup schedule. For each
database, you can configure up to one daily backup schedule and up to one weekly
backup schedule. You cannot configure multiple weekly backups schedules for
different days of the week.
You cannot configure the exact time of day of the backup. Backups are taken at
different times each day. For weekly backup
schedules, you can configure the day of the week to take a backup.

BACKUP_ID : The ID of a backup. You
can view the ID of each backup when you list all backups .
Note: Firestore stores metadata related to backups and backup
schedules related to a database. Firestore retains this metadata
until all backups for the database expire or are deleted.
Restore data from a database backup
A restore operation writes the data from a backup to a new Firestore
database.
To begin a restore operation, use one of the following methods:
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Databases page.
Go to Databases
In the list of databases, find the row for the database. In the
Scheduled backups column click either View backups or
Edit settings , depending on whether a backup schedule exists.
The Disaster recovery page opens. This page describes backup schedules
and lists available backups.
In the Backups table, find the row for a backup and in the Actions
column, click View more ( more_vert ). Click Restore with Cloud Shell .
The Cloud Shell panel opens with a gcloud CLI command
to restore from the selected backup. Replace ID_OF_NEW_DATABASE with
an ID for the database and run the command.
Running the command returns a response with more information about the
operation. The database soon appears in your list of databases. The restore
operation will take some time and must complete before the database is accessible.
gcloud
Use the gcloud firestore databases restore command:
gcloud firestore databases restore \
--source-backup=projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /backups/ BACKUP_ID \
--destination-database=' DATABASE_ID \
--tags=[ KEY = VALUE ]'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
LOCATION : The location of the database backup and the
location of the new database created for the restored data.
BACKUP_ID : The ID of a backup.
You can view the ID of each backup when you list all backups .
DATABASE_ID : A database ID for the new
database. You cannot use a database ID that is already in use.
[ KEY = VALUE ]: A optional list of tags KEY=VALUE pairs to bind. For example:
--tags=123/environment=production,123/costCenter=marketing
--tags=tagKeys/333=tagValues/444
The database mode will match that of the backup.
The output will include metadata , name , and response components:
metadata:
'@type': type.googleapis.com/google.firestore.admin.v1.RestoreDatabaseMetadata
backup: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /backups/ BACKUP_ID
database: projects/ PROJECT_ID /databases/ DATABASE_ID
operationState: PROCESSING
progressPercentage:
completedWork: '20'
estimatedWork: '100'
startTime: '2023-12-06T14:20:17.398325Z'
name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /databases/ DATABASE_ID /operations/operation_uuid
response:
'@type': type.googleapis.com/google.firestore.admin.v1.Database
createTime: '2023-12-06T14:20:17.398325Z'
name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /databases/ DATABASE_ID
...
The metadata field includes a progressPercentage component, detailing the estimated progress of the restore thus far, and an operationState specifying the overall state of the restore.
To retrieve this information again, use gcloud firestore operations list :
gcloud firestore operations list --database= DATABASE_ID
or, using the name field from the output described above, with gcloud firestore operations describe :
gcloud firestore operations describe OPERATION_NAME
Limitations
A restore operation does not restore App Engine search data or blob entities from a (default) database. This data is only valid for the (default) database, and it won't be useful if you restore from (default) to a database which does not support such data, so it is excluded from backups.
What to do after restoring
After you finish restoring, you should do the following:
If you previously used Firebase Security Rules , configure your rules for the restored database. By default, the rules for a database that was not previously used prohibit all reads and writes from web and mobile clients. If the database ID you chose was previously used in the same project, you should check if Security Rules for that database ID already exist and, if so, if they are compatible with the requirements of your application.
Verify that appropriate IAM controls are applied to your new database.
If you previously used TTL policies, reapply them to the new database. TTL policies are not included in backups and are not automatically reapplied to restored databases.
