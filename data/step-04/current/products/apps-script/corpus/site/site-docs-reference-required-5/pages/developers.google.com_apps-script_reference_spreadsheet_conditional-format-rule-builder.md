Page Summary
outlined_flag
The ConditionalFormatRuleBuilder class in Google Apps Script provides methods to set conditional formatting rules based on date, formula, number, and text conditions.
Date-based methods like whenDateBefore and whenDateEqualTo can use either specific dates or relative dates such as RelativeDate.TODAY .
whenFormulaSatisfied allows applying formatting based on a custom formula that evaluates to true.
A comprehensive set of methods starting with whenNumber enables formatting based on numerical comparisons like equality, inequality, greater than/less than, and being within or outside a range.
Text-based conditions using methods like whenTextContains and whenTextEqualTo allow formatting based on whether cells contain, do not contain, start with, end with, or are exactly equal to a specific text string.
ConditionalFormatRuleBuilder
Builder for conditional format rules.
// Adds a conditional format rule to a sheet that causes cells in range A1:B3 to
// turn red if they contain a number between 1 and 10.
const sheet = SpreadsheetApp . getActiveSheet ();
const range = sheet . getRange ( 'A1:B3' );
const rule = SpreadsheetApp . newConditionalFormatRule ()
. whenNumberBetween ( 1 , 10 )
. setBackground ( '#FF0000' )
. setRanges ([ range ])
. build ();
const rules = sheet . getConditionalFormatRules ();
rules . push ( rule );
sheet . setConditionalFormatRules ( rules );
