Container-bound Scripts

Page Summary
outlined_flag
A bound script is attached to a specific Google Sheets, Docs, Slides, or Forms file, called its container.
Bound scripts behave similarly to standalone scripts but do not appear in Google Drive and cannot be detached from their container.
Bound scripts have special privileges, including the ability to refer to their parent file without its ID and interact with the parent file's user interface to add custom menus, dialogs, and sidebars.
Bound scripts can be created from within the Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms file they will be bound to.
Bound scripts can use simple and installable triggers, and in Google Sheets, they can be used to create custom functions.
A script is bound to a Google Sheets, Google Docs,
Google Slides, or Google Forms file if it was created from that document
rather than as a standalone script . The file
that a bound script is attached to is called a "container." Bound scripts
generally behave like standalone scripts except that they don't appear in
Google Drive, they can't be detached from the file they are bound to, and
they gain a few special privileges over the parent file.
Scripts can also be bound to Google Sites, but these scripts are almost
always deployed as web apps . Scripts bound to
Sheets, Docs, Slides, or
Forms can also become web apps, although this is uncommon.
Bound scripts are effectively unpublished
Google Workspace add-ons that
function only for the file they are bound to.
Create a bound script
You can create bound scripts in Docs, Sheets,
Slides, and Forms.
Docs, Sheets, or Slides
To create a bound script in Docs, Sheets, or
Slides, open a document in Docs, a spreadsheet in
Sheets, or a presentation in Slides and click
Extensions >
Apps Script . To reopen the script in the future, do the same
thing or open the script from the Apps Script
dashboard .
Forms
To create a bound script in Forms, open a form and click
More more_vert
> Script editor . To reopen the script in
the future, do the same thing or open the script from the
Apps Script dashboard .
The clasp tool can't create bound scripts, but it
can clone and edit them.
Special methods
Bound scripts can call a few methods that standalone scripts can't:
getActiveSpreadsheet ,
getActiveDocument ,
getActivePresentation ,
and getActiveForm
allow bound scripts to refer to their parent file without referring to the
file's ID.
getUi lets
bound scripts access the user interface for their parent file to add custom
menus, dialogs, and sidebars .
In Sheets,
getActiveSheet ,
getActiveRange ,
and
getActiveCell
let the script determine the user's current sheet, selected range of cells, or
selected individual cell.
setActiveSheet
and
setActiveRange
let the script change those selections.
In Docs,
getActiveTab ,
getCursor , and
getSelection
let the script determine the user's current tab, position of the user's
cursor, or selected text.
setActiveTab ,
setCursor
and
setSelection
let the script change those selections.
For more information, see the guide to extending
Sheets or the guide to extending
Docs .
These methods are only available to bound scripts run from the script editor,
menu items, dialogs, sidebars, or triggers. When a bound script is run as a web
app or using the Google Apps Script API , these
methods aren't available.
Custom menus, dialogs, and sidebars
Bound scripts can customize Sheets, Docs, and
Forms by adding custom menus and
dialog boxes or sidebars . A script can only
interact with the user interface for the current instance of an open file.
A script bound to one document can't affect the user interface of another
document.
Add-ons can also add custom menus, dialogs
and sidebars. It is recommended to develop add-ons using
standalone scripts .
Triggers
Bound scripts can use simple triggers like the
special onOpen function, which runs automatically whenever a file is opened
by a user who has edit access. Like all types of scripts, they can also use
installable triggers .
Custom functions
A custom function is a function in a
script bound to Sheets that you call directly from a cell using
the syntax =myFunctionName() . Custom functions are similar to the hundreds of
built-in functions in
Sheets like
AVERAGE or
SUM except that you define
the custom function's behavior.
Access to bound scripts
Only users who have permission to edit a container can run its bound script.
Collaborators who have only view access can't open the script editor. If they
make a copy of the container file, they become the owner of the copy and can see
and run a copy of the script.
To learn how to share a script's container file, refer to Share files from
Drive .
All container-bound scripts use the same owner, viewer, and
editor access list defined for the container file. The container owner takes
ownership of a new script project regardless of who created it.
