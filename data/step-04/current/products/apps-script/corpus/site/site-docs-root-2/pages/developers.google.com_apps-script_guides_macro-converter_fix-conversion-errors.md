Page Summary
outlined_flag
The Macro Converter automates most of the conversion process but requires manual adjustments for some APIs and other items.
Additional Apps Script files are added to your project to define VBA constants, implement unconverted APIs, and resolve variants.
You can fix most errors in the unimplemented_constructs.gs and variant_resolution.gs files.
Error types include unimplemented APIs, unimplemented language constructs, partially supported APIs, manual work needed, and intentional errors.
Each error type has a description and guidance on how to find and fix it, including code examples for common scenarios.
The Macro Converter Google Workspace add-on automates most of the conversion
process, but you might need to make adjustments to some APIs and other items to
finalize your code.
Use this guide to understand the Apps Script files (GS files)
added to your project, interpret the different error types, and learn how to fix
errors.
Understand Apps Script files added to your project
Additional GS files are added to your Apps Script project to
help:
Define VBA constants and values that don't exist in
Apps Script.
Implement unconverted APIs.
Resolve variants.
The following GS files are added to your Apps Script project:
Library.gs
Unimplemented_constructs.gs
Variant_resolutions.gs
Library.gs
In general, you don't need to modify anything in the library.gs file.
The library.gs file defines functions and constants that were used in your VBA
code that don't exist in Apps Script. This helps the new
Apps Script code better resemble your VBA code. Additionally, you
don't need to repeat definitions every time functions or constants from the
library.gs file are used.
Unimplemented_constructs.gs
The unimplemented_constructs.gs file addresses constructs or APIs that
couldn't be converted by the Macro Converter. You likely need to modify this
file to make your code work as intended.
Example: Window.Activate
The following is an example of an unsupported API called Window.Activate . The
Macro Converter creates a new Apps Script function with a similar
name and defines it in the unimplemented_constructs.gs file. Since the VBA
function isn't supported, the new Apps Script function throws an
exception.
The new function is added to the converted Apps Script code
everywhere the original API was used in the VBA code.
If you find a workaround to recreate the behavior of the original API, you only
need to update the definition of the function in the
unimplemented_constructs.gs file. Once the function is defined there, it
applies everywhere the function appears in your Apps Script
project.
Here's the example in code:
Original VBA code
Window.activate()
Converted Apps Script code, added in-line
_api_window_activate ();
Function definition added to the unimplemented_constructs.gs file
/**
* Could not convert window.activate API. Please add relevant code in the
* following function to implement it.
* This API has been used at the following locations in the VBA script.
* module1 : line 3
*
* We couldn't find an equivalent API in Apps Script for this VBA API. Please
* reconsider if this function call is critical, otherwise consider implementing
* it in a different way.
*/
function _api_window_activate ( CallingObject ) {
ThrowException ( "API window.activate not supported yet." );
}
Variant_resolutions.gs
The variant_resolutions.gs file is added to your Apps Script
project if an object's type can't be determined. This can happen for multiple
reasons, such as an API having multiple return types or the object is declared
as a variant itself.
The Macro Converter adds a new function to this file called
__handle_resolve_<api> that replaces the API in question and helps determine
the object type.
In some cases, you might need to update the __handle_resolve_<api> function
to manually declare the object type. See Unsupported object
type .
Example: The name method
Many object types in VBA define a name method. Usually, the
Apps Script equivalent is getName , but not for every object
type. Multiple alternative cases can occur:
The object's equivalent method is called something different than getName .
The object doesn't have an Apps Script API to get its name.
There isn't an equivalent Apps Script object.
When the object type isn't determined, the Macro Converter creates a new
function called __handle_resolve_name in the variant_resolutions.gs file.
Here's the example in code:
Original VBA code
a = Selection.name
In this case, the name method is called on the current selection. The
selection could be a Sheet object or a Shape object. If it's a Sheet object, the
translation is getName , but if it's a Shape object, there is no equivalent in
Apps Script.
Converted Apps Script code, added in-line
a = __handle_resolve_name ({}, getActiveSelection (), {});
The following __handle_resolve_name function is added to the
variant_resolution.gs file to solve for different object types. The function
checks the object type, then uses getName if it's supported, or throws an
error if getName isn't supported.
Function definition added to the variant_resolution.gs file
function __handle_resolve_name ( ExecutionContext , CallingObject , params_map ) {
var found_api_variant = false ;
var return_value ;
if ( String ( CallingObject ) == "Sheet" ) {
if ( ! ExecutionContext . isLhs ) {
return_value = CallingObject . getName ();
found_api_variant = true ;
}
}
if ( CallingObject instanceof ChartInSheet ) {
if ( ! ExecutionContext . isLhs ) {
return_value = CallingObject . getName ();
found_api_variant = true ;
}
}
if ( ! found_api_variant ) {
ThrowException ( "API .name not supported yet." );
}
return return_value ;
}
Find errors
When you run into an error in the converted Apps Script code, the
message specifies the type of error and its location. The format of the error
message depends on which Apps Script runtime you're using.
If you're in the default V8 runtime, you'll see an error that looks like the
following:
_api_windows_active (unimplemented_constructs:2:3)
This means the error is located in the unimplemented_constructs.gs file at
line 2, character 3.
If you're in the deprecated Rhino runtime, you'll see an error that looks like
the following:
unimplemented_constructs:2 (_api_windows_active)
This means the error is located in the unimplemented_constructs.gs file at
line 2.
Error Types
Fix most of the errors you run into in the unimplemented_constructs.gs
and variant_resolution.gs files described previously.
The types of errors you might run into include:
Unimplemented API
Unimplemented language construct
Partially supported API
Manual work needed
Intentional Error
Unimplemented API
An unimplemented API is an API that the Macro Converter can't convert from VBA
to Apps Script and there isn't a known workaround for the API.
Unimplemented APIs are usually added as empty functions—sometimes with empty
signatures—to the unimplemented_constructs.gs file. If the object type
couldn't be determined, the unimplemented API might be added to the
variant_resolution.gs file, instead.
In the compatibility report you generated before the conversion, this API is
labeled as Needs more investigation .
If you don't fix this type of API in your VBA code before you convert your file,
here's how it appears in the Apps Script project:
/**
* Could not convert . Please add relevant code in the following
* function to implement it.
* This API has been used at the following locations in the VBA script.
* :
* We couldn't find an equivalent API in Apps Script for this VBA API. Please
* reconsider if this function call is critical, otherwise consider implementing
* it in a different way.
* @param param1 { }
* @param param2 { }
* ...
* @return { }
*/
function _api_ API_name >( param1 , param2 , ... .) {
ThrowException ( "API not supported yet." );
}
Fix unimplemented API errors
Define the unimplemented API with existing Apps Script APIs or JS
libraries. To do this, follow these steps:
Open the converted Apps Script code at the location of the
error. See Find errors .
Above the function, read the comment that was added. In some cases, the
comment suggests how to implement the API in Apps Script.
If you can't find a way to implement the API in Apps Script,
consider removing it from your code.
If you can't find a workaround or remove this API from your code and your
macro throws this error, you can't convert this macro.
Examples of unimplemented API errors
Here are examples of unimplemented API scenarios and how to fix them:
There's no equivalent Apps Script :
Shows an indirect workaround for Chart.Protect , an API that doesn't exist in
Apps Script.
An unknown object type :
Shows how to handle an object type that's a
variable, and how to implement an unsupported object type that can be
recreated in Apps Script.
Example 1: No equivalent Apps Script or unknown API
In this example, Chart.Protect wasn't automatically converted because there
isn't a way to protect a chart in Google Sheets.
/**
* Could not convert chart.protect API. Please add relevant code in the following
* function to implement it.
*
* This API has been used at the following locations in the VBA script.
* sheet1 : line 3
* You can use the following Apps Script APIs to convert it.
*
* Comments : Auto conversion of Chart.Protect is not supported yet. If the API is
* critical for the workflow the user can implement the unimplemented handler
* method in the generated code, else comment out the throw statement.
*
* @param {Object} CallingObject represents the parent object using which the API
* has been called.
* @param {string} Password
* @param {boolean} DrawingObjects
* @param {boolean} Contents
* @param {boolean} Scenarios
* @param {boolean} UserInterfaceOnly
*
*/
function _api_chart_protect (
CallingObject , Password , DrawingObjects , Contents , Scenarios ,
UserInterfaceOnly ) {
ThrowException ( ' API chart . protect not supported yet . ' );
}
Even though you can’t protect a chart, you can protect the data range of the
chart so that the data can’t be changed.
Note : When you protect the data range, the document owner can still
modify the range and the chart type can still be changed.
A sample implementation of protecting the range is shown below:
/**
* Could not convert chart.protect API. Please add relevant code in the following
* function to implement it.
* This API has been used at the following locations in the VBA script.
* sheet1 : line 3
*
* You can use the following Apps Script APIs to convert it.
* Comments : Auto conversion of Chart.Protect is not supported yet. If the API
* is critical for the workflow the user can implement the unimplemented handler
* method in the generated code, else comment out the throw statement.
*
* @param {Object} CallingObject represents the parent object using which the API
* has been called.
* @param {string} Password
* @param {boolean} DrawingObjects
* @param {boolean} Contents
* @param {boolean} Scenarios
* @param {boolean} UserInterfaceOnly
*/
function _api_chart_protect (
CallingObject , Password , DrawingObjects , Contents , Scenarios , UserInterfaceOnly ) {
var ranges = CallingObject . getChart (). getRanges ();
for ( var i = 0 ; i ranges . length ; i ++ ) {
// Note that this does not lock the range for the document owner .
ranges [ i ] . protect ();
}
}
Example 2: Unsupported object type
When the object type is unknown, the unimplemented API error is added to the
variant_resolution.gs file. The following example expands on the VBA name
method example. See variant_resolution.gs .
In this example, you'll learn:
How the name method is converted to a new function in the
variant_resolution.gs file .
How the new function is called in the converted code .
How to create a workaround for CommandBar , an unsupported object type,
in Apps Script .
1. Since the converted code can't determine the exact object type that name
is called on, the Macro Converter creates a new function called
__handle_resolve_name :
function __handle_resolve_name ( ExecutionContext , CallingObject , params_map ) {
var found_api_variant = false ;
var return_value ;
if ( String ( CallingObject ) == "Sheet" ) {
if ( ! ExecutionContext . isLhs ) {
return_value = CallingObject . getName ();
found_api_variant = true ;
}
}
if ( CallingObject instanceof ChartInSheet ) {
if ( ! ExecutionContext . isLhs ) {
return_value = CallingObject . getName ();
found_api_variant = true ;
}
}
if ( ! found_api_variant ) {
ThrowException ( 'API .name not supported yet.' );
}
return return_value ;
}
2. Suppose the VBA code defines a PrintName() function that calls the
name API:
‘Defining a function that prints the name of the object in parameter
Sub PrintName(obj as Variant)
Debug.Print obj.Name
End Sub
Since `name()` is called on an object that’s a variable, the converted code
doesn’t know the object type at the time of conversion. The converted Apps
Script code will call the `__handle_resolve_name` function:
function PrintName(obj) {
Logger.log(_handle_resolve_name(obj));
}
3. Suppose your VBA code calls the PrintName() function on the object type
CommandBar :
PrintName Application.CommandBars.item("Standard")
CommandBar isn’t supported in Apps Script and as a result, the two
methods used in the VBA code above are also not supported.
Application.CommandBars() : In VBA, this returns a list of all
CommandBar objects.
CommandBars.item() : In VBA, this returns a specific
CommandBar object.
Because this object type isn’t supported in Apps Script, the converted code
creates the following functions in the `unimplemented_constructs.gs` file that
you need to define.
_api_application_commandbars()
_api_commandbars_item()
The functions are called in the converted code as shown below:
PrintName ( _api_commandbars_item ( _api_application_commandbars (), "Standard" )))
Here ’ s how the new functions are added to the unimplemented_construct . gs file :
function _api_application_commandbars ( CallingObject ) {
ThrowException ( 'API application.commandbars not supported yet.' );
}
function _api_commandbars_item ( CallingObject , index ) {
ThrowException ( 'API commandbars.item not supported yet.' );
}
To get the new functions to work, take the following steps:
3.1 Define a new object type that creates the functionalities of CommandBars
and a new collection of CommandBars similar to what exists in VBA.
3.2 Add a getName method for the new object type.
Steps 3.1 and 3.2 are shown in the following code. Menu objects are created as a
new object type that mimics the behavior of CommandBars .
// Our Implementation of CommandBar using Menu objects .
function CommandBar ( name ) {
this . name = name ;
// Create a menu object to represent the commandbar .
this . menu = SpreadsheetApp . getUi (). createMenu ( name );
// Create methods for retrieving or updating the name of the object
this . getName = function () {
return this . name ;
} ;
this . updateName = function ( name ) {
this . name = name ;
} ;
// ========================================================================
// Implement other methods of CommandBar objects that are used in the script .
// =====================================================================
return this ;
}
// Our implementation of the collection of CommandBars that exists in VBA
function CommandBars () {
this . commandBars = [] ;
this . getCommandBar = function ( name ) {
for ( var i = 0 ; i this . commandBars . length ; i ++ ) {
if ( ! this . commandBars [ i ] . getName () == name ) {
return this . commandBars [ i ] ;
}
}
// No commandBar with the name exists , create a new one and return .
var commandBar = new CommandBar ( name );
this . commandBars . push ( commandBar );
return commandBar ;
} ;
return this ;
}
// Create a global object that represents CommandBars collection .
var GlobalCommandBars = new CommandBars ();
3.3 Modify the __handle_resolve_name function in the variant_resolution.gs
file to handle the new object type. Add a section to the function:
function __handle_resolve_name ( ExecutionContext , CallingObject , params_map ) {
var found_api_variant = false ;
var return_value ;
if ( String ( CallingObject ) == "Sheet" ) {
if ( ! ExecutionContext . isLhs ) {
return_value = CallingObject . getName ();
found_api_variant = true ;
}
}
if ( CallingObject instanceof ChartInSheet ) {
if ( ! ExecutionContext . isLhs ) {
return_value = CallingObject . getName ();
found_api_variant = true ;
}
}
// New section added below
// ========================================================================
if ( CallingObject instanceof CommandBar ) {
objectExtend ( params_map , { VALUETOSET : params_map . param0 });
if ( ExecutionContext . isLhs ) {
// Call the setter method .
CallingObject . updateName ( params_map . VALUETOSET );
found_api_variant = true ;
} else {
// Getter is called , return the commandbar name ,
return_value = CallingObject . getName ();
found_api_variant = true ;
}
}
// ========================================================================
// New section added above
if ( ! found_api_variant ) {
ThrowException ( 'API .name not supported yet.' );
}
return return_value ;
}
3.4 Define the two functions created in the unimplemented_constructs.gs file
( _api_application_commandbars , _api_commandbars_item ). This step makes
sure the original calls of the function work.
//This is straightforward based on the implementation of a CommandBar and the
// CommandBars collection above:
function _api_application_commandbars ( CallingObject ) {
return GlobalCommandBars ;
}
function _api_commandbars_item ( CallingObject , index ) {
return CallingObject . getCommandBar ( index );
}
Unimplemented language constructs
A construct is an element of the code language that controls execution flow
or data display. For example, loops, labels, events, and gotos.
For a list of all VBA constructs, see Statements
(VBA) .
Constructs that the Macro Converter can't convert are considered unimplemented
language constructs .
Where the Macro Converter determines that an unimplemented language construct
exists, it inserts a TODO comment.
The following VBA constructs aren't supported:
AddressOf
Declare
DefType
GoSub
GoTo
Implements
Lset
Open
RaiseEvent
Name
Resume
Rset
TypeOf
Class
Class Modules
Fix unimplemented language construct errors
Update your code so that your logic doesn't rely on the unsupported language
construct.
Open the converted Apps Script code at the location of the error. See Find
errors .
Based on the logic of the code, update it in a way that doesn't require the
unsupported language construct.
If you can't find a way to rewrite your code without the unsupported language
construct, you can't convert this macro.
Examples of unimplemented language construct errors
One of the most common unimplemented language constructs is a GoTo statement.
Replace some VBA GoTo statements with loops. The following examples
use loops instead of GoTo statements.
Example 1: Replace GoTo with While Loop
Original VBA code
Sub Test()
a = 0
start: Debug.Print a
While a
Equivalent Apps Script code
function test () {
var a = 0 ;
start : do {
console . log ( a );
while ( a 100 ) {
a = a + 1 ;
if ( a % 3 == 0 ) {
continue start ;
}
}
break start ;
} while ( true );
}
Example 2: Replace GoTo with For Loop
Original VBA code
Sub Test()
a = 0
For i = 1 to 100
For j = 1 to 10
a =a a + 1
If i + j > 50
GoTo endLoop
End If
Next j
Next i
endLoop: MsgBox a
End Sub
Equivalent Apps Script code
function test () {
var a = 0 ;
endLoop : for ( var i = 1 ; i 100 ; i ++ ) {
for ( var j = 0 ; j 10 ; j ++ ) {
If ( i + j > 50 ) {
break endLoop ;
}
}
}
Browser . msgBox ( a );
}
break start ;
} while ( true );
}
Partially supported API
For Partially supported APIs , some input parameters are supported in
Apps Script and some aren't.
For example, the VBA API legend_position is used to define the legend in an
Excel graph. It supports multiple types of input values, including:
xlLegendPositionBottom : Puts the legend at the bottom of the chart.
xlLegendPositionCorner : Puts the legend at the corner of the chart.
xlLegendPositionCustom : Puts the legend at custom positions on the chart.
Apps Script has an equivalent code that supports only some of
those values. The following values are not supported:
xlLegendPositionCorner
xlLegendPositionCustom
To flag unsupported values of partially supported APIs in your converted code,
a validating condition is added to the library.gs file that checks for those
values. For example:
if ( position == xlLegendPositionCorner ||
position == xlLegendPositionCustom ) {
position = _handle_legend_position_error ( position );
}
If the validating condition finds one of the unsupported values, an error
handler function, _handle_<API_name>_error , is created in the
unimplemented_constructs.gs file.
The function throws a user error and won't replace the value with a supported
value. For example:
/**
* Throw error message for unsupported legend position .
* The VBA API Legend . Position which can take values xlLegendPositionTop ,
* xlLegendPositionLeft , xlLegendPositionBottom , xlLegendPositionRight ,
* xlLegendPositionCorner , xlLegendPositionCustom . It is partially supported in
* Apps Scripts that supports only a subset of the values ( does not support
* xlLegendPositionCorner and xlLegendPositionCustom ).
* @ param { string } position
*/
function _handle_legend_position_error ( position ) {
// Please comment the throw statement and return a supported position value
// instead.
// Values that are supported here are xlLegendPositionTop,
// xlLegendPositionLeft, xlLegendPositionBottom, xlLegendPositionRight.
throw new Error (
'Google Sheets does not support legend position: ' + position );
}
Fix partially supported API errors
Define the _handle_<API_name>_error function to replace the unsupported values
with an acceptable workaround for your needs.
Open the converted Apps Script code at the location of the error. See
Find errors .
Read the comment above the function to understand which values are supported
and which aren't.
For the unsupported values, determine which supported values can act as a
suitable replacement.
Update the function _handle_<API_name>_error to return a supported value
instead.
If you can't find a way to replace the unsupported value, you can't convert
this macro.
Example of a partially supported API error
The following example expands on the VBA API legend_position mentioned previously.
See Partially supported API .
The following example shows original VBA code that uses an unsupported value,
xlLegendPositionCustom .
Charts(1).Legend.Position = xlLegendPositionCustom
The Macro Converter adds the following function to the
unimplemented_constructs.gs file:
/**
* Throw error message for unsupported legend position .
* The VBA API Legend . Position which can take values xlLegendPositionTop ,
* xlLegendPositionLeft , xlLegendPositionBottom , xlLegendPositionRight ,
* xlLegendPositionCorner , xlLegendPositionCustom . It is partially supported in
* Apps Scripts that supports only a subset of the values ( does not support
* xlLegendPositionCorner and xlLegendPositionCustom ).
* @ param { string } position
*/
function _handle_legend_position_error ( position ) {
// Please comment the throw statement and return a supported position value
// instead.
// Values that are supported here are xlLegendPositionTop,
// xlLegendPositionLeft, xlLegendPositionBottom, xlLegendPositionRight.
throw new Error (
'Google Sheets does not support legend position: ' + position );
}
Manual work needed
Manual work needed means that the VBA API can be converted into
Apps Script, but it needs a workaround.
In the compatibility report you generated before the conversion, this type of
API is labeled as Supported with workarounds .
If you don't fix this type of API in your VBA code before you convert your file,
here's how it appears in the Apps Script project:
/**
* Could not convert API. Please add relevant code in the following
* function to implement it.
* This API has been used at the following locations in the VBA script.
* :
*
* You can use the following Apps Script APIs to convert it.
* Apps Script APIs :
* Apps Script documentation links :
*
* @param param1 { }
* @param param2 { }
* ...
* @return { }
*/
function _api_ API_name >( param1 , param2 , ... .) {
ThrowException ( "API not supported yet." );
}
Fix manual work needed errors
Implement a workaround for the API to get the API to work as intended.
1. Open the converted Apps Script code at the location of the
error. See Find errors .
1. Read the comment above the function to understand which APIs can be used for
a workaround.
1. If you can't find a suitable workaround, consider removing the API from your
code.
1. If you can't find a workaround or remove this API from your code and your
macro throws an error, you can't convert this macro.
Examples of Manual work needed errors
Here are examples of APIs that throw Manual work needed errors and how to fix
them:
Example 1: Autocorrect.Addreplacement
In the following example, the VBA API Autocorrect.Addreplacement can be
converted, but it needs a workaround. The Macro Converter suggests how to
implement the function in the code comments.
/**
* Could not convert autocorrect.addreplacement API. Please add relevant code in
* the following function to implement it.
* This API has been used at the following locations in the VBA script.

*/
function _api_autocorrect_addreplacement ( CallingObject , What , Replacement ) {
ThrowException ( ' API autocorrect . addreplacement not supported yet . ' );
}
The following example shows the implementation of the
Autocorrect.Addreplacement API:
var AUTO_CORRECTIONS = "AUTO_CORRECTIONS" ;
// Need to get the autocorrections set in previous sessions and use them .
var savedAutoCorrections = PropertiesService . getDocumentProperties (). getProperty ( AUTO_CORRECTIONS );
var autoCorrections = savedAutoCorrections ? JSON . parse ( savedAutoCorrections ) : {} ;
function onEdit ( e ) {
autoCorrect ( e . range );
}
function autoCorrect ( range ) {
for ( key in autoCorrections ) {
// Replace each word that needs to be auto - corrected with their replacements .
range . createTextFinder ( key )

function _api_autocorrect_addreplacement ( CallingObject , What , Replacement ) {

Example 2: The Workbook.open method
The VBA API workbook.open opens a local file based on a path.
Suppose there are two files being opened by workbook.open in the VBA code:
File 1: C:\Data\abc.xlsx
File 2: C:\Data\xyz.xlsx
The following code shows how the Macro Converter replaces Workbook.open with
Apps Script everywhere Workbook.open is used to open File 1:
var spreadSheetId =
_handle_mso_excel_get_google_spreadsheet_id ( "C:\Data \a bc.xlsx" );
var spreadSheet = SpreadsheetApp . openById ( spreadSheetId );
The below error is added to the unimplemented_constructs.gs file in
the Apps Script project:
/**
* Method to return the spreadsheet id manually .
*
* @ param { string } FileName ID of the spreadsheet to be opened .
* @ return { string } return the spreadsheet id .
*/
function _handle_mso_excel_get_google_spreadsheet_id ( FileName ) {
// Upload the Excel files being opened by the API to Google Drive and convert
// them to Google Sheets .
// Determine the spreadsheet ID of the Google Sheets file created .
// Implement this method to return the corresponding spreadsheet ID when given
// the original file path as parameter .
throw new Error ( 'Please return the spreadsheet ID corresponding to filename: ' + FileName );
return ' ' ;
}
As instructed by the comments in the previous sample, you need to convert the
target files to Sheets files on Drive.
The corresponding Google Spreadsheet IDs are highlighted in the following list:
File #1: C:\Data\abc.xlsx becomes https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ abc123Abc123Abc123abc
File #2: C:\Data\xyz.xlsx becomes https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ xyz456Xyz456xYz456xyZ
Then, modify the code in the Apps Script function to open the
files by ID:
/**
* Method to return the spreadsheet id manually .
*
* @ param { string } FileName ID of the spreadsheet to be opened .
* @ return { string } return the spreadsheet id .
*/
function _handle_mso_excel_get_google_spreadsheet_id ( FileName ) {
// Upload the Excel files being opened by the API to Google Drive and convert
// them to Google Sheets .
// Determine the spreadsheet ID of the Google Sheets file created .
// Implement this method to return the corresponding spreadsheet ID when given
// the original file path as parameter
if ( Filename . indexOf ( "abc.xlsx" ) >= 0 ) {
return "abc123Abc123Abc123abc" ;
} else if ( Filename . indexOf ( "xyz.xlsx" ) >= 0 ) {
return "xyz456Xyz456xYz456xyZ" ;
}
Intentional error
Intentional errors are added to your converted code to mimic the error
behavior of your original VBA code. You don't need to modify these errors.
Example of an intentional error
If you try to access an element beyond the bounds of an array in VBA, the code
throws an exception. In Apps Script, the code returns undefined.
To avoid unexpected results, the Macro Converter adds
Apps Script code that
throws an exception if you try to access elements beyond the bounds of an array.
This example is shown in the following code:
Original VBA code
Dim arr
arr = Array("apple", "orange")
MsgBox arr(5)
Will throw the following error:
Subscript out of range
Converted Apps Script code (before exception error is added)
var arr ;
arr = [ "apple" , "orange" ];
Browser . msgBox ( arr [ 5 ]);
Will return this value and not throw an error :
undefined
Apps Script code added to throw the exception error
/**
* Extend the regular JS array to support VB style indexing with a get method.
* @returns{*} value at the index
*/
Array . prototype . get = function () {
var curr_res = this ;
for ( var i = 0 ; i arguments . length ; i ++ ) {
if ( ! Array . isArray ( curr_res ) || curr_res . length arguments [ i ] ) {
throw new Error ( ‘ Converted VBA Error ( Intentional Error ) : Subscript out of range ’ );
}
curr_res = curr_res [ arguments[i ] ] ;
}
return curr_res ;
} ;
var arr ;
arr = [ "apple", "orange" ] ;
Browser . msgBox ( arr . get ( 5 ));
