Page Summary
outlined_flag
Apps Script's Content service allows scripts to act as "services" by responding to GET and POST requests with raw textual content of various MIME types instead of a user interface.
A simple example demonstrates returning "Hello, world!" as plain text using ContentService.createTextOutput() .
The Content service can be used for more complex tasks like modifying and serving RSS feeds by fetching external data, processing it, and setting the appropriate MIME type.
Scripts can serve JSON data to other scripts or services, as shown with an example that checks calendar availability and returns a JSON object.
By adding a prefix parameter and setting the MIME type to JAVASCRIPT, JSON services can be transformed into JSONP to be called from JavaScript in a browser, though caution is advised due to security risks.
that return raw textual content of various MIME types.
When a script is published as a web app, the callback functions doGet and
doPost execute whenever a request is made to the script's URL. Instead of
returning a user interface object created with the
HTML service , the
Content service can return raw textual
content. Write scripts that act as services, responding to GET and POST
requests and serving data of various MIME types.
The basics
The following example shows how to use the Content service:
function doGet () {
return ContentService . createTextOutput ( 'Hello, world!' );
}
Deploy the script as a web app .
Follow the same steps as serving a user interface. When a GET request is made
to the script's URL, the text Hello, world! returns. In addition to plain
text, the service supports returning ATOM, CSV, iCal, JavaScript, JSON, RSS,
vCard, and XML content.
Serve RSS feeds
Filter an RSS feed to modify its content. For example, edit an
XKCD feed to include alt text directly in the feed for
better mobile viewing.
function doGet () {
var feed = UrlFetchApp . fetch ( 'http://xkcd.com/rss.xml' ). getContentText ();
feed = feed . replace (
/(&lt;img.*?alt="(.*?)".*?&gt;)/g ,
'$1' + new Array ( 10 ). join ( '&lt;br /&gt;' ) + '$2' );
return ContentService . createTextOutput ( feed )
. setMimeType ( ContentService . MimeType . RSS );
}
The code consists of the following components. Use the
URL Fetch service to fetch the original
XKCD RSS feed. Use a standard JavaScript regular expression to make the
substitutions. Wrap the edited feed in a
TextOutput object and set the MIME
type to RSS.
To see this in action, publish the script as a web app and allow anonymous
access. Add the URL of the service to your RSS reader or visit it directly in a
web browser.
Serve JSON from scripts
Use the Content service to serve JSON to other scripts, websites, and services.
The following script implements a service that checks if a calendar slot is
open at a specific time.
function doGet ( request ) {
var events = CalendarApp . getEvents (
new Date ( Number ( request . parameters . start ) * 1000 ),
new Date ( Number ( request . parameters . end ) * 1000 ));
var result = {
available : events . length == 0
};
return ContentService . createTextOutput ( JSON . stringify ( result ))
. setMimeType ( ContentService . MimeType . JSON );
}
Publish this as an anonymous web app. Users can add URL parameters to the end
of the service URL. The start and end parameters specify a time range in
the standard Unix epoch.
curl -L URL_OF_YOUR_SCRIPT?start=1325437200&end=1325439000
The service returns JSON that reports if the calendar is open in that range.
{ "available" : true }
Serve JSONP in web pages
With a slight change, your JSON service can become
JSONP to be called from JavaScript in a
browser.
function doGet ( request ) {
var events = CalendarApp . getEvents (
new Date ( Number ( request . parameters . start ) * 1000 ),
new Date ( Number ( request . parameters . end ) * 1000 ));
var result = {
available : events . length == 0
};
return ContentService . createTextOutput (
request . parameters . prefix + '(' + JSON . stringify ( result ) + ')' )
. setMimeType ( ContentService . MimeType . JAVASCRIPT );
}
To call this service from a browser, create a script tag with a src attribute
set to the service URL and an additional prefix parameter. This is the name
of the function in your client-side JavaScript that is called with the value
returned by the service.
<script src="URL_OF_YOUR_SCRIPT?start=1325437200&end=1325439000&prefix=alert"></script>
This example shows a message box in the browser with the service output, using
the browser's built-in alert function as the prefix. The JavaScript code
returned looks like:
alert ({ "available" : true })
Be careful when using JSONP. Because anyone can embed the script tag in their
web page, you can be tricked into executing the script when visiting a
malicious website, which can then capture returned data. Ensure JSONP scripts
are read-only and only return non-sensitive information.
Redirects
For security, content returned by the Content service is redirected to a
one-time URL at script.googleusercontent.com . If you use the Content service
to return data to another application, ensure the HTTP client is configured to
follow redirects. For the curl command-line utility, add the flag -L . Check
the documentation for your HTTP client for more information.
