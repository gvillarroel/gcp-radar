Page Summary
outlined_flag
Update incompatible APIs in your VBA code before converting files, especially for those with "Supported with workaround" or "Needs investigation" status.
For APIs with the status "Needs investigation" and containing specific critical operations like connecting to a database, converting the files might not be recommended.
Use the Macro Converter add-on in Google Drive to convert your Excel files to Apps Script files.
After converting, test your Apps Script code, including triggers, and review any generated ReadMe files for conversion issues.
If you encounter errors or unexpected results during testing, refer to the provided resources to fix the issues and retest your files.
Use the Macro Converter add-on to automatically convert
your Excel files with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code to
Sheets and Apps Script.
Before you begin
You might want to update incompatible APIs in your VBA code before you convert
your files. For files that have the status Supported exactly , you can proceed
to Step 1: Convert your files .
Modify incompatible VBA APIs
For files that have the status Supported with workaround or Needs
investigation , you can apply your workarounds and fixes after the conversion
in Apps Script, but we recommend that you modify the VBA code
that you're
familiar with first, before you convert your files.
For each API marked as Supported with workaround or Needs investigation in
the compatibility report, we recommend the following:
If the function performed by the API isn't critical to your VBA macro,
remove it from your VBA code. If the function is critical, change your code
to implement a similar behavior using supported VBA
APIs .
For Supported with workaround APIs, if you can't find a supported VBA
alternative, leave your VBA code as is. After conversion, look for
recommended workarounds in the Apps Script code comments.
If the issue is coming from an unimplemented language
construct ,
rewrite your code to avoid using those constructs.
For APIs with the status Needs investigation , check if your code contains
any of the following APIs:
Adodb.connection
CreateObject : This API is often used to connect to database and
enterprise resource planning software.
Shell.execute
OleObject
If your macros use these APIs, reconsider converting those files. These APIs
typically manage critical functions like database connectivity or local
system access that Apps Script cannot easily replicate.
Step 1: Convert your files
On your computer, open Google Drive .
On the right side panel, click the Macro Converter add-on
.
If you don't see the side panel, at the bottom right, click Show side panel
chevron_left .
Click Add files and folders . The Macro Converter only recognizes Excel files.
Choose the files or folders you want to convert and click Select . Select
fewer than 2,000 files at a time.
To change where your converted files are saved, click Change destination folder edit , and select the folder you want. Otherwise, the files are saved in your MyDrive folder.
Click Convert .
When the conversion completes, click View results .
Step 2: Test your converted files
After you convert your files, test them to make sure they function as expected.
Run your Apps Script code
After you convert your files, test the Apps Script functions.
Test the converted files with the data you normally use with your Excel files.
If possible, compare the output of your converted Google Sheets files with the
output of your original Excel files.
Test your triggers
If your files contain triggers like onOpen() , onEdit() , or onClick() , test
your triggers, too. Some VBA triggers won't convert automatically and need to be
addressed in Apps Script. See Address common
issues .
Review ReadMe files
If a ReadMe file was generated with your converted file, review the conversion
issues listed within the ReadMe file.
If the issues might be problematic for cases you haven't tested, apply the
recommended changes to your code.
If you've tested all possible scenarios and everything works as intended, you
probably don't need to make changes.
Step 3: Fix errors
If you run into errors while testing your files, see Fix errors in your
converted code .
If the code runs without errors, but the result isn't what you expected, open
the file's ReadMe file. Review each section to help determine what's causing the
issue and apply the recommended fix.
After you fix errors, test the file again to make sure everything works as
intended.
