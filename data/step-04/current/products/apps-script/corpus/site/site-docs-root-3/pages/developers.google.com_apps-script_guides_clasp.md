Page Summary
outlined_flag
Clasp is an open-source tool that allows you to develop and manage Apps Script projects from your terminal instead of the Apps Script editor.
With clasp, you can develop locally, manage deployment versions, and structure your code using directories.
To use clasp, you need Node.js version 4.7.4 or later installed, and you can install clasp globally using npm.
Common clasp operations include logging in and out, creating or cloning projects, downloading or uploading projects, managing versions and deployments, and opening the project in the Apps Script editor.
You can contribute to the clasp open-source project on GitHub.
To develop and manage Google Apps Script projects from your terminal rather
than the Apps Script editor, use the open-source tool clasp .
The clasp codelab provides an overview of all
clasp features.
Features
clasp includes the following features:
Develop locally
clasp lets you develop your Apps Script projects locally. Write
code on your own computer and upload it to Apps Script when
finished. You can also download existing Apps Script projects to
edit them offline. Use your favorite development tools like
git when building Apps Script
projects.
Manage deployment versions
Create, update, and view multiple deployments
of your project.
Structure code
clasp lets you organize your code into directories, which are preserved
when you upload them to script.google.com. For example:
# On script.google.com:
├── tests/slides.gs
└── tests/sheets.gs
# Locally:
├── tests/
│ ├─ slides.gs
│ └─ sheets.gs
Project types
You can use clasp to manage both standalone and container-bound script projects.
Standalone projects
A standalone project appears as a separate file in your Google Drive. You can
create a new standalone script using the clasp create command.
Container-bound projects
A container-bound project is attached to a
Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Google Forms
file. You can create a new container-bound script attached to a new file using
the clasp create command. You can also attach a new script to an existing file
using the --parentId flag.
Other project types
clasp also supports creating scripts for web apps and APIs.
Requirements
clasp is written in Node.js and distributed using
the npm tool. Prior to using clasp , you must have
Node.js version 20.0.0 or later installed.
Installing Node.js requires administrative privileges.
Installation
Once you've installed Node.js, use the following npm command to install
clasp :
npm install @google / clasp - g
After installation, use the clasp command from any directory on your computer.
Use clasp
Use clasp to handle a variety of tasks from the command line. This section
describes common operations to use when developing with clasp .
Login
This command logs in and authorizes management of your Google Account's
Apps Script projects. Once it is run, you are asked to sign into a Google
Account where your Apps Script projects are stored.
clasp login
Logout
This command logs out of the command-line tool. Re-login using clasp login to
re-authenticate with Google before continuing to use clasp .
clasp logout
Create a new Apps Script project
This command creates a new script in the current directory with an optional
script title.
clasp create [ scriptTitle ] [ --type <projectType> ] [ --parentId <parentId> ]
This command uses the following optional parameters:
scriptTitle : The title of the script project.
--type <projectType> : The type of project to create. Allowed values are
standalone , docs , sheets , slides , forms , webapp , and api .
--parentId <parentId> : The ID of the existing Google Drive file
(Docs, Sheets, Slides, or
Forms) to which the new script project should be bound.
This command also creates two files in the current directory:
A .clasp.json file storing the script ID.
An appsscript.json project manifest file containing project metadata.
Clone an existing project
This command clones an existing project in the current directory. The script
must be created or shared with your Google account. You specify the script
project to clone by providing its script ID. You can clone both standalone and
container-bound projects.
To find the Script ID of the project:
Open the Apps Script project.
At the left, click Project Settings
settings .
Under IDs , copy the Script ID .
clasp clone
Download a script project
This command downloads the Apps Script project from
Google Drive to your computer's file system.
clasp pull
Upload a script project
This command uploads all of a script project's files from your computer to
Drive.
clasp push
List project versions
This command lists the number and description of each of a script project's
versions.
clasp versions
Deploy a published project
Deploy script projects as web apps, Google Workspace add-ons, or executables. Create
deployments in the script editor, in the
project manifest , or using clasp .
To deploy a project with clasp , first create an immutable version of the
Apps Script project. A version is a "snapshot" of a script
project and is similar to a read-only branched release.
clasp version [ description ]
This command displays the newly created version number. Use that number to
deploy and undeploy instances of your project:
clasp deploy [ version ] [ description ]
clasp undeploy < deploymentId >
This command updates an existing deployment with a new version and description:
clasp redeploy <deploymentId> <version> <description>
List deployments
This command lists the script project's deployment IDs, versions, and their
descriptions.
clasp deployments
Open the project in the Apps Script editor
This command opens a script project in the Apps Script editor.
The editor launches as a new tab in your default web browser.
clasp open-script

CI/CD for Apps Script with clasp and GitHub Actions
This guide covers setting up automated linting, testing, and deployment for
Google Apps Script projects using clasp and GitHub Actions .
1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, complete the setup steps in Requirements .
You also need:
A GitHub repository.
The Apps Script API enabled at script.google.com/home/usersettings .
2. Authentication in CI
Since CI runners can't open a browser for OAuth, you store credentials as
GitHub Secrets :
Secret
Value
CLASPRC_JSON
Contents of ~/.clasprc.json (created by clasp login )
CLASP_JSON
Contents of .clasp.json (your script ID mapping)
The refresh token in .clasprc.json grants access to your Apps Script projects.
Treat it as a sensitive credential and rotate it periodically.
Add .clasprc.json and .clasp.json to your .gitignore . These contain
credentials and should never be committed.
3. CI Workflow — Lint and Test on PRs
.github/workflows/ci.yml :
name : CI
on :
pull_request :
branches : [ main ]
jobs :
check :
runs-on : ubuntu-latest
steps :
- uses : actions/checkout@v6.3
- uses : actions/setup-node@v6.3
with :
node-version : "20"
cache : npm
- run : npm ci
- run : npm run lint
4. CD Workflow — Deploy on Merge
.github/workflows/deploy.yml :
name : Deploy
on :
push :
branches : [ main ]
jobs :
deploy :
runs-on : ubuntu-latest
steps :
- uses : actions/checkout@v4
- uses : actions/setup-node@v4
with :
node-version : "20"
cache : npm
- run : npm ci
- run : npm run lint && npm test
- name : Setup clasp credentials
run : |
echo '${{ secrets.CLASPRC_JSON }}' > ~/.clasprc.json
echo '${{ secrets.CLASP_JSON }}' > .clasp.json
- name : Push and version
run : |
npx @google/clasp push --force
npx @google/clasp version "$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
The --force flag overwrites remote code without confirmation. Once this
pipeline is in place, avoid manual edits in the Apps Script editor — the
repository becomes the single source of truth.
5. Multi-Environment Deployment
For separate dev/staging/production environments, create a distinct Apps Script
project for each and store their configs as separate secrets ( CLASP_JSON_DEV ,
CLASP_JSON_STAGING , CLASP_JSON_PROD ). In the workflow, write the appropriate
secret to .clasp.json based on the branch being deployed.
Troubleshooting
Error
Fix
"Script API not enabled"
Enable at script.google.com/home/usersettings
"401 Unauthorized"
Re-run clasp login locally, update CLASPRC_JSON secret
"ENOENT .clasp.json"
Verify the credentials step writes the file before clasp push
Push succeeds but code unchanged
Confirm scriptId in the secret matches your target project
