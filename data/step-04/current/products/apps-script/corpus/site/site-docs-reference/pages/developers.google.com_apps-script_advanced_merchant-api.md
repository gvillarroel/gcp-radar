The Merchant API service allows you to utilize the Merchant API in Apps Script for uploading products and managing Merchant Center accounts.
To use the Merchant API service in Apps Script, you need to link your project to a standard Google Cloud project, enable the Apps Script Advanced service, and register your Cloud project with your Merchant Center account.
The Apps Script Advanced service for the Merchant API can be enabled either by modifying the appsscript.json manifest file or by adding the service through the Apps Script editor for existing projects or additional sub-APIs.
Code examples are provided for common tasks such as listing products, filtering disapproved products, retrieving reports, and listing data sources using the Merchant API service in Apps Script.
upload products and manage Merchant Center accounts.
The Merchant API service lets you use Merchant API in
Google Apps Script, to upload products and manage Merchant Center
accounts.
For detailed information about Merchant API, see the reference
documentation . Like all advanced services in
Apps Script, the Merchant API service uses the same objects,
methods, and parameters as the public API.
Merchant API is a collection of sub-APIs - groups of related services and
resources. Here's the list of sub-APIs .
To use the Merchant API service in Apps Script, follow these
steps:
Make sure that your Apps Script project is linked to a
standard Google Cloud project. For information, see Use a different
standard Cloud project .
Enable the Apps Script Advanced service, as described in
this document:
Enable appsscript.json for new projects.
Enable Apps Script for existing projects.
Register your standard Google Cloud project with your Merchant Center
account, as described in the Merchant API
quickstart guide.
Enable Apps Script Advanced service
You can enable the Apps Script service using either of the
following two methods:
Enable APIs in appsscript.json
Note: If you are using an existing Apps Script project, use the
Enable Apps Script for additional sub-APIs or existing
projects instructions.
The following example shows an appsscript.json file that enables the Products,
Accounts, Reports, and Data sources sub-APIs.
In the Apps Script editor, select Project Settings
settings .
Enable the Show "appsscript.json" manifest file in editor option.
In the editor, select the appsscript.json file.
Replace the contents of your appsscript.json file with the following:
{
"dependencies" : {
"enabledAdvancedServices" : [
{
"userSymbol" : "MerchantApiAccounts" ,
"version" : "accounts_v1" ,
"serviceId" : "merchantapi"
},
{
"userSymbol" : "MerchantApiDataSources" ,
"version" : "datasources_v1" ,
"serviceId" : "merchantapi"
},
{
"userSymbol" : "MerchantApiProducts" ,
"version" : "products_v1" ,
"serviceId" : "merchantapi"
},
{
"userSymbol" : "MerchantApiReports" ,
"version" : "reports_v1" ,
"serviceId" : "merchantapi"
}
]
},
"exceptionLogging" : "STACKDRIVER" ,
"runtimeVersion" : "V8"
} appsscrip t _v 1. jso n
Click Save .
You can now refer to the following sub-APIs within your code as:
a. MerchantApiAccounts
b. MerchantApiDataSources
c. MerchantApiProducts
d. MerchantApiReports
Enable Apps Script for additional sub-APIs or existing projects
To enable sub-APIs in existing projects, do the following:
Open your Apps Script project.
At the left, click Editor < > .
At the left, next to Services , click Add a service + .
Select the sub-API you want to enable within the version selector.
Append the identifier with name of your sub-API. For example, to enable the
Inventories sub-API, select version inventories_v1 and change the
identifier to MerchantApiInventories .
Warning: Each service must have a unique identifier. Always append the name
of the sub-API to the Identifier.
You can now refer to Inventories sub-API within your code as
MerchantApiInventories .
Sample code
This section explains how to use Merchant API for selected features.
List the products
This example demonstrates how to list the products for a given Merchant Center
account.
/**
* Lists all products for a given Merchant Center account .
*/
function productList () {
// IMPORTANT :
// Enable the Merchant API Products sub - API Advanced Service and call it
// "MerchantApiProducts"
// Replace this with your Merchant Center ID .
const accountId = '<MERCHANT_CENTER_ID>' ;
// Construct the parent name
const parent = 'accounts/' + accountId ;
try {
console . log ( 'Sending list Products request' );
let pageToken ;
// Set the page size to 1000. This is the maximum allowed page size .
let pageSize = 1000 ;
console . log ( 'Retrieved products below:' );
// Call the Products . list API method . Use the pageToken to iterate through
// all pages of results .
do {
response = MerchantApiProducts . Accounts . Products . list ( parent , { pageToken , pageSize });
console . log ( response );
pageToken = response . nextPageToken ;
} while ( pageToken ); // Exits when there is no next page token .
} catch ( e ) {
console . log ( 'ERROR!' );
console . log ( e );
}

Filter disapproved products
This example demonstrates how to filter disapproved products in a Merchant
Center account.
/**
* Demonstrates how to filter disapproved products using the Merchant API Reports service .
*/
function filterDisapprovedProducts () {
// IMPORTANT :
// Enable the Merchant API Reports sub - API Advanced Service and call it
// "MerchantApiReports"
// Enable the Merchant API Products sub - API Advanced Service and call it
// "MerchantApiProducts"
// Replace this with your Merchant Center ID .
const accountId = '<INSERT_MERCHANT_CENTER_ID>' ;
// Construct the parent name
const parent = 'accounts/' + accountId ;
try {
console . log ( 'Sending search Report request' );
// Set pageSize to the maximum value ( default : 1000 )
let pageSize = 1000 ;
let pageToken ;
// The query below is an example of a query for the productView that gets product informations
// for all disapproved products .
let query = 'SELECT offer_id,' +
'id,' +
'price,' +
'title' +
' FROM product_view' +
' WHERE aggregated_reporting_context_status = "NOT_ELIGIBLE_OR_DISAPPROVED"' ;
// Call the Reports . search API method . Use the pageToken to iterate through
// all pages of results .
do {
response =
MerchantApiReports . Accounts . Reports . search ({ query , pageSize , pageToken }, parent );
for ( const reportRow of response . results ) {
console . log ( "Printing data from Product View:" );
console . log ( reportRow );
// OPTIONALLY , you can get the full product details by calling the GetProduct method .
let productName = parent + "/products/" + reportRow . getProductView () . getId ();
product = MerchantApiProducts . Accounts . Products . get ( productName );
console . log ( product );
}
pageToken = response . nextPageToken ;
} while ( pageToken ); // Exits when there is no next page token .
} catch ( e ) {
console . log ( 'ERROR!' );
console . log ( 'Error message:' + e . message );
}
