App Hub overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
As you develop your cloud infrastructure, you might organize your Google Cloud
resources across multiple projects. You might also have many resources within
one or multiple projects that provide an integrated business function that you
want to group logically. The resource hierarchy in Google Cloud can make it
challenging to manage and organize your infrastructure for these grouping
purposes. App Hub provides an application-centric way to group and
manage services and workloads, helping you align your infrastructure with your
business functions.
App Hub acts as the foundational data model and central registry for
your applications on Google Cloud. It creates a single source of truth that
clarifies resource ownership, dependencies, and business context. This, in turn,
supports other Google Cloud products with the application-centric context they
need. For more information about this application-centric model and its
features, see Application-centric Google Cloud .
This document provides a conceptual overview of App Hub to help you
understand its capabilities and benefits before you set up or administer it.
Why use App Hub?
By shifting the focus from individual infrastructure resources to the
applications they form, App Hub helps you streamline governance and
operations at scale.
App Hub helps you implement the following application-centric
capabilities:
Streamline resource registration : Register at once multiple services and
workloads to an application. The limit for services and workloads that you
can register at a time is 10.
Organize and catalog your applications : Group scattered Google Cloud
resources from one or more projects into logical App Hub applications.
You can then find properties and categorize these applications with
attributes like owners, business criticality, and environment to improve
discoverability and accountability. For more information, see
Properties and attributes .
Create a unified view for your teams : By defining an application in
App Hub, you provide essential context to other Google Cloud
products. For example, you might enable the following features:
A central view of operations and insights in
Cloud Hub , which displays
alerts, incidents, and performance data in an application context.
AI-powered assistance from
Gemini Cloud Assist ,
which uses App Hub's data model to help you design, operate,
and troubleshoot your applications.
Application monitoring with
Google Cloud Observability
to help you troubleshoot errors and improve performance by displaying
telemetry data for your applications and their components.
Clarify ownership and dependencies : Understand how your applications are
composed and how their components depend on each other. This feature helps
developers and operators visualize application architecture, identify
owners, and resolve issues.
To learn more about how App Hub fits into the broader application
lifecycle, see Application-centric Google Cloud .
App Hub concepts and data model
App Hub is built on a data model based on the following key concepts:
applications, services, and workloads. These terms are common in the industry,
but App Hub uses them in a specific way.
The following table compares the App Hub definition with common
industry usage:
Concept
App Hub definition
Common industry usage
Application
A logical grouping of services and workloads that together deliver a
business function.
Can refer to a single deployable unit, a codebase, or a broad system.
Service
A network or API interface that exposes functionality to clients and
can route requests to workloads, such as a load balancer. Some
services, such as GKE clusters, are designated as
shared services that
you can register to multiple applications. This is indicated by their
registration type property .
Often refers to a microservice, a deployable component, or binary code
with its own business logic and data.
Workload
The compute resources where the binary deployments of your application
are installed. The application code from these resources performs a
discrete part of your business logic. For example, a workload can be a
GKE deployment or a Compute Engine managed instance
group (MIG) running the code of an AI agent.
A more general term for any process or component that consumes
computing resources.
For more information about these and other Application-centric Google Cloud central concepts, see
Key concepts . For a list of supported resources in
App Hub that you can register as services or workloads in your
applications, see
App Hub supported resources .
You can define App Hub applications based on your geographic
distribution requirements. Your location choice impacts which services and
workloads you can register in applications and can be important for data
residency requirements. You can designate the following locations:
Global applications: group services and workloads from multiple
Google Cloud regions.
Regional applications: group services and workloads that all reside
within a single region.
For a detailed comparison to help you choose the right location, see
Global and regional applications .
Services and workloads show a registration status in
your applications. Additionally, applications, services, and workloads can
contain metadata in the form of
properties and attributes .
You can view details of your deployed applications and their services and
workloads, including location, registration status, and metadata. For more
information, see
View details of services and workloads
and View application details .
Registration status of services and workloads
The organizational structure of your Google Cloud resources affects how
App Hub can manage services and workloads and lets you register
them in applications. Services and workloads that you can
register to an application have one of the
following registration status:
Discovered : Services and workloads that you can register to an
application because they are part of the
application management boundary and
that aren't registered to any other application or can be registered to
multiple applications. The discovered status also includes services and
workloads that you delete or unregister from an application but that you can
register again.
Note: Even if you have registered shared services to an application, they
can have a registration status of discovered in other applications.
Registered : Services and workloads registered to an application and
managed by App Hub. You can only register discovered services and
workloads. After you register the service or workload, the registration
status updates from discovered to registered .
Detached : Services or workloads that have been registered to an
application, but that App Hub can't manage or monitor because their
underlying Google Cloud resources are no longer part of the
application management boundary that you have defined. The registration status of
services and workloads registered to an application can change to detached
for the following reasons:
The underlying resource is deleted. For example, if you delete a
forwarding rule represented by a service, the service's registration
status changes to detached .
A project or folder containing underlying resources for registered
services or workloads is moved out of the application management boundary.
Detached services and workloads remain in the application until you
unregister them.
If you move a project out of the application management boundary, its detached
services and workloads can become discoverable for applications in a
different boundary. You can
register
discoverable services and workloads again, adhering to the
resource hierarchy
established by the application management boundary.
To select an application management boundary that fits your resource hierarchy in
Google Cloud and let App Hub discover and register the services and
workloads that your business needs, see
Choose your application setup model . To view the
registration status of services and workloads, see
View details of services and workloads .
Properties and attributes
To enrich the data model, App Hub lets you expose properties and
attributes to support application discoverability, accountability, and
governance. Defining these values as application metadata helps you filter,
manage, and apply policies to your application components at scale.
To view the properties and attributes of the services and workloads in your
applications, see
View details of services and workloads .
The following are the definitions and features of properties and attributes:
Properties are immutable fields that describe the underlying
infrastructure of a registered service or workload, such as the project ID,
location, or type. These are discovered automatically and cannot be edited
in App Hub. Key supported properties include:
( Preview )
Registration type : for services, an output-only property that
indicates if a service can be registered to one or multiple
applications. The following are the possible values for this property:
EXCLUSIVE : you can only register the service to a single
application.
SHARED : you can register the service to multiple applications.
This value indicates that the service is a
shared service .
To learn which services are shared or exclusive, see
the list of App Hub supported services .
( Preview )
Functional type : an output-only property that identifies the known
function of a service or workload. For example, when an AI agent is
deployed through a managed platform like
Vertex AI Agent Engine ,
App Hub automatically classifies the resource with the AGENT
functional type value to indicate that the workload runs an AI agent.
( Preview )
Extended metadata : an schema-driven property that provides rich,
structured information about the service or workload. It refers to a
key-value field that adds detailed, type-specific data. For example,
workloads with a functional type value of AGENT can include
apphub.googleapis.com/AgentProperties metadata, which contains
information about an agent that is compatible with the
Agent2Agent (A2A) Agent Card .
For a list of supported metadata types and their schemas, see
Extended metadata schemas .
To learn how to visualize this metadata, see
View extended metadata schemas .
( Preview )
Identity : an output-only property that contains the service account
or managed workload identity name for a service or workload.
Attributes are mutable, user-defined metadata that you can apply to
applications, services, and workloads to organize and govern them.
You can add attributes to applications, services, and workloads when you
create an application and register resources to it .
You can also
update service and workload attributes
and update application attributes .
Key attributes include:
Owners: Contact information for developer, operator, and business
teams. The supported owner types are:
developer_owners : Development team that owns development and
coding.
operator_owners : Operator team that ensures runtime and operations
integrity.
business_owners : Business team that ensures quality and user
expectations are met.
Criticality: The importance of the component to your business. The
supported values are:
MISSION_CRITICAL
HIGH
MEDIUM
LOW
Environment: The lifecycle stage of the component. The supported
values are:
PRODUCTION
STAGING
DEVELOPMENT
TEST
Note: You cannot set or modify attributes for shared services .
The App Hub resource model
To enable application-centric features, App Hub uses a resource model
centered on the concepts of the
management project and the
application management boundary .
Recommended:
Folder-level boundary :
If your components are organized within a Google Cloud folder structure, you
can use a folder as your boundary. This approach aligns your
application management boundary with your organization's structure by business unit,
environment, or team, and automatically includes all projects within that
folder.
( Preview )
Single-project boundary :
For small applications where all Google Cloud resources reside in one
project, you can designate that single project as your boundary.
This is the quickest way to get started with application management.
You can define single-project boundaries by configuring the
project as a standalone management project.
(Legacy) Multiple-project boundary with a host project : For
existing users, App Hub supports a legacy model where you can
designate a host project for application management by enabling the
App Hub API on a Google Cloud project. Then, you manually connect
other Google Cloud projects, known as service projects, to it for
multi-project resource discovery.
This application management layer that App Hub introduces on top of
your resource hierarchy in Google Cloud
lets App Hub discover supported resources
within the boundary. You can choose a setup model for applications and
set an application management boundary that best fits your resource hierarchy and
governance needs.
For information about data handling in this resource organization and other
application-centric features, see
Application-centric Google Cloud .
