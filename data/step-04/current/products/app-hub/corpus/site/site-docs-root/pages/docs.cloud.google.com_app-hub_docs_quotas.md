Quotas and limits
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document lists the quotas and system limits that apply to
App Hub.
Quotas have default values, but you can typically request
adjustments.
System limits are fixed values that can't be changed.
Google Cloud uses quotas to help ensure fairness and reduce
spikes in resource use and availability. A quota restricts how much of a
Google Cloud resource your Google Cloud project can use. Quotas
apply to a range of resource types, including hardware, software, and network
components. For example, quotas can restrict the number of API calls to a
service, the number of load balancers used concurrently by your project, or the
number of projects that you can create. Quotas protect the community of
Google Cloud users by preventing the overloading of services. Quotas also
help you to manage your own Google Cloud resources.
The Cloud Quotas system does the following:
Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services
Restricts your consumption of those resources
Provides a way to
request changes to the quota value
and automate quota adjustments
In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota
allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that
you're trying to perform fails.
Quotas generally apply at the Google Cloud project
level. Your use of a resource in one project doesn't affect
your available quota in another project. Within a Google Cloud project, quotas
are shared across all applications and IP addresses.
For more information, see the
Cloud Quotas overview .
Note: Quotas are the same for host projects and management projects. To
learn about the differences between these projects in App Hub,
see Key concepts .
There are also system limits on App Hub resources.
System limits can't be changed.
Allocation quotas
App Hub enforces the following usage limits:
Resource
Description
Limit
Scope
Service project
Maximum number of projects that can be attached to a host project.
25
Per host project
Regional applications
Maximum number of regional applications that can be created in a region in the host project or management project.
100
In a single region per host project or management project
Regional registered services
Maximum number of services that can be registered into a regional application in the host project or management project.
500
In a single region per application per host project or management project
Regional registered workloads
Maximum number of workloads that can be registered into a regional application in the host project or management project.
500
In a single region per application per host project or management project
Global applications
Maximum number of global applications that can be created in the host project or management project.
100
Per host project or management project
Global registered services
Maximum number of services that can be registered into a global application in the host project or management project.
500
Globally per application per host project or management project
Global registered workloads
Maximum number of workloads that can be registered into a global application in the host project or management project.
500
Globally per application per host project or management project
Rate quotas
The following quotas apply to App Hub requests:
Quota
Description
Value
Scope
API requests per minute
Maximum number of requests that can be made from a host project, management project, or service project. This is a project-wide aggregation of global and regional requests per minute.
12000
Per host project, service project, or management project
Regional API requests per minute
Maximum number of regional requests that can be made from a host project, management project, or service project.
1200
In a single region per host project or management project
API requests per minute
Maximum number of global requests that can be made from a host project, management project, or service project.
1200
Globally per host project or management project
Observability quotas
The following quotas apply to Google Cloud Observability features when used with
App Hub:
Resource
Description
Quota
Limit
Scope
Projects per metrics scope
The number of projects that can be included in a metrics scope for application monitoring.
375
3500
Per metrics scope
Note: When you use an app-enabled folder, App Hub attempts to
synchronize the projects in the folder with the metrics scope. If the number
of projects in your folder exceeds the metrics scope quota, some projects
might not be included, and you might not see all of your application's
metrics. You can request a quota increase for your metrics scope. For more
information, see
Metrics scopes for app-enabled folders .
Edit your quota
To adjust most quotas, use the Google Cloud console.
For more information, see
Request a quota adjustment .
