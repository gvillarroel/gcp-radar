Best practices for application management
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide provides best practices for designing, defining, and managing your
App Hub applications in
Application-centric Google Cloud , using
App Hub and
Application Design Center .
Following these practices is key to creating operable, governable, and
efficient applications that align with your business objectives.
Core principles of application management
Adhering to the following core principles helps you maximize the value you get
from managing your Google Cloud infrastructure in an application-centric
way:
Define clear boundaries: Set the
application management boundary in a
way that is logical for your operations, monitoring, governance, and
troubleshooting. Additionally, resources within this boundary that
you use as application components
should ideally share a joint operational lifecycle or business value to
simplify management and reduce risk.
For operational purposes, it's important to understand the difference
between an application management boundary and observability scopes .
The application management boundary defines the collection of projects that
contain the Google Cloud resources you can use to design, create, and
manage applications, as described in
Key concepts .
Observability scopes in Google Cloud Observability let you view telemetry from multiple
projects together.
Your log, metrics, and trace scopes should include data from the same
projects that are included in your application management boundary. For more
information about observability scopes, see
Configure observability scopes .
Reflect business capabilities: Define your applications around business
functions or end-to-end workflows, not just technical layers. An
application should represent a distinct value stream for your business.
Establish clear ownership and metadata: Assign clear
attributes to each
application to let teams effectively find, understand, and manage them in
App Hub. These attributes support discoverability and governance.
Discoverability means that relevant teams, such as developers and operators,
can find applications. Governance clearly defines who owns and is
accountable for each application.
In App Hub, you can define key attributes such as the following:
Environment: The stage in the application's lifecycle, such as
Production, Staging, Test, or Development. This attribute helps teams
filter and manage components based on their deployment stage.
Criticality: The business importance of the application and its
components, such as whether they are mission critical. This attribute
can inform monitoring and incident response priorities.
Owners: Contact information for the different teams responsible for
the application, which fosters accountability, streamlines
communication, and clarifies responsibilities.
Application Design Center supports these attributes and also includes
location and configuration details for application components. Consistently
applying those attributes and details is crucial for discovery, governance,
and reporting.
Design for evolution: Application Design Center helps you design for
evolution by letting you create reusable
templates for your applications. If
you update the underlying template, you can then apply those changes by
redeploying applications, which helps you meet demand, introduce new
features, or make architectural changes, accommodating future growth and
evolving infrastructure needs.
Iterate and refine application models: Regularly review and adjust your
application definitions to reflect changes in your organization's structure,
business priorities, and technical architecture. Cloud Hub provides
centralized views of available updates for applications deployed from
Application Design Center templates, helping you review and adjust your
application definitions to reflect these evolving needs.
Data model recommendations
By understanding how to model your real-world systems as applications, services,
and workloads within App Hub's framework , you
can effectively use application management capabilities in your Google Cloud
environment.
As you define your applications, it's important to apply the
core principles of application management , such as using
attributes to establish clear ownership and metadata.
To model your application components with this framework in mind, consider the
following examples of recommended use cases.
Example: Microservices-based application
An ecommerce system, such as the one described in the
OpenTelemetry demo for an
online store, is an example of a microservices-based application. We recommend
modeling this kind of system as a single application. This approach provides a
unified view of the entire business function, from product discovery to
checkout. For example, consider the following model for existing resources
running in Google Cloud:
Application: Create or define a single application in App Hub
named, for example, my-ecommerce-site . This application represents the
entire online store as a single, manageable unit. Register the following
resources to the application to create a logical grouping of components that
jointly delivers the business function of your online store:
Microservices as workloads: Register the individual microservices
that make up the ecommerce system, such as Ad , Cart , and
Checkout , as workloads within the application. These are the
compute resources with the binary code that perform a discrete part of
the business logic, running as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) deployments.
Network endpoints as services: Register the network endpoints for
these microservices, such as their load balancers, as services of the
application. These expose the online store functionality to clients.
Avoid registering each microservice as its own application. That approach
fragments the business context and makes it difficult to get a comprehensive
view of the health and performance of your online store.
By grouping all the microservices into a single application, you gain the
following benefits:
Comprehensive visibility: You can monitor the health and performance of
the entire ecommerce user journey, from the ad functionality to the checkout
functionality, in a single, unified view.
Clear business context: The application aligns the infrastructure with
the business function it serves, which is the online store. This approach
makes it easier to understand the health and cost of the application.
Simplified troubleshooting: When an issue arises, you can see the
dependencies between the different microservices within the application,
accelerating root cause analysis.
Example: Three-tier web application
A three-tier web application is an architectural pattern that separates an
application into a frontend tier, a backend tier, and a database tier. This use
case demonstrates how to model a complete business function as a single
application, rather than treating each tier as an isolated component.
The following model maps technical layers into a three-tier web application:
Application: Create a single application, for example, my-web-app , to
serve as the logical container for all the components that make up your web
application.
Services: Register the network interfaces that expose functionality to
other tiers or to users as services, for example:
The frontend load balancer that receives user traffic.
The internal load balancer that manages traffic between the frontend and
backend.
The Cloud SQL or Spanner database instance, which exposes a
data service to the backend logic tier.
Workloads: Register the compute resources that run your application's
code as workloads, for example:
The Managed Instance Groups (MIGs) or Google Kubernetes Engine deployments that
serve the frontend user interface.
The MIGs or Google Kubernetes Engine deployments that run the backend business
logic.
By grouping all three tiers into a single application, you gain the following
benefits:
Unified observability: You can monitor the health and performance of the
entire application from a single dashboard in
Application Monitoring ,
rather than having to piece together data from three separate applications.
Clear ownership: You can assign business, developer, and operator owners
to the my-web-app application, clarifying accountability for the entire
business function.
Simplified governance: You can apply policies and access controls at the
my-web-app level, supporting consistent governance across all tiers.
Application design and governance strategies
Adopt the following strategies to make sure your App Hub and
Application Design Center setup is scalable, governable, and aligned with your
operational practices.
Choose between global and regional applications
The location you choose for an application, either global or regional, is a
fundamental decision that impacts data handling, latency, and compliance:
Prioritize regional applications: Whenever possible, define your
applications as regional. This practice provides benefits like reduced
latency, potential cost savings, and alignment with data residency
requirements. Regional applications are recommended when all application
components reside within a single Google Cloud region, providing an
inherent compatibility with region-specific Google Cloud features and
failure domains. For guidance on building highly available systems, see
Build highly available systems through resource redundancy .
Use global applications strategically: Opt for a global application only
when your system's components are necessarily spread across multiple regions
or involve global Google Cloud resources, like a global external
Application Load Balancer.
Decompose multi-region systems: If you have resources in multiple
regions that don't form a single cohesive global function, consider
defining separate regional applications for components within each
respective region. This practice maximizes the benefits of regionalization
for each deployment.
For a detailed comparison between the different deployment geographies in
App Hub, see
Global and regional applications .
Separate environments into distinct applications
To support isolation for security, permissions, and operational risk, represent
different deployment environments, such as development, staging, and production,
as distinct applications. For example, you could structure your applications as
my-app-dev , my-app-staging , and my-app-prod .
Separating environments into distinct applications offers precise limits for
access control, policy enforcement, and monitoring. Additionally, consistently
using attributes, configuration details, and location on your application
components enhances discoverability and enforces governance. These attributes
provide rich metadata for filtering, reporting, and policy application. For
example, the Environment attribute provides granular detail and
resource-specific control for distinct deployment environment policies. For more
information on this and other attributes, see
Properties and attributes .
Align application management boundaries with team structures
Represent your organizational structure, specifically the teams responsible for
application development and operation, within your
application management boundaries .
This practice simplifies ownership and communication because the application
model mirrors the framework that your business uses to define how tasks are
divided, grouped, and coordinated to achieve its functions.
Follow the application lifecycle
Integrate App Hub with Application Design Center for a seamless
application lifecycle experience:
You have pre-existing resources to register in an application: Use
App Hub to register your existing Google Cloud resources as
services or workloads in applications. This practice provides unified
visibility and operational control over your current infrastructure quickly.
Optionally, you can later create a template in Application Design Center
from a running application to standardize the architecture for future
deployments.
You don't have pre-existing resources to register in an application: Use
Application Design Center to design and deploy new applications from
governed, reusable templates. When you deploy an application from an
Application Design Center template, the components are automatically
registered in App Hub so your application model accurately reflects
the intended design. Application Design Center also helps you manage
consistent application updates based on template revisions. If you update
the template, you can redeploy the application to propagate the changes,
supporting consistency and governance.
Resource hierarchy considerations
Your resource hierarchy in Google Cloud
is the foundation for practical application management. You introduce an
application management layer on top of that hierarchy through the configuration
of a management project to
define your application management boundary. For an overview of how different products
work together as part of Application-centric Google Cloud solutions, see
Application-centric Google Cloud .
Thoughtful planning of your Google Cloud resource hierarchy for application
management is essential to establishing logical groupings. Your choice of a
single project, a folder, or a set of projects to define your
application management boundary fundamentally shapes governance, policy enforcement, and
resource discovery. Moreover, Application-centric Google Cloud product support varies according to how
you define this application management boundary.
To define the best application management boundary for your resource hierarchy and
business needs and learn about product support for different resource structure
patterns, see Choose your application setup model .
Continuous refinement
Application designs are not static; they typically evolve with time. Regularly
review and refine your applications to make sure they continue to align with
your business functions, team structures, and changing architectures.
We recommend using insights from Cloud Hub and
Gemini Cloud Assist to identify
optimization opportunities and adapt your applications accordingly. Use
Application Design Center to model and deploy architectural changes and manage
the lifecycle of your applications through templates.
