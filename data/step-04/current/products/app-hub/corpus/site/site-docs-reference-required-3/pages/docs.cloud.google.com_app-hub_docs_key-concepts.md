This document explains the key terms and concepts related to
Application-centric Google Cloud .
Application (also, App Hub application)
A logical grouping of services and workloads that
together deliver a business function. In this grouping, services expose the
end-to-end business functionality that workloads provide. For example, you can
group all of the components that make up your online store or your chatbot into
a single application.
In App Hub, you define applications by grouping existing
Google Cloud resources as application components .
In Application Design Center, you define applications by creating,
customizing, and configuring an instance of an
application template called an application draft . You
can then deploy the application from that draft.
Learn about using App Design Center .
Application management boundary (also, boundary)
The collection of one or more Google Cloud projects or folders whose underlying
resources App Hub can discover and you can group in
applications . This collection defines the boundary where
App Hub can manage application components .
You define the configuration of this boundary. For example, you can
set the boundary to a single project or an entire folder of
projects. To learn which application setup model best fits your business needs,
see Choose your application setup model .
During setup, you define this boundary by creating
attachments within the management project .
App-enabled folder
A Google Cloud folder that you configure to act as an
application management boundary . This folder contains a
management project to manage the
applications within it.
Asset
In Application Design Center, a component that provides
supporting resources for an application, such as for managing access controls or
configurations. For example, an asset can be a service account that acts as an
identity to control access permissions for your application, or a
Secret Manager secret that you use to manage API keys securely.
To learn which resources you can add and configure as application components,
see the list of App Design Center supported assets .
Attachment
A persistent configuration that you create within a
management project to add a project or folder as a
member of the application management boundary .
You must attach a project or a folder to the management project to make them
part of the boundary. For single project and folder attachments,
App Hub automatically manages the integration to the
boundary. For all other attachments, you must create them manually.
Catalog
In Application Design Center, a collection of templates that you
can share between different spaces .
Component (also, application component)
A Google Cloud resource that you use to compose
an application. Components are categorized as services ,
workloads , or assets .
In App Hub, you discover resources within the
application management boundary that can function as services or
workloads. You can then register these resources as components of an
application.
In Application Design Center, you use components as building blocks to
create reusable application templates . You can then deploy
standardized application infrastructure from these templates.
Design canvas
In Application Design Center, the interface that you use to add
components and create an application diagram.
Draft (also, application draft)
In Application Design Center, an instance that you create from a
template . You can customize and deploy your application draft.
Host project (Legacy)
A Google Cloud project that you choose to act as the central management point
for App Hub applications. To make a project a host project, you
typically enable the App Hub API on this specific project and then
grant it permissions to access other projects.
After you've set up a host project, you manually connect other
Google Cloud projects, known as service projects , to it.
This connection is what allows App Hub to see and manage the resources
residing in those service projects, enabling you to group them into logical
applications within App Hub.
The host project is a legacy application setup model. In this legacy model, the
host project is equivalent to the management project , and
the collection of the host project and service projects serves as an example of
a multiple-project application management boundary .
Management project
A Google Cloud project that centralizes all application management tasks and
metadata. In the Google Cloud console, the management project of a folder-level
boundary has a unique icon ( ). In
this project you manage APIs, access control, billing, quotas, and define your
application management boundary .
To learn how to incorporate the management project in your Google Cloud
resource hierarchy, see
Choose your application setup model .
An application management boundary set to a single project is defined as a standalone
management project because you attach the project to itself for this
boundary type.
Service
An application component that refers to a network or API interface
that exposes functionality to clients. Services act as interfaces to
workloads . For example, a service can be a load balancer that
exposes a stable IP address and port, a Pub/Sub topic, or a
Vertex AI model.
App Hub supports two registration type ( RegistrationType ) property
values for services:
Exclusive ( EXCLUSIVE ): services that you can only register to one
application .
Shared ( SHARED ): services that you can register to multiple
applications .
Shared services support foundational infrastructure components like
GKE clusters that are inherently shared across multiple applications.
Even after being registered to an application, shared services can have a
discovered registration status
in App Hub for other applications to use them.
To learn which resources you can register as exclusive or shared services, see
the list of App Hub supported services .
To learn which resources you can add and configure as application components,
see the list of App Design Center supported services .
The registration type is an output-only field that you cannot modify. For more
information about the registration type property, see
Properties and attributes .
Service project (Legacy)
A Google Cloud project that contains application components your
applications use, such as virtual machines, Google Kubernetes Engine clusters, or
load balancers.
To let App Hub see and manage these resources, you must manually
connect this service project to a host project . A service
project can only be connected to one host project at a time.
The service project concept is part of a legacy model. In this model, the
combination of the host project and all of its connected
service projects forms a multiple-project
application management boundary .
Space
In Application Design Center, a dedicated area for a team to collaborate,
create templates , and deploy applications .
Template (also, application template)
In Application Design Center, a reusable and deployable architecture for an
application that you build using
application components .
Workload
An application component that provides compute resources to run
the binary deployments and code for a discrete part of an application's business
logic. For example, a workload for an ecommerce application might handle payment
processing and run as a Google Kubernetes Engine deployment or a Compute Engine managed
instance group (MIG). A workload for an AI agent might have functional type and
extended metadata properties .
To learn which resources you can register as workloads, see
the list of App Hub supported workloads .
To learn which resources you can add and configure as application components,
see the list of App Design Center supported workloads .
