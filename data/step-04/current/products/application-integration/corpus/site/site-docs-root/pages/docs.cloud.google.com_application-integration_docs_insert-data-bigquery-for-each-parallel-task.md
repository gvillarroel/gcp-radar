Insert data into BigQuery using a For Each Parallel task
In this tutorial you'll create an Application Integration and a sub-integration to process a series of records. For each record, the main integration asynchronously invokes the sub-integration, which takes the data for each record and inserts it as a row in a table in a BigQuery dataset.
In this tutorial, you'll complete the following tasks:
Set up a BigQuery connection
Set up a sub-integration
Set up the main integration
Test your integration
Before you begin
Ensure that you have access to Application Integration.
Do the following in your Google Cloud project:
Grant the following roles to the service account that you want to use to create the connection:
roles/bigquery.dataEditor
roles/bigquery.readSessionUser
roles/secretmanager.viewer
roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
Enable the following services:
secretmanager.googleapis.com (Secret Manager API)
connectors.googleapis.com (Connectors API)
If these services have not been enabled for your project previously, you are prompted to enable them
when creating the connection in the Create Connection page.
Set up a BigQuery connection
Start by creating the BigQuery dataset and table to use in this tutorial. After you've created the dataset and table, create a BigQuery connection. You'll use this connection in an integration later on in this tutorial.
Set up a BigQuery dataset and table
To set up your BigQuery dataset and table, perform the following steps:
In the Cloud console page,
select your Google Cloud project.
To launch a Cloud Shell session from the Google Cloud console,
click the
Activate Cloud Shell icon in the
Cloud console . This launches a
session in the bottom pane of Google Cloud console.
To enable BigQuery APIs, enter the following commands in your Cloud Shell terminal:
export PROJECT_ID= project_id
export REGION= region
gcloud services enable --project "${PROJECT_ID}" \
bigquery.googleapis.com \
bigquerystorage.googleapis.com
In this command, replace:
project_id with the project ID of your Google Cloud project.
region with the region that you want to use to create your BigQuery dataset.
To create a BigQuery dataset with the name bq_tutorial , enter the following command in your Cloud Shell terminal:
bq --project_id ${PROJECT_ID} --location ${REGION} mk bq_tutorial
To create a BigQuery table with the name tutorial , enter the following command in your Cloud Shell terminal:
