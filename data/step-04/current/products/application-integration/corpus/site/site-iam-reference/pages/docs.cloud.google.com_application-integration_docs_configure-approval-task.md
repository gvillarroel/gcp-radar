Approval Task
The Approval task lets you configure approval-based integrations. It also lets you control the flow of an integration.
You can use the Approval task to send approval request emails to one or more integration users. The email includes a link to the integration where the users can manually approve or reject the request.
During an integration execution, when the control reaches the Approval task, execution is halted, and all tasks after the Approval task are suspended.
The integration resumes the execution only when a user manually approves or rejects the approval request.
An Approval task can be used for the following purposes:
To suspend and branch an integration based on user approval or rejection.
To suspend an integration until a specified duration.
To use as a breakpoint to debug the integration.
Compare Approval task, Suspend task, and Timer task
All the three ( Approval ,
Suspend ,
and Timer ) tasks perform a similar
function of pausing and resuming an integration. However, there are subtle differences
among them. The following table describes the differences amongst the three tasks.
Approval task
Suspend task
Timer task
Doesn't support automatic resumption of an integration and requires
manual intervention to resume the integration.
Supports both manual and automatic resumption of an integration. If there is no
manual intervention to revoke the suspension, the integration will automatically
resume execution after the expiry of the suspension time limit.
Supports only automatic resumption of an integration. The integration execution
automatically resumes after the exipry of the suspension time limit.
Can't resume an integration via an API call. You must manually resolve the
suspension by using the Integrations UI.
Can resume an integration by using the Suspensions API for integrations.
Supports only automatic resumption of an integration.
Users receive notification when an integration pauses (suspended).
Users don't receive any notification when an integration pauses (suspended).
Users don't receive any notification when an integration pauses (suspended).
Supports a output variable (boolean), which allows you to perform conditional checks
before resuming an integration. However, the output variable can only have
the value as either true or false .
Supports a output variable (string), which allows you to perform conditional checks
before resuming an integration. You can set any value to the output variable.
Doesn't support any output variables.
Configure the Approval task
To configure the Approval task:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Application Integration page.
Go to Application Integration
In the navigation menu, click Integrations .
The Integrations page appears listing all the integrations available in the Google Cloud project.
Select an existing integration or click Create integration to create a new one.
If you are creating a new integration:
Enter a name and description in the Create Integration pane.
Select a region for the integration.
Note: The Regions dropdown only lists the regions provisioned in your Google Cloud project. To provision a new region, click Enable Region . See Enable new region for more information.
Select a service account for the integration. You can change or update the service account details of an integration any time from the info Integration summary pane in the integration toolbar.
Note: The option to select a service account is displayed only if you have enabled integration governance for the selected region.
Click Create . The newly created integration opens in the integration editor .
In the integration editor navigation bar, click Tasks to view the list of available tasks and connectors.
Click and place the Approval task element in the integration editor.
Click the Approval task element on the designer to view the Approval task
configuration pane.
Configure the displayed fields using the Configuration properties for the task
as detailed in the table below.
All changes to the properties are saved automatically.
Configuration properties
The following table describes the configuration properties of the Approval task.
Property
Data type
Description
Recipients
String Array
Email addresses to which notification is sent when the task is suspended. Enter multiple
email addresses separated by a comma.
Note: In your Google Cloud project, you must grant the Application Integration Approver IAM role to all the email addresses provided in the Recipients field. For information on granting IAM roles, see Granting, changing, and revoking access .
Custom notification message
String
Custom message to include in the email notification when the task is suspended. The value
can be a literal or a variable. If the custom message is available in a variable,
click VAR and select the variable.
Reminder frequency (in hours)
Integer
Frequency of reminder notifications.
If the suspension is in an unresolved state, you can send reminder email notifications requesting authorized users to resolve the suspension.
Time until expiration (in hours)
Integer
Time period of the suspension.
If the suspension is not resolved within the time limit, the suspension is rejected by default.
On expiration
Boolean
Action to be taken after the suspension has expired.
You can choose either to reject the suspension or lift the suspension. By default the suspension is rejected.
isApproved (Approval)
Boolean
Output variable which has the status of the suspension after resolution.
The isApproved variable is set to True if the suspension is approved and set to False if the
suspension is rejected.
Tip: Use the isApproved variable when specifying edge conditions for subsequent tasks to control the flow of the integration.
For more information about edge conditions, see Edges conditions .
Following is a sample edge condition configured using the isApproved variable:
$ TASK_ID _isApproved$ = TRUE
Error handling strategy
An error handling strategy for a task specifies the action to take if the task fails due to a temporary error . For information about how to use an error handling strategy, and to know about the different types of error handling strategies, see Error handling strategies .
