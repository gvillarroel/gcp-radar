Salesforce trigger
The Salesforce trigger lets you listen to either
Change Data Capture (CDC) or
Enterprise Messaging Platform events.
With this trigger, you can start your integration based on any of the CDC events (Create, Update,
Delete, or Undelete) or the platform events in your Salesforce instance.
For more information, see the following tutorials:
To use Application Integration to automate the business process flow of routing and assigning a Salesforce customer case, see the Automate Salesforce case routing assignments tutorial.
To use Application Integration to automate an order management flow between a customer relationship management (CRM) application and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) application, see the Automate Salesforce opportunity to BigQuery order tutorial.
To use the Salesforce trigger to invoke an integration in Application Integration for a Salesforce Change Data Capture (CDC) event, see the Invoke an integration for a Salesforce Change Data Capture (CDC) event tutorial.
Before you begin
This section outlines the steps required to connect and configure a Salesforce instance to use
Change Data Capture (CDC) or
Platform events to stream changes to your Application Integration
in a pub/sub manner. The following steps must be completed before configuring any Salesforce-related
task or trigger in Application Integration:
Set up an integration user
Configure a permission set
Set up a security token
Create a connected app
Note : To complete these steps, system administration access to your Salesforce instance
is required. If you do not have admin access, share these
instructions with your Salesforce Administrator.
This tutorial provides in-depth instruction, but we recommend that you have some understanding of
Salesforce configuration options. Salesforce provides detailed
Developer Documentation to help you get started.
Set up an integration user
Note : If you already have an integration user and you know the password, you can skip to the next step.
If you need to reset the password, see Step 6 below.
Set up an integration user with the following steps:
Log in to your Salesforce instance with your sysadmin credentials.
Click the Gear icon and then select Setup , as shown in the image below:
Click Users > Users from the Administration menu .
From the Users pane, select the New User button.
In the User Edit dialog, fill in the following details:
First Name : First name of the integration user.
Last Name : Last name of the integration user.
Email Address : Email for the integration user. Ideally, this should be a group email.
Username : User name that complies with any org-level naming conventions.
If you are creating a new integration user, use the following format:
EMAIL . SALESFORCE_ORG_NAME . SANDBOX_NAME
If you have an existing integration user, confirm that the username is entered here.
Role : Select from the dropdown of options.
User License : Enter Salesforce or, if using a trial org, enter Salesforce Platform .
Profile : Select the permissions profile for integration users from the dropdown.
We recommend assigning a profile with no permissions , to protect your integration user
Salesforce access from unauthorized usage.
Click Save .
To update the password for the new integration user, follow these steps:
Click the Reset password(s) button on the Users pane. A password reset email is sent
to the email address associated with the user.
Note : Confirm that you have access to the email account associated with the integration user before triggering the
reset password flow. In addition, if you have if you have SSO enabled for this user, you will not be able to reset the password.
To enable the reset option, go to Profile > System Permissions and uncheck the option for SSO Login Enabled.
Follow the reset password flow from the email account. Take note of the new password , as you will need it for a later step.
Configure a Permission Set
If you have already have access to a Permission Set that is appropriate for an integration user, you can skip this
step and proceed to Set up a security token . Otherwise, follow these steps to configure a Permission Set for the integration user and the Salesforce object.
To configure a Permission Set for the integration user:
From the Setup menu, click Users > Permission Sets .
In the Permission Sets pane, click the New button.
In the Permission Sets dialog, enter the following details:
Label : Enter a name for the Permission Set.
License : Select Salesforce from the License dropdown.
Click Save .
From the list of System setting options, scroll down and select System Permissions
On the System Permissions page, click the Edit button.
Scroll down the list of available permissions and select the API Enabled checkbox.
The Api Only User permission is also required, but cannot be enabled until the required security token
is reset. This permission is added in a later step.
(Optional) Scroll and select Modify All Data and View All Data , if applicable.
These permissions are not required, but can be helpful if you want to automatically give the integration user access to new objects. We recommend
only enabling these permissions for testing in a sandbox.
Scroll to the top of the permissions list and click Save .
Confirm your settings and click Save .
To configure the Permission Set for the Salesforce object:
Click Permission Set Overview to return to the main Permissions Set configuration page.
Select Object Settings from the Apps section of the Permissions Set pane.
Scroll down and select the Salesforce object(s) requiring a Permission Set.
This example uses the Opportunity object.
NOTE: CDC only supports a subset of standard Salesforce objects.
To learn more, see: Change Event Object Support .
Click the Edit button on the object detail page.
Select the checkboxes for record types If you know which record
types are required select those. If you don't know which record types are required, select them all.
Select the checkboxes for the Object Permissions to enable.
Read and View All are recommended.
Grant Read Access or Edit Access for each object field by selecting the corresponding
checkbox.
Note : Write access is not required for use with CDC.
Scroll to the top of the page and click Save .
Set up a Security Token
If you have created a security token for the integration user previously, and reset the password,
an email with a new security token is sent automatically. You can use the new token and skip to Create a connected app .
Otherwise, use the following steps to reset the security token for the integration user:
Log in to Salesforce as the integration user, using the username and password set in a previous step.
From the main menu, click the profile picture, then click Settings .
From the Settings menu, select Reset My Security Token to open the Reset Security Token pane.
Click the Reset Security Token button.
Check the email account associated with the integration user for an email containing the new security token.
Take note of the new security token , as you will need it for a later step.
(Optional) Enable the Api User Only permission in System Permissions for your permission set, as described
in Configure a permission set above.
Create a Connected App
System administration permission is required to set up a Connected App. If you are currently logged
in as the integration users, make sure to log out and then log in again as sysadmin .
Follow these steps to set up a Connected App:
Click the Gear icon and then select Setup .
From the Setup menu, search for and select App Manager , as shown in the image below:
Click New Connected App .
In the configuration pane, provide the following details:
Connected App Name : Enter a name for your connected app.
API Name : Enter the name of the API.
Contact email : Enter an email for your connected app, ideally a group email alias.
API (Enable OAuth Settings) : Select Enable OAuth Settings . Then, set the following:
Callback URL : This is only required if the you want an external service to receive the OAuth authorization response (for example, authorization codes or tokens) and perform validation.
If you do choose to provide a callback, make sure to include the http(s):// prefix.
Selected OAuth Scopes : Select:
Access and manage your data (api)
Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)
Note: If you are using OAuth authentication, you must install the connected app in your Salesforce account after creating the trigger. For details, see Install the OAuth connected app .
Click Save .
Note : Your newly created connected app will not work for the initial 2-10 minutes after creation.
Click Continue . You need to re-authorize with a verification code that is sent to your email address.
After successfully verifying the code, a consumer secret and a consumer key are displayed on the next page. Make a note of these values,
as they will be used when setting up the Auth Module for Application Integration.
Click the Manage button.
Once on the Connected App Detail page, click the Edit Policies button.
In the OAuth Policies section, change the value in the Permitted Users dropdown
to Admin approved users are pre-authorized .
Click Save .
Scroll to the Profiles and Permission Sets section of the page to select the profile or
Permission Set you want to apply to the connected app.
You can select either a profile or a Permission Set, or a mixture of both, which will allow users
with either the correct profile or Permission Set to access the connected app.
Select the desired profile or Permission Set.
Click Save .
Prerequisite steps to use CDC events
Before configuring your Application Integration trigger to use CDC events, make sure to
add a configured object to CDC in Salesforce:
Log in to Salesforce as a sysadmin .
Click the Gear icon, then click Setup .
Using the left nav, search for and select Change Data Capture .
On the Change Data Capture setup page, locate the Salesforce object you'd like to use in the
Available Entities column and drag it to the Selected Entities column.
Note : A maximum of 5 objects per Salesforce license can be selected for CDC.
Contact your Salesforce representative for more information and licensing options.
Click Save .
Prerequisite steps to use Platform events
Before configuring your Application Integration trigger to use Platform events, complete the following
steps in Salesforce:
Create a Platform Event
Update permissions for the Platform Event
Create a Platform event
To create a Platform event, perform the following steps:
Log in to your Salesforce instance with your sysadmin credentials.
Click the Gear icon and then select Setup .
In the navigation pane, search for Platform and then click Platform events .
In the Platform events page, click New Platform Event and set the following properties:
Label
Plural Label
Object Name (This field is automatically populated)
Publish Behavior
Select any one of the following values:
Publish After Commit : Reverts streaming of events if a condition isn't met.
Publish Immediately : Instantly triggers the event, without waiting for any validation.
For more information about the publishing behavior, see
Platform events and Transactions .
Deployment Status (Optional): Select Deployed if the event is ready for deployment.
Click Save .
Create custom fields.
To create the custom fields, click New in the Custom Fields and Relationships section
and select the type of custom field. You can create as many custom fields as required.
After creating the custom fields, in the Platform events page, notice the value of the
API Name field. The object name ends with _e , which means that the object is a
Platform Event object. For a CDC object, the object name ends with _c .
Update permissions for the Platform Event
The permissions set must be updated to let the integration user access the newly created Platform Event.
To update the permissions, perform the following steps:
From the Setup menu, click Users > Permission Sets .
In the Permission Sets page, click the previously created permission.
Click Object Settings > Plural Label of the Platform Event .
In the Object Permissions section, enable the Read and Create permissions.

the trigger configuration pane.
Select a Salesforce instance from the Salesforce instance configuration drop-down.
If you do not have a Salesforce instance, create a new instance. For more information, see
Create a new Salesforce instance .
Select a Salesforce channel from the Salesforce channel configuration drop-down.
If you do not have a Salesforce channel, create a new channel. For more information, see
Create a new Salesforce channel .
If you have chosen the event type as CDC , select any one of the
following operations:
Create
Update
Delete
Undelete
The trigger runs only if the specific operation or gap operation occurs.
The Salesforce trigger can be configured for only one operation.
If you want to run the trigger for multiple operations, create a
Salesforce trigger for each operation.
Create a new Salesforce instance
To configure a new Salesforce instance, perform the following steps:
In the editable properties of the trigger, click Select a Salesforce
instance configuration > + Add new Salesforce instance configuration .
In the Add Salesforce instance configuration dialog, set the following properties:
Salesforce instance connection name : Enter a name for the instance.
After configuration, you will use this name to refer to the Salesforce instance.
Salesforce domain : Enter a service authority for the instance. You can find the domain in your Salesforce account. For example,
instance.my.salesforce.com . The following image shows the Salesforce domain:
Authentication profile : Select an authentication profile.
If you don't have an authentication profile, create a new profile of the
OAuth 2.0 resource owner password credentials authentication type.
For information about the fields, see OAuth 2.0 resource owner password credentials .
For the Salesforce instance, enter the following values:
Client ID: enter the consumer key that you noted when you set up a connected app .
Secret: enter the consumer secret that you noted when you set up a connected app .
Password: Enter the user password with the USER_PASSWORD SECURITY_TOKEN format. Replace the following:
USER_PASSWORD : the Salesforce user password.
SECURITY_TOKEN : the security token that you set for your integration.
For example, if your USER_PASSWORD is test-password and SECURITY_TOKEN is 737K27NCa3O6 , then your password will be test-password737K27NCa3O6 .
The following image shows the fields required to create an authentication profile:
Salesforce Organization ID : Enter the org id of the salesforce instance.
You can get the ID from your Salesforce administrator.
Click Add .

To configure a new Salesforce channel, perform the following steps:
In the editable properties of the trigger, click Select a Salesforce
channel configuration > + Add new Salesforce channel configuration .
In the Add Salesforce channel configuration dialog, enter the object name
for the Salesforce object name property.
For the list of Saleforce objects, see Standard objects in Salesforce . If unsure of the object name, contact your Salesforce administrator.
Click Add .
Install the OAuth 2.0 connected app
As part of a security enhancement, Salesforce now requires all connected apps using OAuth 2.0 authentication to be installed.
This applies to both new and existing triggers. This change means your existing trigger might stop working unless the connected app is installed in Salesforce.
Navigate to the Connected Apps OAuth Usage page in your Salesforce account and install the app.
For more information, see Connected App Usage Restrictions Change .
Output variables
The response from the Salesforce trigger is available to you in the output variables.
The output variables for a CDC event are described in the following table:
Variable
Data type
Description
SalesforceTriggerCdcPayload
JSON
Details of the change event.
SalesforceTriggerEvent
JSON
Contains replayId of the event.
SalesforceTriggerSchema

SalesforceTriggerCdcSnapshot
JSON
Snapshot of the object after the change event. This field is available only for
Update and Create operations.
SalesforceTriggerCdcRecordId
String
Contains the recordId of the updated or added record. The recordId is an
identifier of the changed Salesforce object.
The output variables for a Platform event are described in the following table:
Variable
Data type
Description
SalesforceTriggerPEPayload
JSON
Details of the change event.
SalesforceTriggerEvent
JSON
Contains replayId of the event.
SalesforceTriggerSchema
String
Trigger schema.
The output parameter for this trigger is the CdcTriggerPayload JSON variable. The JSON
variable contains updated record objects.
Best practices
Using the Salesforce trigger is recommended in cases where you want to use Salesforce notifications
to trigger integrations without writing custom code to publish Salesforce events. Any small field change in your Salesforce case will trigger a Salesforce CDC event, and thus trigger an integration, which can result in significant integration noise . Consider using Change event filters to filter only the required CDC events that trigger the integration. Using Change event filters can help reduce integration noise and ensure compliance
with your license limitations.
Similarly, we recommend unpublishing any integration using this trigger when the integration is no longer needed.
Until it is unpublished or deleted, the integration will continue to listen for Salesforce CDC and Platform events.
Considerations
Before using the Salesforce trigger to run your integration, consider the following:
Salesforce sends a maximum of 100k CDC and Platform events per day. If you buy more
platform event capacity from Salesforce, you can publish over 10 million events per day. For more information,
see Platform Event Allocation . Contact your Salesforce
administrator to understand your license restrictions before choosing CDC events for your
integration trigger.
Note : Multiple integrations using the same Salesforce Channel will not
double your Salesforce quota consumption.
If you are planning bulk uploads to Salesforce, consider pausing CDC to reduce integration noise and ensure compliance
with your license limitations.
The maximum event message size that Salesforce can publish is 1 MB. For more information,
see Change Data Capture Allocations .
Application Integration does not support Salesforce CDC events for the following regions:
asia-northeast1
asia-south1
australia-southeast1
europe-west2
europe-west3
europe-west6
northamerica-northeast1
southamerica-east1
us-east4
us-west2
SLA exclusions
The Salesforce trigger is dependent on the Salesforce
product. As this dependency is external to the Application Integration, the Application Integration
Service Level Agreement (SLA) terms and conditions are applicable only when the
Salesforce trigger successfully starts the execution of an active integration.
Pricing
The Cloud Pub/Sub trigger and Salesforce trigger don't require you to create a connector . However, if you use the Connectors task to connect to Pub/Sub or Salesforce, then you are billed for the connector usage. For information about pricing, see Application Integration pricing .
