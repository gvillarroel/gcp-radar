Apps Script task
The Apps Script task lets you run Google Apps Script from your integration.
Google Apps Script is a rapid application development platform that makes it fast and
easy to create business applications. For more information,
see Google Apps Script .
This task is useful when you want to run custom scripts or reuse existing scripts in your integration.
Note : The Apps Script task is a non-regional global service.
Before you begin
Before using the Apps Script task, make sure you complete the following steps:
Enable AppsScript API
Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
Set up an authentication profile
Ensure that VPC Service Controls is NOT setup for Application Integration in your Google Cloud project.
Warning: Cloud Function does not function or stops functioning if VPC Service Controls is set up for Application Integration in your Google Cloud project.
Enable AppsScript API
You must enable the AppsScript API in your Google Cloud project and your AppsScript user account to
use this task. For information about enabling the AppsScript API in your Google Cloud project,
see Enabling an API in a standard Google Cloud project .
To enable the API in your user account, click Settings and set
Google Apps Script API to On .
Create OAuth 2.0 client ID
If you have an OAuth 2.0 client ID available, you can skip this step and proceed to
Set up an authentication profile .
For information about creating a new OAuth client ID, see Create OAuth client ID .
Set up an authentication profile
Application Integration uses the authentication profile to connect to Google Cloud for deploying and
running the Apps Script project. To set up an authentication profile, perform the following steps:
Add the Apps Script task
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Application Integration page.
Go to Application Integration
In the navigation menu, click Integrations .
The Integrations page appears listing all the integrations available in the Google Cloud project.
Select an existing integration or click Create integration to create a new one.
If you are creating a new integration:
Enter a name and description in the Create Integration pane.
Select a region for the integration.
Note: The Regions dropdown only lists the regions provisioned in your Google Cloud project. To provision a new region, click Enable Region . See Enable new region for more information.
Select a service account for the integration. You can change or update the service account details of an integration any time from the info Integration summary pane in the integration toolbar.
Note: The option to select a service account is displayed only if you have enabled integration governance for the selected region.
Click Create . The newly created integration opens in the integration editor .
In the integration editor navigation bar, click Tasks to view the list of available tasks and connectors.
Click and place the Apps Script element in the integration editor.
Create an authentication profile
Click the Apps Script element on the designer to view the Apps Script
task configuration pane.
In the task configuration pane of the Apps Script task, click +New authentication profile .
In the Authentication profile dialog, enter a name and description for the profile and set the following properties:
Authentication type : Select OAuth 2.0 authorization code
Authentication endpoint : Enter https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
Token endpoint : Enter https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
Client ID : Enter the client ID.
The Client ID is available in your Google Cloud project dashboard
under Credentials > OAuth 2.0 Client IDs .
Secret : Enter the client secret
The client secret is available in your Google Cloud project dashboard
under Credentials > OAuth 2.0 Client IDs .
Scope(s) : Enter the following:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.projects
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.deployments
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.deployments.readonly
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.scripts
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
Note : Multiple scopes can be separated by a single space character (" ").
Click Generate Access Token and Save .
You are redirected to an authorization screen. Log in and provide consent to
the permissions listed on the screen to generate your access token. If the generation of the
access token is successful, your authentication profile is saved, and you
can continue to edit your integration.
Note : The same user must create both the authentication profile and deploy
the Apps Script. If the users are different, the Apps Script does
not run.
Configure the Apps Script task
To configure an Apps Script project in the Apps Script task,
perform the following steps:
In the task configuration pane,
click Configure Apps Script Project.
The Apps Script Configuration dialog appears.
You can choose to link to
an existing Apps Script project or create a new Apps Script project.
Configuring an Apps Script project associates the Apps Script project with your integration in Application Integration.
Click Save.
Click Open Apps Script Project .
In the Apps Script editor, you can see the following files:
Run.gs : Contains the executable code.
Write your script inside the run function.
This function is called when the Apps Script task executes.
In your script, you can use the variables defined at the integration level.
For information on using the integration variables,
see Using integration variables .
Main.gs : Contains the initialization code to run
Apps Script from your integration. Do not edit or modify this file.
Test.gs : Contains the executable code for test runs.
You can write your script inside the testRun function to test the script .
Make sure to deploy the project in Web apps format. For
more information on the various deployment modes, see
Create and manage deployments .
Access integration variables
The Apps Script task uses the AppsScriptTask library, which enables you to
use integration variables in your script. The AppsScriptTask
library is automatically imported and is available for use in the run
function.
To access an integration variable in your Apps Script, you must pass the
variable in the form of task parameters to the Apps Script task. The task parameters are
key-value pairs where Key is the name of the variable
in your AppsScript task and the Value is the corresponding integration variable name.
You can add one or more task parameters in the Task Parameters section of the task
configuration pane.
For example, if you have an integration variable named Product that you
want to use in your Apps Script, you can define Key as
ProductKey and the value as Product . In your
Apps Script, you can then use AppsScriptTask.getTaskParameter(' ProductKey ')
to read the Product variable.
Note : To use an integration variable in your AppsScript,
the variable must be added as a task parameter to the Apps Script task.
The AppsScriptTask library provides the following methods to
access integration variables:
setIntegrationVariable
getTaskParameter
Function name
Description
Usage
setIntegrationVariable
Sets the provided value to the variable.
Syntax: setIntegrationVariable(value,value)
Example:
// Write to an Integer variable
AppsScriptTask . setIntegrationVariable ( ' EmployeeIDKey ' , '456' );
getTaskParameter
Gets the value of a variable.
Syntax: getTaskParameter(value)
Example:
// Read an integration variable
AppsScriptTask . getTaskParameter ( ' EmployeeIDKey ' );
To view all the functions available in the AppsScriptTask library, hover over the
AppsScriptTask menu item in your
Apps Script editor, click More
more_vert > Open in a new tab .
Test your Apps Script
Before publishing your integration, you can test your script using the testRun function
available in the Test.gs file.
Write your test code in the testRun function, using
the AppsScriptTaskTest library. This library lets you run assertion-based
test cases and is automatically imported for use in the testRun function.
To view all the functions available in the AppsScriptTaskTest library, hover over
the AppsScriptTaskTest menu item in your
Apps Script editor, click More
more_vert > Open in a new tab .
The following sample shows the usage of AppsScriptTaskTest library functions.
function testRun (){
// Create a new request
let req = AppsScriptTaskTest . createNewTestRequest ( 'myCustomTest' );
// Add a task parameter that references an integration variable with the value 5
AppsScriptTaskTest . setIntegrationVariableAndCreateReference ( req , 'input' , '$input$' , 5 );
// Add a task parameter that references an integration variable
AppsScriptTaskTest . createReference ( req , 'output' , '$output$' );
// Run the task ( assuming the task increments the input by 1 ) and get the response
let res = AppsScriptTaskTest . runTest ( req , executeScript );
// Check the response for the expected integration variable and its corresponding values
AppsScriptTaskTest . containsIntegrationVariable ( res , 'output' , true );
AppsScriptTaskTest . containsIntegrationVariable ( res , 'someOtherIntegrtionVariable' , false );
AppsScriptTaskTest . containsIntegrationVariableWithValue ( res , 'output' , 6 );
}
The following sample shows you how to access JSON and array variables in the testRun method:
function testRun (){
// Create a new request
let req = AppsScriptTaskTest . createNewTestRequest ( 'json-test' );
// Add a task parameter that references a JSON integration variable
AppsScriptTaskTest . setIntegrationVariableAndCreateReference ( req , "emp" , "employee" , { name : "snape" , age : 35 });
// Add a task parameter that references an array integration variable
AppsScriptTaskTest . setIntegrationVariableAndCreateReference ( req , "arr" , "array" , [ "A" , "B" , "C" ]);
// Run the task and get the response
// Assume that the run method increases the age of the employee by 5 and appends a new element in the array
let res = AppsScriptTaskTest . runTest ( req , executeScript );
// Check the response for the expected integration variable and its corresponding values
AppsScriptTaskTest . containsIntegrationVariableWithValue ( res , "employee" , { name : "snape" , age : 40 });
AppsScriptTaskTest . containsIntegrationVariable ( res , "array" , true );
AppsScriptTaskTest . containsIntegrationVariableWithValue ( res , "array" , [ "A" , "B" , "C" , "D" ]);
}
After running the test cases, you can view the assertions in the Execution log .
To view the logs, click Execution log from the menu.
Best practices
We do not recommend using the Apps Script task if you require latency less than 1 to 2 seconds for
the task in your integration.
In addition, we recommend coding all your logic in a single Apps Script task, rather than chaining
multiple Apps Script tasks, to minimize performance bottlenecks.
For information about the usage limits that apply to the Apps Script task, see Usage limits .
Considerations
When including the Apps Script task in your integration design, consider the following system limitations:
Maximum active deployments for an AppsScript: 50
Queries per second (QPS) for API executables: 5000/min
Queries per second (QPS) for Webapp deployments: 5000/min
Latency for API executables: 1.5s
Latency for Webapp: 2.5s
Maximum cumulative size of all the integration variables in an AppsScript: 15 MB
Error handling strategy
An error handling strategy for a task specifies the action to take if the task fails due to a temporary error . For information about how to use an error handling strategy, and to know about the different types of error handling strategies, see Error handling strategies .
SLA exclusions
The Apps Script task has a dependency on the Google Apps Script product.
Because this dependency is external to the Application Integration, all executions of
active integrations that fail because of the failure in
the Apps Script task, are excluded from
the Application Integration
Service Level Agreement (SLA) terms and conditions.
