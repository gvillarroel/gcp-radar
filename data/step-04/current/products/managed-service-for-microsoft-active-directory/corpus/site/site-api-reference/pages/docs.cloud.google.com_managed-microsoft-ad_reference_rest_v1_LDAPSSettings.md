State
LDAPSSettings represents the ldaps settings for domain resource. LDAP is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511 . The settings object configures LDAP over SSL/TLS, whether it is over port 636 or the StartTLS operation. If LDAPSSettings is being changed, it will be placed into the UPDATING state, which indicates that the resource is being reconciled. At this point, Get will reflect an intermediate state.

"certificate" : {
object ( Certificate )
} ,
"state" : enum ( State ) ,
"certificatePfx" : string ,
"certificatePassword" : string ,
"updateTime" : string
}
Fields
name
string
The resource name of the LDAPS settings. Uses the form: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/domains/{domain} .
certificate
object ( Certificate )
Output only. The certificate used to configure LDAPS. Certificates can be chained with a maximum length of 15.
state
enum ( State )
Output only. The current state of this LDAPS settings.
certificatePfx
string ( bytes format)
Input only. The uploaded PKCS12-formatted certificate to configure LDAPS with. It will enable the domain controllers in this domain to accept LDAPS connections (either LDAP over SSL/TLS or the StartTLS operation).
A valid certificate chain must form a valid x.509 certificate chain (or be comprised of a single self-signed certificate. It must be encrypted with either: 1) PBES2 + PBKDF2 + AES256 encryption and SHA256 PRF; or 2) pbeWithSHA1And3-KeyTripleDES-CBC Private key must be included for the leaf / single self-signed certificate.
Note: For a fqdn your-example-domain.com, the wildcard fqdn is *.your-example-domain.com. Specifically the leaf certificate must have: - Either a blank subject or a subject with CN matching the wildcard fqdn. - Exactly two SANs - the fqdn and wildcard fqdn. - Encipherment and digital key signature key usages. - Server authentication extended key usage (OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) - Private key must be in one of the following formats: RSA, ECDSA, ED25519. - Private key must have appropriate key length: 2048 for RSA, 256 for ECDSA - Signature algorithm of the leaf certificate cannot be MD2, MD5 or SHA1.
A base64-encoded string.
certificatePassword
string
Input only. The password used to encrypt the uploaded PFX certificate.
updateTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Output only. Last update time.
A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" .
Certificate
Certificate used to configure LDAPS.

"issuingCertificate" : {
object ( Certificate )
} ,

}
Fields
subject
string
The certificate subject.
thumbprint
string
The certificate thumbprint which uniquely identifies the certificate.
subjectAlternativeName[]
string
The additional hostnames for the domain.
issuingCertificate
object ( Certificate )
The issuer of this certificate.
expireTime
string ( Timestamp format)
The certificate expire time.
A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" .
