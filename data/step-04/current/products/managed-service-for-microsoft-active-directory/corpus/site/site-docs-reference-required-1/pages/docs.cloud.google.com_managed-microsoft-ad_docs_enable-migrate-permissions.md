This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This page explains how to enable the permissions required for migrating an
existing Active Directory domain from on-premises to Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory while
preserving SID history.
Before you begin
Before you begin, do the following:
Create a Managed Microsoft AD
domain .
Create a trust with the on-premises
domain .
Make sure that you read the Existing domain migration
overview and understand these
security
implications .
Make sure that you have any one of the following Identity and Access Management (
IAM) user roles:
Google Cloud Managed Identities Domain Admin
( roles/managedidentities.domainAdmin )
Google Cloud Managed Identities Admin ( roles/managedidentities.admin )
For more information, see Cloud Managed Identities
roles .
Enable permissions to migrate a domain with SID history
You can grant the permissions required to migrate a domain along with SID
history either to a global group or a single user. However, we recommend that
you use a global group to grant the permissions required to migrate a domain
along with SID history. Creating a global group makes it easier for you to
delegate the permissions to all of the users involved in migrating your domain.
For both these approaches, make sure that the users are part of
Managed Microsoft AD and have administrator privileges to the on-premises
domain.
Create a global group
To create a global group and add users, do the following:
Identify users who need to perform the migration activities that include
running ADMT.
Ensure that these users are part of Managed Microsoft AD and have
administrator privileges to the on-premises domain.
Create a global
group
in Managed Microsoft AD. For example, migrate_domain_admins .
For more information about global group, see Group
Scope .
Add the users to the global
group .
Enable permissions on the Managed Microsoft AD domain
When you enable the permissions required on Managed Microsoft AD using the
gcloud CLI, Managed Microsoft AD creates a delegated group,
Cloud Service Migrate SID Administrators , under the Cloud Service Objects
OU . This delegated
group provides the permissions required to migrate an on-premises domain along
with SID history.

Description
Cloud Service Migrate SID Administrators
Domain Local
Members can migrate SID history while migrating Active Directory objects from on-premises to Managed Microsoft AD using ADMT tool. This can include members from trusted domains.
To enable the permissions required for migrating your on-premises domain with
SID history, run the following gcloud CLI command:
gcloud beta active-directory domains migration enable DOMAIN_NAME \
--onprem-domains= SOURCE_DOMAIN_NAME \
--disable-sid-filtering-domains= SID_FILTERING_DOMAIN_NAME
Replace the following:
DOMAIN_NAME : The name of your Managed Microsoft AD domain.
For example, my-domain.com .
SOURCE_DOMAIN_NAME : The name of your on-premises domain which
Managed Microsoft AD trusts. For example, domain-one.com .
SID_FILTERING_DOMAIN_NAME : The name of your on-premises domain
for which you want to disable SID filtering. For example, domain-one.com .
Note: When you create a trust between on-premises and Managed Microsoft AD
domains, it has SID filtering enabled by default. If you want to disable SID
filtering until you migrate the domain, you can use the
--disable-sid-filtering-domains flag.
Delegate permissions
To delegate the ability to migrate an on-premises domain with SID history, add the
global group or the single user to the following groups on
Managed Microsoft AD:
Cloud Service Administrators
Cloud Service Migrate SID Administrators
Managed Microsoft AD delegates the permissions to users added to the global
group or the single user, which in turn lets them migrate SID history from the
on-premises domain using ADMT.
To add the global group or the user to the required Managed Microsoft AD
groups and delegate the permissions, run the following commands in PowerShell:
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity 'Cloud Service Administrators' \
-Members GROUP_OR_USER
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity 'Cloud Service Migrate SID Administrators' \
-Members GROUP_OR_USER
Replace GROUP_OR_USER with the name of your global group or user. For
example, migrate_domain_admins , my_user .
For more information, see
Add-ADGroupMember .
After you complete these steps, you can use ADMT and migrate your existing
domain from on-premises to Managed Microsoft AD with SID history.
