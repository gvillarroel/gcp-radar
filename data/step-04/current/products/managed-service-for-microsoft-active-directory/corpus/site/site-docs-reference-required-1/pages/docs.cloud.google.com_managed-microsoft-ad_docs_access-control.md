Access control with IAM
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles prescribe how you can use the
Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory (Managed Microsoft AD) API. Below is a list of each
IAM role available for Managed Microsoft AD and the methods
available to them.
Additionally, services accounts must have the servicemanagement.services.bind
permission to see and enable Managed Microsoft AD. Learn more about service
management roles and permissions .
