This page provides tips and approaches to troubleshoot and resolve
common issues with Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory.
Unable to create a Managed Microsoft AD domain
If you are unable to create a Managed Microsoft AD domain, verifying the
following configurations can help.
Required APIs
Managed Microsoft AD requires that you enable a group of APIs before you can
create a domain.
To verify that the required APIs are enabled, complete the following steps:
Console
Go to the APIs & Services page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to APIs & Services
On the Dashboard page, verify that the following APIs are listed:
Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory API
Compute Engine API
Cloud DNS API
gcloud
Run the following gcloud CLI command:
gcloud services list --available
The command returns the list of enabled APIs. Verify that the following APIs
are listed:
Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory API
Compute Engine API
Cloud DNS API
If any of these APIs are missing, complete the following steps to enable them:
Console
Go to the
API Library page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to API Library
On the API Library page, in the search field, enter the name of the missing
API.
On the API information page, click Enable .
gcloud
Run the following gcloud CLI command:
gcloud services enable API_NAME
Replace API_NAME with the name of the missing API.
Repeat this process until all of the required APIs are enabled.
Billing
Managed Microsoft AD requires that you enable billing before you can create a
domain.
To verify that billing is enabled, complete the following steps:
Console
Go to the Billing page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to Billing
Verify that there is a billing account set up for your organization.
Click the My projects tab and then verify that the
project where you are trying to create a Managed Microsoft AD domain is
listed.
gcloud
Run the following gcloud CLI command:
gcloud billing projects describe PROJECT_ID
If you do not see a valid billing account linked to the project, you should
enable billing .
IP address range
If you receive an IP range overlap error when you try to create a
domain, it means that the reserved IP address range that you
provided in the domain creation request overlaps with the IP address range of
the authorized network. To resolve this issue, you should choose a different IP
address range or a different authorized network. For more information, see
Select IP address ranges .
Permissions
If you receive a Permission denied error when you try to create a
domain, you should verify that the calling identity is
allowed to call the Managed Microsoft AD API. Learn more about
Managed Microsoft AD roles and permissions .
Organization policy
The domain creation can fail because of an organization policy configuration.
For example, you can configure an organization policy to allow access to only
specific services, such as GKE or Compute Engine. Learn more
about Organization policy
constraints .
Ask your administrator who has the organization policy administrator
( roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin )
IAM role on the organization to update the required organization
policies.
Resource Location Restriction organization policy
This list constraint defines the set of locations where location-based
Google Cloud resources can be created. Denying the global location can impact
Managed Microsoft AD.
To view and update the Resource Location Restriction organization policy:
Console
Go to the Organization policies page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Organization policies
On the Organization policies page, in the Name column, select the
Resource Location Restriction policy to open the Policy summary
panel.
In the Policy summary panel, verify that the global location is
allowed.
If you need to make a change, select Edit , update the policy, and
then click Save .
Learn about
restricting resource locations .
gcloud
To view the details for the Resource Location Restriction organization
policy, run the following gcloud CLI command. Learn about the
gcloud resource-manager org-policies describe
command.
gcloud resource-manager org-policies describe constraints/gcp.resourceLocations \
--organization= ORGANIZATION_ID
If the describe command shows that global is not allowed, run the
following command to allow it. Learn about the
gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow
command.
gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow constraints/gcp.resourceLocations global \
--organization= ORGANIZATION_ID
Learn about
restricting resource locations .
Restrict VPC peering usage organization policy
This list constraint defines the set of VPC networks that are allowed to be
peered with the VPC networks belonging to a given resource. When you specify an
authorized network for a Managed Microsoft AD domain, a VPC peering is created
between the authorized network and the isolated network containing the AD domain
controllers. If the organization policy for the project denies peerings,
Managed Microsoft AD cannot
create any peerings to the authorized network so domain creation fails. You
receive an error like this:
GCE_PRECONDITION_FAILED: Constraint constraints /compute.restrictVpcPeering
violated for project PROJECT_ID . Peering the network projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ VPC_NETWORK_NAME
is not allowed.
To view and update the Restrict VPC peering usage organization policy:
Console
Go to the Organization policies page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Organization policies
On the Organization policies page, in the Name column, select the
Restrict VPC peering usage policy to open the Policy summary
panel.
In the Policy summary panel, verify that the project allows peerings.
If you need to make a change, select Edit , update the policy, and
then click Save .
gcloud
To view the details for the Restrict VPC peering usage organization
policy, run the following gcloud CLI command. Learn about the
gcloud resource-manager org-policies describe command.
gcloud resource-manager org-policies describe constraints/compute.restrictVpcPeering \
--organization= ORGANIZATION_ID
If the describe command shows that peerings are not allowed, run the
following command to allow it. Learn about the
gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow
command.
gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow constraints/compute.restrictVpcPeering under:projects/ PROJECT_ID \
--organization= ORGANIZATION_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the name of the project that contains the Managed Microsoft AD resource.
ORGANIZATION_ID : the ID of the organization that hosts that project.
Unable to join a Windows VM automatically to a domain
Here are some issues with error codes that you might run into when trying to
join a Windows VM or
GKE Windows Server
nodes automatically to a
domain:
Error code
Description
Potential solution
CONFLICT (409)
Indicates that the VM instance account already exists in the Managed Microsoft AD domain.
Remove the account manually from Managed Microsoft AD using RSAT tools and try again. For more information about managing AD objects in Managed Microsoft AD, see Manage Active Directory objects .
BAD_REQUEST (412)
Indicates that the domain join request contains invalid information such as incorrect domain name and incorrect organizational unit (OU) hierarchy structure.
Review the information, update the details if required, and try again.
INTERNAL (500)
Indicates that the server encountered an unknown internal error.
Contact Google Cloud Support to resolve this issue.
FORBIDDEN (403)
Indicates that the specified service account doesn't have the required privileges.
Check if you have the required privileges on the service account and try again.
UNAUTHORIZED (401)
Indicates that the VM lacks valid authorization to join the domain.
Check if you have the required access scope on the VM and try again.
Unable to join a VM manually to a domain
If you're unable to join a machine manually from an on-premises environment to
your Managed Microsoft AD domain, verify the following requirements:
The machine that you're trying to join is discoverable from
Managed Microsoft AD. To verify this connectivity, perform a DNS lookup
from the on-premises environment to the Managed Microsoft AD domain
using the nslookup
command .
The on-premises network that the machine is in must be peered with
VPC network of your Managed Microsoft AD domain. For
information about troubleshooting a VPC Network Peering connection, see
Troubleshooting .
Unable to use Shared VPC as authorized network
In order to access a Managed Microsoft AD domain from a Shared VPC network,
the domain must be created in the same project that hosts the Shared VPC
network.
Unable to access Managed Microsoft AD domain
If your Managed Microsoft AD domain seems to be unavailable, you can get more
information about its status by completing the following steps:
Console
Go to the
Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory
page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory
On the Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory page, in the
Status column, you can view the statuses for your domains.
gcloud
Run the following gcloud CLI command:
gcloud active-directory domains list
This command returns the statuses for your domains.
If your domain status is DOWN , this indicates that your account may
have been suspended. Contact Google Cloud Support to
resolve this issue.
If your domain status is PERFORMING_MAINTENANCE ,
Managed Microsoft AD should still be available for use, but may not allow
operations such as extending schema, adding or removing regions. This status is
rare and only happens when the OS is patched.
Unable to create trust
If you follow the steps for
creating a trust , but cannot complete
the process, verifying the following configurations can help.
On-premises domain is reachable
To verify that the on-premises domain is reachable from the
Managed Microsoft AD domain, you can use ping or
Test-NetConnection . Run these commands from a
VM hosted on Google Cloud and on an authorized network. Verify that
the VM can reach an on-premises domain controller. Learn more about
Test-NetConnection .
IP address
To verify that the IP address that was supplied during the trust setup is able
to resolve the on-premises domain, run the following command:
nslookup ON_PREMISES_DOMAIN_NAME CONDITIONAL_FORWARDER_ADDRESS
Replace the following:
ON_PREMISES_DOMAIN_NAME : the name of your on-premises domain.
CONDITIONAL_FORWARDER_ADDRESS : the IP address of your DNS conditional forwarder.
If there are multiple conditional forwarder addresses, you can test against any
of them.
Learn more about
nslookup .
On-premises trust relationship
To verify that the on-premises trust relationship is established, you should
check that the following information matches.
The trust type and direction on the Managed Microsoft AD domain
complements the trust created on the on-premises domain.
The trust secret provided while creating the trust on the
Managed Microsoft AD domain matches the one entered on the on-premises
domain.
The on-premises trust direction complements the trust direction configured on
Managed Microsoft AD. That is, if the on-premises domain expects an inbound
trust, the trust direction for the Managed Microsoft AD domain is outbound.
Learn more about trust
directions .
Trust no longer works
If you previously created a trust, but it no longer works, you should verify
the same configurations as you would for
troubleshooting creating a trust .
Additionally, if a trust is not used for 60 days or more, the trust password
expires. To refresh the password, change the password for the trust on the
on-premises domain, and then update the password on the Managed Microsoft AD
domain.
Active Directory authentication is failing (Managed Microsoft AD-hosted accounts)
If it appears that the Active Directory authentication is failing when using
Managed Microsoft AD-hosted accounts, verifying the following configurations
can help.
VM is on an authorized network
To verify that the VM used to access the domain is on an authorized network,
complete the following steps.
Go to the
Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory
page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory
Select the name of your domain.
On the Domain page, under Networks , check that the authorized network
is listed.
Username and password are correct
Verify that the username and password provided to log in are correct.
Firewall rules
A deny firewall rule for egress to the domain
controllers' IP address range can cause authentication to fail.
To check your firewall rules, complete the following steps:
Console
Go to the Firewall rules
page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Firewall rules
On this page, check that there is not a deny for egress
configured for the domain controllers' IP address range.
gcloud
Run the following gcloud CLI command:
gcloud compute firewall-rules list
This command returns a list of the configured firewall rules. Check that
there is not a deny for egress configured for the domain
controllers' IP address range.
Learn more about firewall rules .
IP address
Authentication can fail if the IP address is not in the reserved CIDR range.
To check the IP address, run the following command.
nslookup DOMAIN_NAME
If nslookup fails or returns an IP address that is not in CIDR range, you
should verify that the DNS zone exists.
To validate that the DNS zone exists, complete the following steps:
Console
Go to the Cloud DNS page in
the Google Cloud console.
Go to Cloud DNS
On the Cloud DNS page, on the Zones tab, check the In use by
column for the authorized network.
gcloud
Run the following gcloud CLI command:
gcloud dns managed-zones list --filter= FQDN
Replace FQDN with the fully qualified domain name of your Managed Microsoft AD domain.
If none of the listed zones are in use by the authorized network, you should
remove and re-add the authorized network.
Network peering
Authentication can fail if VPC network peering is not properly configured.
To verify peering is set up, complete the following steps:
Console
Go to the
VPC network peering page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to VPC network peering
On the VPC network peering page, in the Name column, look for a
peering called peering- VPC_NETWORK_NAME .
gcloud
Run the following gcloud CLI command:
gcloud compute networks peerings list --network= VPC_NETWORK_NAME
This command returns a list of peerings. In the list, look for one
called peering- VPC_NETWORK_NAME .
If peering- VPC_NETWORK_NAME is not in the
list, you should remove and re-add the authorized network.
Active Directory authentication is failing (via trust)
If it appears that the Active Directory authentication is failing when using
managed on-premises hosted accounts via trust, you should verify
the same configurations as you would for
troubleshooting creating a trust .
Additionally, verify that the account is in the
Cloud Service Computer Remote Desktop Users delegated group. Learn more about
delegated groups
Unable to access the domain from a manageability VM
If you are unable to access the Managed Microsoft AD domain from the VM
used for managing AD
objects , you should
verify the same configurations as you would for troubleshooting Active
Directory authentication for Managed Microsoft AD-hosted
accounts .
Org policy error when creating, updating, or deleting
If you encounter an org policy error when creating, updating, or deleting
resources, you may need to change an organization policy. Learn about
Organization Policy Constraints .
Ask your administrator who has the organization policy administrator
( roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin )
IAM role on the organization to update the required organization
policies.
Define allowed APIs and services organization policy
This list constraint defines the set of services and APIs that can be
enabled on a given resource. Its descendants in the resource hierarchy also
inherit the constraint. If this constraint does not allow the APIs that are
required for Managed Microsoft AD, you receive an error when you try to
create, update, or delete resources.
To view and update the Define allowed APIs and services organization policy:
Console
Go to the Organization policies page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Organization policies
On the Organization policies page, in the Name column, select the
Define allowed APIs and services policy to open the Policy
summary panel.
In the Policy summary panel, verify that the following APIs are not
denied:
dns.googleapis.com
compute.googleapis.com
If you need to make a change, select Edit , update the policy, and
then click Save .
gcloud
Run the following gcloud CLI command. Learn about the
gcloud resource-manager org-policies describe
command.
gcloud resource-manager org-policies describe constraints/serviceuser.services \
--organization= ORGANIZATION_ID
If the describe command shows that dns.googleapis.com or
compute.googleapis.com is not allowed, run the following command to
allow it. Learn about the
gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow command.
gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow constraints/serviceuser.services API_NAME \
--organization= ORGANIZATION_ID
Restrict VPC peering usage organization policy
This list constraint defines the set of VPC networks that are allowed to be
peered with the VPC networks belonging to a given resource. If peerings are
denied, you receive an error when you try to create, update, or delete
resources. Learn
how to view and update the Restrict VPC peering usage organization policy .
Unable to resolve on-premises resources from Google Cloud
If you are unable to resolve on-premises resources from Google Cloud,
you may need to change your DNS configuration. Learn
how to configure
DNS forwarding to resolve queries for non-Managed Microsoft AD objects in VPC networks .
Intermittent DNS lookup failures
If you are experiencing intermittent DNS lookup failures when using a highly
available scheme for Cloud Interconnect or multiple VPNs, you should verify
the following configurations:
A route for 35.199.192.0/19 exists.
The on-premises network allows traffic from 35.199.192.0/19 for all
Cloud Interconnect connections or VPN tunnels.
Delegated administrator account password expires
If the password for the delegated administrator account has expired, you can
reset the
password .
Make sure that you have the required permissions to reset the password for the
delegated administrator account. If you want, you can also disable the password
expiration
for the account.
Unable to view Managed Microsoft AD audit logs
If you are unable to view any Managed Microsoft AD audit logs in the
Logs Viewer or Logs Explorer, you should verify the following configurations.
Logging is enabled for the domain .
You have the roles/logging.viewer IAM role on the project
where the domain is located.
