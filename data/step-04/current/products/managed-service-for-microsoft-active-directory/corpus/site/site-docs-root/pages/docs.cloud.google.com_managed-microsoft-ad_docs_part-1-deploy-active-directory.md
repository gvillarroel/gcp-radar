Deploy an Active Directory resource forest
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This series walks you through using Managed Microsoft AD to deploy an
Active Directory
resource forest
on Google Cloud. You'll learn how to:
Set up a Shared VPC that enables you to access Managed Microsoft AD from
multiple projects, and connect Managed Microsoft AD to an on-premises
Active Directory using a forest trust.
Configure firewall rules that protect access to Active Directory from
unauthorized sources.
Deploy Managed Microsoft AD in a single region and connect it to an existing
Shared VPC.
Create a management VM and join it to the domain.
Use a delegated administrator to connect to Managed Microsoft AD.
Architecture overview
To allow VMs from multiple projects to use Active Directory, you'll need a
Shared VPC and three separate subnets:
Managed Microsoft AD subnet : Used by Managed Microsoft AD to run
domain controllers.
Management subnet : Contains machines that are exclusively used
for the purpose of managing Active Directory.
Resource subnets: Contains Active Directory member servers (such as
application or database servers). Each resource subnet is scoped to a single
region. In this guide, you will only create a single resource subnet, but you
can add additional resource subnets later if you plan to deploy servers across
multiple regions.
To reduce security risks, you'll deploy a management VM with an internal
RFC 1918 IP address and no internet access. To log in to VM instances, you'll use
IAP TCP tunneling .
Following the best practice of using separate projects for management and
servers, you'll create two separate projects:
VPC host project : Contains the Shared VPC configuration
as well as Managed Microsoft AD.
Management project : Dedicated to managing Active Directory. You'll create
a management VM within this project and use it to configure Active Directory.
Before you begin
This tutorial uses a Shared VPC, which requires the use of a Google Cloud
Organization. If you do not have an organization,
create one first .
Additionally, some setup activities require
administrative roles . Ensure you are
granted the following IAM roles before proceeding.
Organization Admin
Shared VPC Admin
Network User
This article assumes you are using a Windows machine with the
Google Cloud CLI installed . You'll need to adjust some of the steps
if you are using a different operating system.
Finally, collect the following information before you begin:
Project names for the VPC host project and the management project .
These two projects will serve a central role in your deployment, so pick names
that are easy to recognize and follow
your corporate naming conventions .
Folders to create the
VPC host project and the management project project in. If you don't
have a suitable folder already, consider creating a
separate sub-folder for cross-functional resources
and services such as Active Directory.
A DNS domain name to use for the forest root domain of the new Active
Directory forest.
An initial region to deploy resources in. Note that
you can only deploy Managed Microsoft AD in
some regions
(this doesn't affect the general availability of your
domain, which is available in all regions where your VPC has a presence).
Consult the
best practices on region selection
if you are unsure which region best suits your needs. You will be able to
extend the deployment to additional regions later.
The name of the shared VPC to create. As the VPC will be shared across
multiple projects, make sure to pick a name that is easy to recognize.
Subnet ranges for the following subnets:
Managed Microsoft AD subnet : Must be at least /24 in size.
Management subnet : Needs to accommodate all management servers.
A subnet range sized /28 or larger is recommended.
Resource subnet : Size this subnet so it can accommodate all the servers
you plan to deploy in the initial region.
Make sure your subnets do not overlap with any on-premises subnets and
allow sufficient room for growth.
Costs
The tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud, including
Compute Engine , Cloud DNS , and
Google Cloud Observability . See the
Pricing calculator
to calculate the costs of completing this tutorial. Be sure to include any other
resources specific to your deployment.
Setting up VPC networking
Creating the VPC host project
A VPC host project is used to create a Shared VPC and manage network-related
configuration, such as subnets, firewall rules, and routes.
In the Google Cloud console, open the Manage resources page.
Open the Manage resources page
In the Organization drop-down list at upper left, select your
organization.
Click Create Project and enter the following settings:
Project Name : The ID you chose as the project name.
Billing account : Your billing account.
Location : The folder to create the project in.
Click Create .
Warning: Changes in the VPC host project can have far-reaching consequences on
the functionality and security of projects and applications using the Shared
VPC. Therefore, only a small group of administrative staff should be allowed to
access this project. Before granting users access to this project, review the
best practices to verify access attempts .
Protecting the project against accidental deletion
Deleting a project also deletes any Managed Microsoft AD domains deployed
inside it. In addition to using IAM policies to limit access to
the project, you should protect the
project against accidental deletion .
In the Google Cloud console ,
open Cloud Shell . Cloud Shell gives you
access to the command line in Google Cloud console, and includes
Google Cloud CLI and other tools you need for Google Cloud administration.
Cloud Shell can take several minutes to provision.
Activate Cloud Shell
Initialize variables to contain your organization name and the project ID
of the VPC host project:
ORG_NAME=[ORG-NAME] \
VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID=[PROJECT-ID]
Replace [ORG-NAME] by the name of your organization and
[PROJECT-ID] with the ID of the VPC host project. For example:
ORG_NAME=example.com
VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID=ad-host-123
Run the following command to look up the ID of your organization, replacing
ORG-NAME with the name of your organization (such as example.com ):
ORG_ID=$(gcloud organizations list \
--filter="DISPLAY_NAME=$ORG_NAME" \
--format=value\(ID\)) && \
echo "ID of $ORG_NAME is $ORG_ID"
Enforce compute.restrictXpnProjectLienRemoval policy for your
organization:
gcloud resource-manager org-policies enable-enforce \
--organization $ORG_ID compute.restrictXpnProjectLienRemoval
Deleting the default VPC
Compute Engine creates a default VPC in each project you create. This
VPC is configured in auto mode , which means a
subnet is pre-allocated for each region and automatically assigned a subnet
range.
If you are planning to connect the VPC to an on-premises network, the predefined
IP ranges that Compute Engine uses in auto mode are unlikely to suit
your needs; they might overlap with existing IP ranges, or be inadequately
sized. You should delete the default VPC and replace it with a custom mode VPC.
Return to your existing Cloud Shell session.
Enable the Compute Engine API in the VPC host project:
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com --project=$VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID
Delete all firewall rules associated with the default VPC:
gcloud compute firewall-rules list \
--filter="network=default" \
--project=$VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID \
--format=value\(name\) | \
xargs gcloud compute firewall-rules delete \
--project=$VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID
Delete the default VPC:
gcloud compute networks delete default --project=$VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID
Creating the Shared VPC and subnets
With the default VPC deleted, you can now create the custom VPC (you'll
turn this into into a shared VPC later).
Return to your existing Cloud Shell session.
Create variables for the VPC name, initial region, and subnet
ranges:
SHAREDVPC_NAME =[ NAME ] \
SUBNET_REGION =[ REGION ] \
SUBNET_RANGE_MANAGEMENT =[ MANAGEMENT-RANGE ] \
SUBNET_RANGE_RESOURCES =[ RESOURCES-RANGE ] \
SUBNET_RANGE_MANAGEDAD =[ MANAGED-AD-RANGE ] \
SUBNET_RANGE_ONPREMAD =[ ONPREM-AD-RANGE ]
Replace the placeholder variables with the following:
[NAME] with a name, such as ad-network-env-test.
[REGION] with the region to deploy the Active Directory domain
controllers in. You can extend the VPC and your domain to cover
additional regions at any time.
[MANAGEMENT-RANGE] with the subnet range to use for the
management subnet .
[RESOURCES-RANGE] with the subnet range to use for the
resource subnet .
[MANAGED-AD-RANGE] with the subnet range to use for the
Managed Microsoft AD subnet .
[ONPREM-AD-RANGE] with the subnet range to use for the
on-prem AD subnet .
For example:
SHAREDVPC_NAME=ad-network \
SUBNET_REGION=us-central1 \
SUBNET_RANGE_MANAGEMENT=10.0.0.0/24 \
SUBNET_RANGE_RESOURCES=10.0.1.0/24 \
SUBNET_RANGE_MANAGEDAD=10.0.2.0/24 \
SUBNET_RANGE_ONPREMAD=192.168.0.0/24
Enable the VPC host project to host a Shared VPC:
gcloud compute shared-vpc enable $VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID
Create a new custom mode VPC network :
gcloud compute networks create $SHAREDVPC_NAME \
--subnet-mode=custom \
--project=$VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID
Create the management and resource subnet, and enable
Private Google Access so that
Windows can be activated
without granting the VMs direct internet access.
gcloud compute networks subnets create $SUBNET_REGION - management \
-- network = $SHAREDVPC_NAME \
-- range = $SUBNET_RANGE_MANAGEMENT \
-- region = $SUBNET_REGION \
-- enable - private - ip - google - access \
-- project = $VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID && \
gcloud compute networks subnets create $SUBNET_REGION - resources \
-- network = $SHAREDVPC_NAME \
-- range = $SUBNET_RANGE_RESOURCES \
-- region = $SUBNET_REGION \
-- enable - private - ip - google - access \
-- project = $VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID
Securing the Shared VPC
Your VPC host project now contains a Shared VPC with two subnets.
By attaching service projects
to this Shared VPC, you can make the Shared VPC available for use across
multiple projects.
Rather than granting members of service projects
permission to use all subnets
of the Shared VPC, you should
grant access by subnet .
For security reasons, grant only a small group of administrative staff the right
to access the management subnet . This ensures the subnet is only used to
manage Active Directory. You can apply more lenient access control to the
resource subnet .
Creating firewall rules
Before you deploy Active Directory, you'll need to create firewall rules that
allow you to administer and use it.
Return to your existing Cloud Shell session.
Enable firewall logging for ingress traffic so that all failed access
attempts are logged:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create deny-ingress-from-all \
--direction=INGRESS \
--action=deny \
--rules=tcp:0-65535,udp:0-65535 \
--enable-logging \
--source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 \
--network=$SHAREDVPC_NAME \
--project=$VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID \
--priority 65000
You will administer Active Directory using a dedicated management server
deployed in the management subnet. Because this server will be deployed
without an external IP address, you'll need to use
IAP TCP forwarding to
connect to the server.
Create the following firewall rule to allow RDP ingress from
IAP:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-rdp-ingress-from-iap \
--direction=INGRESS \
--action=allow \
--rules=tcp:3389 \
--enable-logging \
--source-ranges=35.235.240.0/20 \
--network=$SHAREDVPC_NAME \
--project=$VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID \
--priority 10000
Your Shared VPC is now ready to be used for deploying Managed Microsoft AD.
Deploying Active Directory
Managed Microsoft AD handles the provisioning and maintenance of Active
Directory domain controllers. The following roles are deployed on the domain
controllers:
Active Directory Domain Services
DNS
The domain controllers are deployed outside of your project, and will not appear
as VM instances in your project. To make the domain controllers available for
you to use, the following changes are applied to your project when you deploy
Managed Microsoft AD:
VPC peering is added to your VPC. This connects
your VPC to the service VPC that contains the domain controllers.
A Cloud DNS private DNS peered zone is
created in the project. It forwards DNS queries matching your Active
Directory domain to the DNS service run as part of Managed Microsoft AD.
Because you are using a Shared VPC, you need to deploy Managed Microsoft AD in
the VPC host project in order for Active Directory to be usable across all
service projects.
Creating the Active Directory forest and domain
Follow these steps to deploy Managed Microsoft AD in the VPC host project
created in the previous part of the guide:
In the Google Cloud console, return to Cloud Shell.
Initialize a variable to contain the forest root domain name of the new
Active Directory forest to create. Refer to the
Microsoft naming conventions
for guidance on choosing a name.
AD_DNS_DOMAIN=[AD-DNS-NAME]
For example:
AD_DNS_DOMAIN=cloud.example.com
Enable Cloud DNS in the VPC host project:
gcloud services enable dns.googleapis.com --project $VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID
Enable Managed Microsoft AD API in the VPC host project:
gcloud services enable managedidentities.googleapis.com --project $VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID
Provision the domain controllers and create a new forest:
gcloud active - directory domains create $AD_DNS_DOMAIN \
-- admin - name = SetupAdmin \
-- reserved - ip - range = $SUBNET_RANGE_MANAGEDAD \
-- region = $SUBNET_REGION \
-- authorized - networks = projects / $VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID / global / networks / $SHAREDVPC_NAME \
-- project = $VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID
Allow 15 to 20 minutes for the command to complete.
The previous command creates an initial Active Directory user named
SetupAdmin@[AD_DNS_DOMAIN] for you. This user has delegated administrator
privileges, and you can use it to finish configuring the new Active
Directory forest.
To reveal the credentials of the user, run the following command.
You will need to confirm that it is safe for the password to be revealed on
screen.
gcloud active-directory domains reset-admin-password $AD_DNS_DOMAIN \
--project=$VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID
Copy the password; you will need it later.
The password can be reset by project owners and project editors of the VPC
Host project at any time.
Creating the management project
The Active Directory forest and forest root domain created by
Managed Microsoft AD is now fully operational, and you have a first user
( SetupAdmin ) to perform further configuration. However, because
Managed Microsoft AD domain controllers cannot be accessed directly using
RDP, any configuration must be handled using a management VM.
You'll create this VM instance in a project dedicated to Active Directory
management, and then connect the VM instance to the management subnet of the
Shared VPC.
Once joined to the domain, you can use the
Remote Server Administration Tools ,
the Group Policy Management Console ,
and PowerShell to administer Active Directory and Active Directory-related
resources.
To create the management project:
In the Google Cloud console, open the Manage resources page.
Open the Manage resources page
In the Organization drop-down list at upper left, select your
organization.
Click Create Project and complete the following fields:
Project Name : The ID you chose as the project name.
Billing account : Your billing account. If you have access to several
billing accounts, review your internal policies for each of them and
choose the appropriate one.
Location : A folder to create the project in.
Click Create .
The management project will contain VM instances for administering
Active Directory. In the tiered administration model, this means that highly
privileged users from Tier 0 will be signing in to these VM instances.
These instances can be attractive targets for attackers; they potentially offer the
opportunity to capture passwords, password hashes, or Kerberos tokens.
And since these credentials have administrative access to Active Directory, they
could be used to compromise the domain.
VM instances in the management project should be treated equivalently to
privileged access workstations .
This implies:
Only a small group of administrative staff should be granted privileges
to log in to these instances (whether by RDP or other means).
Access to the containing management project should be granted on a
least privilege basis. Only
a selected few users should be allowed to view and access resources in the
Google Cloud project.
To learn more about securing a Google Cloud project, review the
best practices to verify access attempts .
Using the Shared VPC instead of the default VPC
The management project currently has its own default VPC. Since you'll be
using a Shared VPC instead, you can delete this VPC.
In the Google Cloud console, return to Cloud Shell.
Initialize a variable to contain the project ID of the management project
(replace [MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID] with the project ID of the management
project you just created):
MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID =[ MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID ]
Enable the Compute Engine API in the VPC host project:
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com \
--project=$MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID
Delete all firewall rules associated with the default VPC:
gcloud compute firewall-rules list \
--filter="network=default" \
--project=$MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID \
--format=value\(name\) | \
xargs gcloud compute firewall-rules delete \
--project=$MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID
Delete the default VPC:
gcloud compute networks delete default --project=$MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID
Associate the management project with the Shared VPC:
gcloud compute shared-vpc associated-projects add $MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID \
--host-project=$VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID
The management project is now a
service project ,
and you can use the Shared VPC from within the management project.
Connecting to Active Directory
You are now ready to create a first management VM instance and join it to
Active Directory. You can use this VM to configure your Active Directory forest
and forest root domain.
Creating a management VM
To create a management VM instance, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, return to Cloud Shell.
Create a new VM instance running Windows Server 2019 with
Remote Server Admin Tools (RSAT) ,
DNS server administration tools, and Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
preinstalled.
Since you'll access the machine using
IAP TCP forwarding ,
the instance does not need to be assigned an
external IP address .
gcloud compute instances create admin - 01 \
-- image - family = windows - 2019 \
-- image - project = windows - cloud \
-- machine - type = n1 - standard - 2 \
-- no - address \
-- zone = $ SUBNET_REGION - a \
-- subnet = projects / $ VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID / regions / $ SUBNET_REGION / subnetworks / $ SUBNET_REGION - management \
-- project = $ MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID \
-- metadata = "sysprep-specialize-script-ps1=Install-WindowsFeature -Name RSAT-AD-Tools;Install-WindowsFeature -Name GPMC;Install-WindowsFeature -Name RSAT-DNS-Server"
Run the following command to observe the boot process.
gcloud compute instances tail-serial-port-output admin-01 \
--zone=$SUBNET_REGION-a \
--project=$MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID
Wait about 4 minutes until you see the output Instance setup finished ,
then press Ctrl+C. The VM instances is now ready for use.
Create a local SAM user LocalAdmin on the instance:
gcloud compute reset-windows-password admin-01 \
--user=LocalAdmin \
--project=$MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID \
--zone=$SUBNET_REGION-a \
--quiet
Copy the password; you'll need it later.
Joining the management VM to the domain
You can now log in to the management VM and join it to Active Directory
On your local Windows workstation, open a command prompt ( cmd ).
If this is the first time using gcloud on your local workstation, make
sure to authenticate first.
Run the following command to establish an IAP TCP tunnel from
your local workstation to the admin-01 VM, replacing
[MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID] with the ID of the management project.
gcloud compute start - iap - tunnel admin - 01 3389 ^
--local-host-port=localhost:13389 ^
--project=[MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID]
Wait for the following output to appear
Listening on port [13389]`
The tunnel is now ready for use.
Open the Windows Remote Desktop Connection client ( mstsc.exe ).
Click Show Options .
Enter the following values:
Computer : localhost:13389
User name : localhost\LocalAdmin
Click Connect .
In the Enter your credentials dialog, paste the password you
generated previously for the local LocalAdmin user. Then click OK .
Since you have not set up RDP certificates for the management VM, a warning
message will appear indicating that the identity of the remote computer
cannot be verified. Dismiss this warning by clicking Yes .
You should now see the Windows Server desktop of the admin-01 VM.
Right-click the Start button (or press Win+X ) and click
Command Prompt (Admin) .
Confirm the elevation prompt by clicking Yes .
In the elevated command prompt, start a PowerShell session by running
powershell .
Run the following command to initiate a domain join.
Add-Computer -DomainName [AD-DNS-NAME]
Replace [AD-DNS-NAME] by the DNS name of the DNS name for the forest root
domain.
In the Windows PowerShell credential request dialog, enter the following
values:
User name : SetupAdmin
Password : Enter the password created for SetupAdmin when deploying
Managed Microsoft AD. Do not use the password of the local
LocalAdmin user.
Restart the computer by running Restart-Computer . Allow about one minute
for the VM to restart.
Launching Active Directory Users and Computers
The management VM is now a member of your Active Directory domain. You can use
it to administer Active Directory:
On your local Windows workstation, open the
Windows Remote Desktop Connection client ( mstsc.exe ).
Click Show Options .
Enter the following values:
Computer : localhost:13389
User name : SetupAdmin@[AD-DNS-NAME] . Replace [AD-DNS-NAME] with
the DNS name of the DNS name for the forest root domain.
Click Connect .
In the Enter your credentials dialog, paste the password you generated
previously for the SetupAdmin user. Then click OK .
Since you have not set up RDP certificates for the management VM, a warning
message will appear indicating that the identity of the remote computer
cannot be verified. Dismiss this warning by clicking Yes .
You should now see the Windows Server desktop of the admin-01 VM.
Right-click the Start button (or press Win+X ) and select Run .
Enter dsa.msc and click OK .
You should now see the Active Directory Users and Computers :
Congratulations! You are connected to your Managed Microsoft AD domain!
Cleaning up
If you don't plan to use the resources from this tutorial in the future, clean
them up so you won't be billed for them.
Warning: When you delete a project, all resources inside it are deleted.
If you used an existing project for this tutorial, you'll also delete any other
work you've done inside it. Additionally, any
custom project IDs will be lost. If you created a custom project ID that
you want to use in the future (such as an appspot.com
URL), only delete selected resources instead of the entire project.
Deleting the Active Directory forest and domain
In the Google Cloud console, open Cloud Shell.
Run the following command to delete the Active Directory forest and domain,
replacing [AD_DNS_DOMAIN] with the DNS domain name used for
Managed Microsoft AD domain, and [VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID] with the ID of
your VPC host project:
gcloud active - directory domains delete [ AD_DNS_DOMAIN ] \
--project=[VPCHOST_PROJECT_ID]
Deleting the management project
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Projects page.
Open the Projects page
In the project list, select the management project and click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, then click Shut down to delete the
project.
Deleting the VPC host project
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Projects page.
Open the Projects page
In the project list, select the VPC host project and click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, then click Shut down to delete the
project.
What's next
