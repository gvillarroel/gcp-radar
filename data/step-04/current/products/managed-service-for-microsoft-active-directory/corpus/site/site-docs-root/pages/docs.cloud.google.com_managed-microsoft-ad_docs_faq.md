This page provides answers to some common questions about Google Cloud's
Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory.
Which user account can I use to administer the Managed Microsoft AD?
When you create a new domain, Managed Microsoft AD automatically creates a
delegated administrator
account . You can use
this user account to manage the Active Directory objects in your domain. The
delegated administrator account doesn't have the Domain Administrator and
Enterprise Administrator permissions, because Managed Microsoft AD is a
managed service and Google reserves the right to use these permissions.
What are the capabilities of a delegated administrator account?
The delegated administrator account has the permissions to perform a specific
list of administrative activities to manage the Active Directory objects. The
delegated administrator account doesn't have the permissions to perform any
other administrative activities. For example, a delegated administrator can't
create and manage the domain-level policies, and it can't perform administrative
tasks such as backing up and restoring domains and extending the schema using
the standard AD tools. For more information, see Delegated
administrator .
However, you can use these features through Managed Microsoft AD. Any user
who has the necessary permissions to back up and restore a
domain and extend
the schema can
initiate these tasks.
How can I manage organizational units (OU)?
When you create a new domain, Managed Microsoft AD automatically creates
the Cloud and Cloud Service Objects OUs along with other default Active
Directory objects . For more information
about managing these objects, see Manage Active Directory
objects .
How can I manage group policy objects (GPO)?
By default, Managed Microsoft AD creates the Cloud Service Default
Computer Policy GPO
along with other default Active Directory
objects and links it to the Cloud OU. If
you need additional GPOs, you can create custom GPOs and add them to either the
Cloud OU or to any other custom OUs that you have created under the Cloud
OU. Only the creator of a custom GPO can edit it. For more information about managing these objects, see Manage Active
Directory objects .
How are domain controllers deployed?
Managed Microsoft AD creates domain controllers as VMs in dedicated
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks. Managed Microsoft AD then
connects the domain controller VPC networks to your other
existing VPC networks using VPC Network Peering .
For more information, see Deploy an Active Directory resource forest .
What are the supported Windows and Linux versions that I can join to a domain?
For information about the supported Windows and Linux versions that you can join
to a domain, see Compatible OS
versions .
When I create a new Managed Microsoft AD domain, how can I select the suitable IP address range?
Managed Microsoft AD requires a minimum of a /24 private RFC
1918 CIDR range, such
as 10.1.0.0/24 , that isn't already a subnet on your authorized
VPC network.
For more information, see Select IP address
ranges .
Where can I view the event logs for domain controllers?
You can view the event logs for domain controllers by setting up audit logging
for the domain .
What should I expect during the maintenance of a domain controller? Is there any downtime during the maintenance?
Managed Microsoft AD ensures that there are at least two domain controllers
running on each region for a domain in different availability zones. So, the
domain remains available during patching. For more information, see
Patching .
What is the timeline for applying security patches on domain controllers?
Managed Microsoft AD targets different timelines to apply different types
of patches on domain controllers. For more information, see Patching
schedule .
Can I restore my Active Directory data after a failure?
Managed Microsoft AD supports on-demand and automatic backups for your
domain. You can use any of these backup types to perform an authoritative
restore , which
returns the domain to a previous point in time. For more information, see Back
up and restore your domain .
Can I extend the Active Directory schema?
Yes, you can extend the Active Directory
schema of your
Managed Microsoft AD domain. For more information, see About schema
extension .
Which time server do the domain controllers in Managed Microsoft AD use?
The domain controllers in Managed Microsoft AD sync their time with the
metadata.google.internal time server. For more information, see Configure NTP
on a VM .
Do I need to create a separate project for each Managed Microsoft AD domain?
No, you don't need separate Google Cloud projects. By default, you can
create two independent domains in the same project. Contact
support to increase the number of
independent domains that you can create in the same project.
