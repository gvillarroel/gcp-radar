1 character minimum, 63 characters maximum
Only contains letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens
createTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Output only. The creation timestamp of the clip resource.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
startTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Output only. The timestamp when the clip request starts to be processed.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
updateTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Output only. The update timestamp of the clip resource.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
labels
map (key: string, value: string)
The labels associated with this resource. Each label is a key-value pair.
An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" } .
state
enum ( State )
Output only. The state of the clip.
outputUri
string
Specify the outputUri to determine where to place the clip segments and clip manifest files in Cloud Storage. The manifests specified in clipManifests fields will be placed under this URI. The exact URI of the generated manifests will be provided in clipManifests.output_uri for each manifest. Example: "outputUri": "gs://my-bucket/clip-outputs" "clipManifests.output_uri": "gs://my-bucket/clip-outputs/main.m3u8"
error
object ( Status )
Output only. An error object that describes the reason for the failure. This property only presents when state is FAILED .
slices[]
object ( Slice )
The specified ranges of segments to generate a clip.
clipManifests[]
object ( ClipManifest )
Required. A list of clip manifests. Currently only one clip manifest is allowed.
outputType
enum ( OutputType )
Optional. OutputType of the clip. If not specified, the default value is MANIFEST.
State
State of clipping operation.
Enums
STATE_UNSPECIFIED
State is not specified.
PENDING
The operation is pending to be picked up by the server.
CREATING
The server admitted this create clip request, and outputs are under processing.
SUCCEEDED
Outputs are available in the specified Cloud Storage bucket. For additional information, see the outputs field.
FAILED
The operation has failed. For additional information, see the error field.
Slice
Slice represents a slice of the requested clip.
JSON representation
{
// Union field kind can be only one of the following:
"timeSlice" : {
object ( TimeSlice )
}
// End of list of possible types for union field kind .
}
Fields
Union field kind . The allowlist forms of a slice. kind can be only one of the following:
timeSlice
object ( TimeSlice )
A slice in form of a tuple of Unix epoch time.
TimeSlice
TimeSlice represents a tuple of Unix epoch timestamps that specifies a time range.
JSON representation
{
"markinTime" : string ,
"markoutTime" : string
}
Fields
markinTime
string ( Timestamp format)
The mark-in Unix epoch time in the original live stream manifest.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
markoutTime
string ( Timestamp format)

manifestKey
string
Required. A unique key that identifies a manifest config in the parent channel. This key is the same as channel.manifests.key for the selected manifest.
outputUri
string
Output only. The output URI of the generated clip manifest. This field will be populated when the clips.create request is accepted.
