This page shows how to create a Google Cloud project, enable the
Live Stream API, create
authentication credentials , and grant
your account one or more
IAM roles . This page also shows how
to create a Cloud Storage bucket to hold the live stream output files and
how to install an encoder to generate input streams that the API processes.
Create a project
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Live Stream API:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable livestream.googleapis.com
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/livestream.editor
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.

USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Note: Add the IAM role roles/storage.admin to your Google Account for more
control over your project's Cloud Storage buckets.
Create a Cloud Storage bucket
Create a Cloud Storage bucket to hold the live stream manifest and segment
files.
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage
Buckets page.
Go to Buckets
Click add_box Create .
On the Create a bucket page, enter your bucket information. To go to the next
step, click Continue .
In the Get started section, do the following:
Enter a globally unique name that meets the
bucket naming requirements .
To add a
bucket label ,
expand the Labels section ( expand_more ),
click add_box
Add label , and specify a key and a value for your label.
In the Choose where to store your data section, do the following:
Select a Location type .
Choose a location where your bucket's data is permanently stored from the Location type drop-down menu.
If you select the dual-region location type, you can
also choose to enable turbo replication by using the
relevant checkbox.
To set up cross-bucket replication , select
Add cross-bucket replication via Storage Transfer Service and
follow these steps:
Set up cross-bucket replication
In the Bucket menu, select a bucket.
In the Replication settings section,
click Configure to configure settings for the
replication job.
The Configure cross-bucket replication pane
appears.
To filter objects to replicate by object name prefix,
enter a prefix that you want to include or exclude objects from, then click add
Add a prefix .
To set a storage class for the replicated objects,
select a storage class from the Storage class menu.
If you skip this step, the replicated objects will use the
destination bucket's storage class by default.
Click Done .
In the Choose how to store your data section, do the following:
In the Set a default class section, select the following:
Standard .
To enable hierarchical namespace , in the
Optimize storage for data-intensive workloads section, select
Enable hierarchical namespace on this bucket .
Note: You cannot enable hierarchical namespace in existing
buckets.
In the Choose how to control access to objects section, select
whether or not your bucket enforces public access prevention ,
and select an access control method for your bucket's objects.
Note: You cannot change the Prevent public access setting if this setting is enforced at an organization policy .
In the Choose how to protect object data section, do the
following:
Select any of the options under Data protection that you
want to set for your bucket.
To enable soft delete , click the
Soft delete policy (For data recovery) checkbox,
and specify the number of days you want to retain objects
after deletion.
To set Object Versioning , click the
Object versioning (For version control) checkbox,
and specify the maximum number of versions per object and the number of days after which
the noncurrent versions expire.
To enable the retention policy on objects and buckets, click the Retention (For compliance) checkbox, and then do the following:
To enable Object Retention Lock , click the
Enable object retention checkbox.
To enable Bucket Lock , click the Set bucket retention policy checkbox, and choose a unit of time and a length of time for your retention period.
To choose how your object data will be encrypted, expand the
Data encryption section ( expand_more ), and select a
Data encryption method .
Click Create .
Command line
Create a Cloud Storage bucket:
gcloud storage buckets create gs:// BUCKET_NAME
Replace BUCKET_NAME with a bucket name
that meets the bucket naming requirements .
Install an encoder
To use the API, you need an encoder to generate input streams
that the API processes.
Install ffmpeg as this page
covers how to use ffmpeg to generate input streams. You can install this in
Cloud Shell using the following command.
sudo apt install ffmpeg
