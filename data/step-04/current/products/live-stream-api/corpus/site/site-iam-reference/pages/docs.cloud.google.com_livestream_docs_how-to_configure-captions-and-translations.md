Configure automatic captions and translations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to configure AI-generated captions and translated
captions (that is, translations) for a live stream.
AI-generated captions and translations are supported for HLS and DASH live
streams.
Before you begin
This page assumes that you have completed the steps in the Before you begin
section of the
Quickstart for an HLS live stream or the
Quickstart for an MPEG-DASH live stream .
Supported locations
Language codes for AI-generated captions are supported on a per-location basis.

The AI-generated translation feature is only supported on us-west1 and
europe-west1 . All supported language codes for AI-generated captions are
supported as source and target language codes for AI-generated translations.
Use either us-west1 or europe-west1 for all API requests on this page.
Create the input endpoint
To create the input endpoint, use the
projects.locations.inputs.create method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your Google Cloud project
number; this is located in the Project number field on the
IAM Settings page
LOCATION : the location in which to create the input
endpoint; use one of the supported regions

INPUT_ID : a user-defined identifier for the new input
endpoint to create (to which you send your input stream). This value must be 1-63 characters, begin and end with [a-z0-9] , and
can contain dashes (-) between characters. For example, my-input .
Request JSON body:
{
"type": "RTMP_PUSH"
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json .
Run the following command in the terminal to create or overwrite
this file in the current directory:
cat > request.json
Then execute the following command to send your REST request:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://livestream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /inputs?inputId= INPUT_ID "
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json .
Run the following command in the terminal to create or overwrite
this file in the current directory:
@'
{
"type": "RTMP_PUSH"
}
'@ | Out-File -FilePath request.json -Encoding utf8
Then execute the following command to send your REST request:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://livestream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /inputs?inputId= INPUT_ID " | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID ",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.video.livestream.v1.OperationMetadata",
"createTime": CREATE_TIME ,
"target": "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /inputs/ INPUT_ID ",
"verb": "create",
"requestedCancellation": false,
"apiVersion": "v1"
},
"done": false
}
Copy the returned OPERATION_ID to
use in the next section.
Check for the result
Use the projects.locations.operations.get method to check if
the input endpoint has been created. If the response contains "done: false" ,
repeat the command until the response contains "done: true" . Creating the
first input endpoint in a region may take up to 10 minutes.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your Google Cloud project
number; this is located in the Project number field on the
IAM Settings page
LOCATION : the location where your input endpoint is
located; use one of the supported regions

}
}
Find the uri field and copy the returned
INPUT_STREAM_URI to use later
in the Send the input stream section.
Create the channel
To create the channel, use the
projects.locations.channels.create method.
Note the following in the channel configuration:
One
ElementaryStream , a TextStream , is
used for the captions.
{
"key" : "webvtt_english_ai" ,
"textStream" : {
"codec" : "webvtt" ,
"displayName" : "English (AI captioned)" ,
"languageCode" : "en-US" ,
"mapping" : [
{
"inputTrack" : 1 // audio track number
}
]
}
}
The TextStream
codec field must be set to webvtt .
The TextStream
mapping field uses
inputTrack to designate the input audio
track to generate captions from. The mapping must not include a
inputCeaChannel field, which is only used for user-supplied closed
captions.
Set the languageCode to the language spoken
in the audio track.
The elementary stream is used to create a MuxStream with key
vtt_english_ai .
{
"key" : "vtt_english_ai" ,
"container" : "vtt" ,
"elementaryStreams" : [
"webvtt_english_ai"
],
"segmentSettings" : {
"segmentDuration" : "2s"
}
}
This mux stream is then referenced in both HLS and DASH
manifests .
{
"fileName" : "main.m3u8" ,
"type" : "HLS" ,
"muxStreams" : [
"mux_video_ts" ,
"vtt_english_ai"
],
"maxSegmentCount" : 5
}
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your Google Cloud project
number; this is located in the Project number field on the
IAM Settings page
LOCATION : the location in which to create the
channel; use one of the supported regions

CHANNEL_ID : a user-defined identifier for the channel to
create; this value must be 1-63 characters, begin and end with [a-z0-9] , and
can contain dashes (-) between characters

CHANNEL_ID : a user-defined identifier for the channel
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d "" \ "https://livestream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /channels/ CHANNEL_ID :start"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or

.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://livestream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /channels/ CHANNEL_ID :start" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
Response
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID ",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.video.livestream.v1.OperationMetadata",

},
"done": false
}
To determine if the channel has started, get the channel
information as done previously. The response should contain the following:
{
...
"streamingState": "AWAITING_INPUT"
...
}
Send the input stream
Now that the channel is ready, send an input stream to the input
endpoint to generate the live stream. You can download an MP4 (or other
TEST_VOD_FILE ) with captions and
use ffmpeg to send it to the input endpoint.
Open a new terminal window. Run the following command, using the
INPUT_STREAM_URI from the
Check for the result section:
ffmpeg -re -stream_loop -1 -i " TEST_VOD_FILE " \
-c:v copy -c:a aac -strict 2 -f "flv" " INPUT_STREAM_URI "
Note: Use format flv if the input endpoint uses the RTMP protocol. Use
mpegts for the SRT protocol.
Verify the captions in the output manifest
Run the following command to see the contents of the generated HLS manifest:
gcloud storage cat gs:// BUCKET_NAME /main.m3u8
The AI-generated webvtt English captions show up in the output manifest
similar to the following:
#EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=SUBTITLES,GROUP-ID="sub",LANGUAGE="en-US",NAME="English (AI captioned)",AUTOSELECT=YES,DEFAULT=YES,FORCED=NO,URI="vtt_english_ai/index-1.m3u8"
Stop the channel
You must stop a channel before you update the channel configuration.
Use the
projects.locations.channels.stop method to stop the channel.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:

Update the channel configuration for a translation
Update the channel configuration to include translated captions (that is, a
translation).
Note the following additions to the channel configuration:
One
ElementaryStream , a TextStream , is
used for the captions for a single translated language.
{
"key" : "webvtt_spanish_ai" ,
"textStream" : {
"codec" : "webvtt" ,
"displayName" : "Spanish (AI captioned)" ,
"languageCode" : "es-MX" ,
"mapping" : [
{
"inputTrack" : 1 , // audio track number
"fromLanguageCode" : "en-US" // original audio in English
}
]
}
}
Set languageCode to the chosen translated
language.
Set fromLanguageCode to the
original source language in the audio track.
The elementary stream is used to create a MuxStream with key
vtt_spanish_ai .
{
"key" : "vtt_spanish_ai" ,
"container" : "vtt" ,
"elementaryStreams" : [
"webvtt_spanish_ai"
],
"segmentSettings" : {
"segmentDuration" : "2s"
}
}
This mux stream is then referenced in both HLS and DASH
manifests .
{
"fileName" : "main.m3u8" ,
"type" : "HLS" ,
"muxStreams" : [
"mux_video_ts" ,
"vtt_english_ai" ,
"vtt_spanish_ai"
],
"maxSegmentCount" : 5
}
To update the channel, use the
projects.locations.channels.patch method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:

Verify the translation in the output manifest
Run the following command to see the contents of the generated HLS manifest:
gcloud storage cat gs:// BUCKET_NAME /main.m3u8
The AI-generated webvtt English and Spanish captions show up in the output
manifest similar to the following:
#EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=SUBTITLES,GROUP-ID="sub",LANGUAGE="en-US",NAME="English (AI captioned)",AUTOSELECT=YES,DEFAULT=YES,FORCED=NO,URI="vtt_english_ai/index-1.m3u8"
#EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=SUBTITLES,GROUP-ID="sub",LANGUAGE="es-MX",NAME="Spanish (AI captioned)",AUTOSELECT=NO,DEFAULT=NO,FORCED=NO,URI="vtt_spanish_ai/index-1.m3u8"
Configure AI-generated transcripts for distribution
Before configuring AI-generated captions and translations for distribution,
familiarize yourself with how to
distribute live streams to remote endpoints .
To distribute AI-generated captions and translations to remote endpoints,
don't reference the text streams in the webvtt format
that were configured previously when creating channel with AI-generated captions
and updating channel for translation .
Text streams for distribution must be embedded captions, with the
codec set to cea608 or cea708 .
In the channel configuration, consider the following:
One
ElementaryStream , a TextStream , is
used for the captions, and another ElementaryStream , a
TextStream , is used for the translation.
{
"key" : "embedded_english_ai" ,
"textStream" : {
"codec" : "cea608" ,
"displayName" : "English (AI captioned)" ,
"languageCode" : "en-US" ,
"outputCeaChannel" : "CC1" , // closed caption channel that will contain AI-generated English captions
"mapping" : [
{
"inputTrack" : 1 // audio track number
}
]
}
}
{
"key" : "embedded_spanish_ai" ,
"textStream" : {
"codec" : "cea608" ,
"displayName" : "Spanish (AI captioned)" ,
"languageCode" : "es-MX" ,
"outputCeaChannel" : "CC2" , // closed caption channel that will contain AI-generated Spanish captions
"mapping" : [
{
"inputTrack" : 1 , // audio track number
"fromLanguageCode" : "en-US" // original audio in English
}
]
}
}
The TextStream
codec field must be set to either cea608 or cea708 .
The TextStream
mapping field uses
inputTrack to designate the input audio
track to generate captions from. The mapping must not include a
inputCeaChannel field, which is only used for user-supplied closed
captions.
Set the outputCeaChannel to the
channel of closed caption to contain AI-generated transcripts in the
distribution stream.
Set the languageCode to the language spoken
in the audio track.
The elementary streams are included in the elementaryStreams
field of the DistributionStream object.
{
"distributionStreams" : [
{
"key" : "ds1" ,
"container" : "ts" , // to be used with an SRT distribution
"elementaryStreams" : [
"es_video" ,
"es_audio" ,
"embedded_english_ai" , // distribute both English
"embedded_spanish_ai" // and Spanish captions
]
},
{
"key" : "ds2" ,
"container" : "flv" , // to be used with an RTMP distribution
"elementaryStreams" : [
"es_video" ,
"es_audio" ,
"embedded_spanish_ai" // only distribute Spanish captions
]
}
]
}
Complete channel creation by following distribute live stream to remote endpoint guide .
Advanced configurations
Set AutoTranscriptionConfig at the channel level
to further tune the AI-generated text streams to your needs.
Caption display timing
By default, AI-generated captions are displayed asynchronously with the audio
and video. Set the DisplayTiming
field in AutoTranscriptionConfig to SYNC to display them synchronously.
{
"autoTranscriptionConfig" : {
"displayTiming" : "SYNC"
}
}
Displaying captions synchronously decreases the viewing latency between
audio and text but increases the overall end-to-end media latency.
Quality presets
Use the QualityPreset field in
AutoTranscriptionConfig to configure the quality preferences for AI-generated
text streams.
For example, you can further reduce the latency of text stream generation by
setting:
{
"autoTranscriptionConfig" : {
"qualityPreset" : "LOW_LATENCY"
}
}
Clean up
Stop the channel
Use the
projects.locations.channels.stop method to stop the channel.
You must stop the channel before you can delete it.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your Google Cloud project
number; this is located in the Project number field on the
IAM Settings page
LOCATION : the location where your channel is
located; use one of the supported regions
