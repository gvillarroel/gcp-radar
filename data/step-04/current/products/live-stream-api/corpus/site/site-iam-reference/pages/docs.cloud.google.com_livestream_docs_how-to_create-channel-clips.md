Create and manage channel clips
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to create and manage Live Stream API channel clips.
A channel clip is a sub-resource of a channel. You can use a channel clip to
create video on demand (VOD) files from a live stream. These VOD files are
saved to Cloud Storage. For more information, see
Create VOD clips from a live stream .
Set up your Google Cloud project and authentication
If you have not created a
Google Cloud project and credentials, see
Before you begin .
Prerequisites
You must create the following resources before creating a channel clip:
Create an input endpoint
Create a channel
with a retention config
Create a channel clip
Make sure to start the channel
and start streaming content to the channel before creating a channel clip.
To create a channel clip, use the
projects.locations.channels.clips.create
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your Google Cloud project
number; this is located in the Project number field on the
IAM Settings page
LOCATION : the location where your channel is
located; use one of the supported regions

CHANNEL_ID : a user-defined identifier for the channel
CLIP_ID : a user-defined identifier for the VOD clip
MARK_IN_TIME : the mark-in Unix epoch time in
the original live stream manifest; uses a timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format (for example,
2014-10-02T15:01:23Z )
MARK_OUT_TIME : the mark-out Unix epoch time
in the original live stream manifest; uses a timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format (for
example, 2014-10-02T15:01:23Z )
BUCKET_NAME : the name of the Cloud Storage
bucket you created to hold the VOD clip manifest and segment files; you can use the same bucket
you created for the live stream manifest or a different bucket; you can also append a directory
name to the bucket name (for example my-bucket/vod-clip )
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json .
Run the following command in the terminal to create or overwrite
this file in the current directory:
cat > request.json BUCKET_NAME ",
"clipManifests":[
{
"manifestKey": "manifest_hls"
}
],
"slices":[
{
"timeSlice": {
"markinTime": " MARK_IN_TIME ",
"markoutTime": " MARK_OUT_TIME "
}
}
]
}
EOF
Then execute the following command to send your REST request:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://livestream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /channels/ CHANNEL_ID /clips?clipId= CLIP_ID "
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json .
Run the following command in the terminal to create or overwrite
this file in the current directory:
@'
{
"outputUri": "gs:// BUCKET_NAME ",
"clipManifests":[
{
"manifestKey": "manifest_hls"
}
],
"slices":[
{
"timeSlice": {
"markinTime": " MARK_IN_TIME ",
"markoutTime": " MARK_OUT_TIME "
}
}
]
}
'@ | Out-File -FilePath request.json -Encoding utf8
Then execute the following command to send your REST request:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://livestream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /channels/ CHANNEL_ID /clips?clipId= CLIP_ID " | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID ",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.video.livestream.v1.OperationMetadata",
"createTime": CREATE_TIME ,
"target": "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /channels/ CHANNEL_ID /clips/ CLIP_ID ",
"verb": "create",
"requestedCancellation": false,
"apiVersion": "v1"
},
"done": false
}
This command creates a long-running operation (LRO) that you can use
to track the progress of your request. See
Manage long-running operations
for more information.
Get channel clip details
To get the details of a channel clip, use the
projects.locations.channels.clips.get
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:

number; this is located in the Project number field on the
IAM Settings page

files specified by the
outputUri ;
the Live Stream API does not delete these files from Cloud Storage.

not deleted.
