Create and manage DVR sessions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to create and manage Live Stream API digital video
recorder (DVR) sessions. A DVR session is a sub-resource of a channel. You can
use a DVR session to record a future live stream. For more information, see
the separate guide
Create a DVR session .
Set up your Google Cloud project and authentication
If you have not created a
Google Cloud project and credentials, see
Before you begin .
Prerequisites
You must create the following resources before creating a DVR session:
Create an input endpoint
Create a channel
with a retention config and manifest key
Create a DVR session
To create a DVR session, use the
projects.locations.channels.dvrSessions.create
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your Google Cloud project
number; this is located in the Project number field on the
IAM Settings page
LOCATION : the location where your channel is
located; use one of the supported regions
Show locations

CHANNEL_ID : a user-defined identifier for the channel
DVR_SESSION_ID : a user-defined identifier for the DVR session
INTERVAL_START_TIME : the mark-in Unix epoch time in
the original live stream manifest; uses a timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format (for example,
2014-10-02T15:01:23Z )
INTERVAL_END_TIME : the mark-out Unix epoch time
in the original live stream manifest; uses a timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format (for
example, 2014-10-02T15:01:23Z )
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json .
Run the following command in the terminal to create or overwrite
this file in the current directory:
cat > request.json INTERVAL_START_TIME ",
"endTime": " INTERVAL_END_TIME "
}
}
]
}
EOF
Then execute the following command to send your REST request:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://livestream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /channels/ CHANNEL_ID /dvrSessions?dvr_session_id= DVR_SESSION_ID "
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json .
Run the following command in the terminal to create or overwrite
this file in the current directory:
@'
{
"dvrManifests":[
{
"manifestKey": "manifest_hls"
}
],
"dvrWindows":[
{
"timeInterval": {
"startTime": " INTERVAL_START_TIME ",
"endTime": " INTERVAL_END_TIME "
}
}
]
}
'@ | Out-File -FilePath request.json -Encoding utf8
Then execute the following command to send your REST request:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://livestream.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /channels/ CHANNEL_ID /dvrSessions?dvr_session_id= DVR_SESSION_ID " | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID ",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.video.livestream.v1.OperationMetadata",

"verb": "create",
"requestedCancellation": false,
"apiVersion": "v1"
},
"done": false
}
This command creates a long-running operation (LRO) that you can use
to track the progress of your request. See
Manage long-running operations
for more information.
Get DVR session details
To get the details of a DVR session, use the
projects.locations.channels.dvrSessions.get
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your Google Cloud project
number; this is located in the Project number field on the
IAM Settings page
LOCATION : the location where your channel is
located; use one of the supported regions

To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or

"dvrWindows": [
{

"startTime": " INTERVAL_START_TIME ",
"endTime": " INTERVAL_END_TIME "
}
}
]
}
DVR sessions and the generated manifests are removed when the first segment
expires per the parent channel's retentionConfig . If you want the session to
last beyond the configured retention window,
create a channel clip instead.
Update a DVR session
To update a DVR session, use the
projects.locations.channels.dvrSessions.patch
method.
The following example updates the DVR time windows used by the DVR session. Not
all fields can be updated; see the
list of supported fields .
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your Google Cloud project
number; this is located in the Project number field on the
IAM Settings page

}
This command creates a long-running operation (LRO) that you can use
to track the progress of your request. See
Manage long-running operations
for more information.
Update requests are rejected if the DVR session state is
LIVE and the update could overwrite the current DVR manifest. The only
exception to this is when the update makes the DVR session shorter (for example,
changing the end time to now or sometime in the past); in this case, the DVR
session stops immediately and the DVR session goes into the COOLDOWN state.
After the 60-second cool down period, the DVR manifest is overwritten to reflect
the updated start and end times.
List DVR sessions
To list all of the DVR sessions you created for a channel, use the
projects.locations.channels.dvrSessions.list
method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER : your Google Cloud project
number; this is located in the Project number field on the
IAM Settings page

located; use one of the supported regions

The resources created in the Cloud Storage bucket are deleted according to
the retention config .
