This page shows how to create an admin cluster for use in Google Distributed Cloud
topology domains . The admin
cluster manages user clusters that run your workloads. Google Distributed Cloud
version 1.31 or higher is required to use topology domains.
Setting up a topology domain requires that you enable
advanced cluster .
Note the following limitations with the advanced cluster preview:
You can enable advanced cluster at cluster creation time for new 1.31
clusters only.
After advanced cluster is enabled, you won't be able to upgrade the cluster
to 1.32. Only enable advanced cluster in a test environment.
This page is for Admins, Architects, and Operators who set up,
monitor, and manage the tech infrastructure. To learn more about common roles
and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
For more details about the admin cluster, see the
installation overview .
Procedure overview
These are the primary steps involved in creating an admin cluster:
Fill in your admin configuration file
Specify the details for your new admin cluster by completing an admin cluster
configuration file.
Fill in your vSphere infrastructure configuration file
Specify the details about your topology domains in a vSphere infrastructure
configuration file.
Fill in your IP block file
Specify the IP addresses for the gateway, netmask, and control-plane nodes
in an IP block file.
Get OS images
Download the normal Google Distributed Cloud bundle. Then run gkectl prepare , which
imports the OS images to vSphere, and pushes container images to the private
registry if applicable.
Create an admin cluster.
Use gkectl to create a new admin cluster as specified in your
completed configuration files. When Google Distributed Cloud creates an admin
cluster, it deploys a Kubernetes in Docker (kind)
cluster to temporarily host the Kubernetes controllers needed to create the
admin cluster. This transient cluster is called a bootstrap cluster . User
clusters are created and upgraded by their managing admin without the use
of a bootstrap cluster.
Verify that your admin cluster is running.
Use kubectl to view your cluster nodes.
At the end of this procedure, you will have a running admin cluster that you can
use to create and manage user clusters in topology domains.
Before you begin
Make sure you have set up and can sign in to your admin workstation as
described in
Create an admin workstation .
The admin workstation has the tools you need to create your admin cluster.
Do all the steps in this document on your admin workstation.
Review the
IP addresses planning document .
Ensure that you have enough IP addresses available for the three control-plane
nodes and a control-plane VIP.
Configure your load balancer for
manual load balancing . Your
load balancer must be set up before you create the admin cluster.
Look ahead at the
privateRegistry
section, and decide whether you want to use a public or private registry for
Google Distributed Cloud components.
Look ahead at the
osImageType
field, and decide what type of operating system you want to run on your admin
cluster nodes.
If your organization requires outbound traffic to pass through a proxy
server, make sure to
allowlist required
APIs and the Artifact Registry address.
Gather the information that you need to access each instance of vCenter
Server. You need this information to fill in the
Secret
section and the
VSphereInfraConfig.credentials.vCenters
section in the vSphere infrastructure configuration file. See the following
for how to obtain the needed information:
vCenter user account privileges
Determine your vCenter server address
Getting your vCenter CA root certificate
Fill in your admin cluster configuration file
If you used gkeadm to create your admin workstation, it generated a
configuration file named admin-cluster.yaml .
If you didn't use gkeadm to create your admin workstation, then generate
admin-cluster.yaml by running this command on your admin workstation:
gkectl create-config admin
This configuration file is for creating your admin cluster.
Familiarize yourself with the configuration file by scanning the
admin cluster configuration file
document. You might want to keep this document open in a separate tab or window,
because you will refer to it as you complete the following steps.
name
If you want to specify a name for your admin cluster, fill in the
name field.
bundlePath
The bundle is a zipped file that contains cluster components. It is included
with the admin workstation. This field is already filled in for you.
enableAdvancedCluster
Set enableAdvancedCluster
to true . This enables advanced clusters, which is required to set up
topolog domains.
infraConfigFilePath
Add the full path to the
vSphere infrastructure configuration file
in the infraConfigFilePath
field.
vCenter
Remove this entire section. Instead, you configure the vCenter Server
information in the vSphere infrastructure configuration file.
network
Remove the following from the configuration file:
The entire network.hostConfig section. This information is configured in
the vSphere infrastructure configuration file per topology domain.
The network.vCenter.networkName field. This field is configured in
the vSphere infrastructure configuration file per topology domain.
The entire network.controlPlaneIPBlock section. The IP addresses for the
gateway, netmask, and the control plane nodes are configured in an
IP block file .
Set network.ipMode.ipBlockFilePath to the path to the IP block file.
Set network.ipMode.type
to static .
The
network.podCIDR
and
network.serviceCIDR
fields have prepopulated values that you can leave unchanged unless they
conflict with addresses already being used in your network. Kubernetes uses
these ranges to assign IP addresses to Pods and Services in your cluster.
loadBalancer
Set loadBalancer.kind to "ManualLB" , and remove the
manualLB
section.
Set aside a VIP for the Kubernetes API server of your admin cluster. Provide
your VIP as the value for
loadBalancer.vips.controlPlaneVIP
For more information, see
VIPs in the admin cluster subnet .
antiAffinityGroups
Set
antiAffinityGroups.enabled
to false .
Distributed Resource Scheduler
(DRS) anti-affinity rules aren't supported with topology domains.
adminMaster
If you want to specify CPU and memory for the control-plane nodes of the admin
cluster, fill in the cpus and memoryMB fields in the
adminMaster
section.
Admin clusters must have three control-plane nodes. Set the replicas field
in the adminMaster section to 3 .
If you want to specify a specific topology domain for the control
plane nodes to use, add the topology domain name to the
adminMaster.topologyDomains
field. If you don't specify a name here, you must set a name in
vSphereInfraConfig.defaultTopologyDomain
in the vSphere infrastructure configuration file.
proxy
If the network that will have your admin cluster nodes is behind a proxy server,
fill in the
proxy
section.
privateRegistry
Decide where you want to keep container images for the Google Distributed Cloud
components. The options are:
Artifact Registry
Your own private Docker registry.
If you want to use your own private registry, fill in the
privateRegistry
section.
componentAccessServiceAccountKeyPath
Google Distributed Cloud uses your component access service account to download
cluster components from Artifact Registry. This field holds the path of a JSON
key file for your component access service account.
This field is already filled in for you.
gkeConnect
Register your admin cluster
to a Google Cloud fleet by filling in the
gkeConnect
section. The ID in gkeConnect.projectID must be the same as the ID set in
stackdriver.projectID and cloudAuditLogging.projectID . If the project IDs
aren't the same, cluster creation fails.
You can optionally specify a region where the fleet and Connect
services run in gkeConnect.location . If you don't include this field, the
cluster uses the global instances of these services.
If you include gkeConnect.location , the region that you specify must be the
same as the region configured in cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation ,
stackdriver.clusterLocation , and gkeOnPremAPI.location . If the regions
aren't the same, cluster creation fails.
gkeOnPremAPI
This section describes how clusters are
enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API .
The gkectl command line tool is the only available
cluster lifecycle management tool
for clusters using topology domains. Although the Google Cloud console, the
Google Cloud CLI, and Terraform aren't supported for clusters using topology
domains, you can optionally enroll the cluster in the GKE On-Prem API
when it is created.
If the GKE On-Prem API is enabled in your Google Cloud project, all clusters
in the project are enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API automatically in the region
configured in stackdriver.clusterLocation . The gkeOnPremAPI.location region
must be the same as the region specified in cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation ,
gkeConnect.location , and stackdriver.clusterLocation . If the regions aren't
the same, cluster creation fails.
If you want to enroll all clusters in the project in the GKE On-Prem API,
be sure to do the steps in
Before you begin to
activate and use the GKE On-Prem API in the project.
If you don't want to enroll the cluster in the GKE On-Prem API, include
this section and set gkeOnPremAPI.enabled to false . If you don't
want to enroll any clusters in the project, disable
gkeonprem.googleapis.com (the service name for the GKE On-Prem API)
in the project. For instructions, see
Disabling services .
stackdriver
Fill in the
stackdriver
section to enable
Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring
for your cluster.
Note the following requirements:
The ID in stackdriver.projectID must be the same as the ID
in gkeConnect.projectID and cloudAuditLogging.projectID .
The Google Cloud region set in stackdriver.clusterLocation must be the same
as the region set in cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation and
gkeConnect.location . Additionally, if gkeOnPremAPI.enabled is true , the
same region must be set in gkeOnPremAPI.location .
If the project IDs and regions aren't the same, cluster creation fails.
cloudAuditLogging
If you want to integrate the audit logs from your cluster's Kubernetes API
server with Cloud Audit Logs, fill in the
cloudAuditLogging
section.
Note the following requirements for new clusters:
Because enableAdvancedCluster is set to true , you must specify the
same path in cloudAuditLogging.serviceAccountKeyPath and
stackdriver.serviceAccountKeyPath .
The ID in cloudAuditLogging.projectID must be the same as the ID
in gkeConnect.projectID and stackdriver.projectID .
The Google Cloud region set in cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation must be
the same as the region set in stackdriver.clusterLocation and
gkeConnect.location (if the field is included in your configuration file).
Additionally, if gkeOnPremAPI.enabled is true , the same region must be
set in gkeOnPremAPI.location .
If the project IDs and regions aren't the same, cluster creation fails.
clusterBackup
Remove this section.
Backing up the admin cluster ,
to a vSphere datastore isn't supported.
autoRepair
If you want to
enable automatic node repair
for your admin cluster, set
autoRepair.enabled
to true .
secretsEncryption
Because enableAdvancedCluster is set to true , remove this section.
osImageType
Set the
osImageType .
to either ubuntu_cgroupv2 and ubuntu_containerd .
preparedSecrets
Remove the preparedSecrets field.
Prepared credentials
aren't supported when topology domains is enabled.

serviceAccountKeyPath: "log-mon-sa-2203040617.json"
disableVsphereResourceMetrics: false
autoRepair:
enabled: true
osImageType: "ubuntu_containerd"
Fill in your vSphere infrastructure configuration file
Copy the template for the
vSphere infrastructure configuration file
to the file in the directory that you specified in the infraConfigFilePath
field in the admin cluster configuration file. There is only one vSphere
infrastructure configuration file for the admin cluster and all managed user
clusters.
Secret
Fill in the Secret
section in the vSphere infrastructure configuration file. This section describes
the vSphere credentials Secret which stores credentials of each vCenter Server.
VSphereInfraConfig.name
Fill in the VSphereInfraConfig,name field.
VSphereInfraConfig.credentials.vCenters
For each Secret , add a corresponding
VSphereInfraConfig.credentials.vCenters section.
VSphereInfraConfig,topologyDomains
Fill in the
VSphereInfraConfig.topologyDomains section to
define the topology domains.
Fill in your IP block file
Copy the template for the
IP block file to the file in the
directory that you specified in the network.ipMode.ipBlockFilePath field
in the admin cluster configuration file. Add the IP addresses for the gateway,
netmask, and the three control plane nodes. For each control-plane node IP
address, add isControlPlane: true as shown in the
example for topology domains .
Get OS images
Download the normal Google Distributed Cloud bundle to the admin workstation:
gcloud storage cp gs://gke-on-prem-release/gke-onprem-bundle/ VERSION /gke-onprem-vsphere- VERSION .tgz /var/lib/gke/bundles/gke-onprem-vsphere- VERSION .tgz
Replace VERSION with the Google Distributed Cloud
version that you want to install.
This command downloads the normal bundle. Don't download the full bundle
because it isn't supported with advanced clusters.
Run gkectl prepare to initialize your vSphere environment:
gkectl prepare --config ADMIN_CLUSTER_CONFIG
Replace ADMIN_CLUSTER_CONFIG with the path of the
admin cluster configuration.
The gkectl prepare command performs the following preparatory tasks:
Imports OS images to vSphere and marks them as VM templates.
If you are using a private Docker registry, pushes the container images to
your registry.
Optionally, validates the container images' build attestations,
thereby verifying the images were built and signed by Google and are ready for
deployment.
Note: If you're using internal DNS names, or your workstation cannot access
Google public DNS addresses (8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4), you must specify your
internal nameserver in
/etc/resolv.conf .
Create the admin cluster
Create the admin cluster:
gkectl create admin --config ADMIN_CLUSTER_CONFIG
Resume creation of the admin cluster after a failure
If the admin cluster creation fails or is canceled, you can run the create command again:
gkectl create admin --config ADMIN_CLUSTER_CONFIG
Locate the admin cluster kubeconfig file
The gkectl create admin command creates a kubeconfig file named
kubeconfig in the current directory. You will need this kubeconfig file
later to interact with your admin cluster.
The kubeconfig file contains the name of your admin cluster. To view the cluster name, you can run:
kubectl config get-clusters --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
The output shows the name of the cluster. For example:
NAME
gke-admin-tqk8x
If you like, you can change the name and location of your kubeconfig file.
Verify that your admin cluster is running
Verify that your admin cluster is running:
kubectl get nodes --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
Replace ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG with the path of your admin cluster
kubeconfig file.
The output shows the admin cluster nodes. For example:
admin-cp-vm-1 Ready control-plane,master ...
admin-cp-vm-2 Ready control-plane,master ...
admin-cp-vm-3 Ready control-plane,master ...
Configure your PodTemplate
The topology label is populated to labels of nodes in the topology domain.
Unless your topology domain setup used the default constraint,
"topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
as the topology key, you need to configure the topology key in the pod
template of you Deployment, StatefulSet, or ReplicaSet, as applicable.
For example, suppose you defined the key in the topology label as
"topology.examplepetstore.com/zone" . In the PodTemplate , you specify the key
as the value for the topologySpreadConstraints.topologyKey field. This lets
the Kubernetes scheduler distribute Pods across the topology domain to ensure
high availability and prevent over-concentration in any single area in case of
failure.
For more information on configuring topologySpreadConstraints , see
Pod Topology Spread Constraints
in the Kubernetes documentation.
Back up files
We recommend that you back up your admin cluster kubeconfig file. That is, copy
the kubeconfig file from your admin workstation to another location. Then if you
lose access to the admin workstation, or if the kubeconfig file on your admin
workstation gets accidentally deleted, you still have access to the admin
cluster.
We also recommend that you back up the private SSH key for your admin cluster.
Then if you lose access to the admin cluster, you can still use SSH to
connect to the admin cluster nodes. This will allow you to troubleshoot and
investigate any issues with connectivity to the admin cluster.
Extract the SSH key from the admin cluster to a file named
admin-cluster-ssh-key :
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get secrets -n kube-system sshkeys \
-o jsonpath='{.data.vsphere_tmp}' | base64 -d > admin-cluster-ssh-key
Now you can back up admin-cluster-ssh-key to another location of your choice.
