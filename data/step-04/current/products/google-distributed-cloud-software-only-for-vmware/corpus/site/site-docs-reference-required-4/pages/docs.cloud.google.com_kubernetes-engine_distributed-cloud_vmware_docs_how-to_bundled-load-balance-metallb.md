Bundled load balancing with MetalLB
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document shows how to configure Google Distributed Cloud to use bundled load
balancing with the
MetalLB load balancer . This document is for
Networking specialists who design and architect the network for their
organization, and install, configure, and support network equipment. To learn
more about common roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud
content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
In Google Distributed Cloud, MetalLB runs in
layer-2 mode .
Example of a MetalLB configuration
Here is an example of a configuration for clusters running the MetalLB load balancer:
MetalLB load balancer configuration
The preceding diagram shows a MetalLB deployment. MetalLB runs directly on the
cluster nodes. In this example, the admin cluster and user cluster are on two
separate VLANs, and each cluster is in a separate subnet:
Cluster

Admin cluster
172.16.20.0/24
User cluster
172.16.40.0/24
admin-cluster.yaml
The following portion of an admin cluster configuration file shows the
configuration seen in the preceding diagram of:

The configuration in the preceding example specifies a set of addresses
available for Services. When an application developer creates a Service of type
LoadBalancer in the user cluster, the MetalLB controller will choose an
IP address from this pool.
user-cluster-ipblock.yaml
The following example of an IP block file shows the designation of IP addresses
for the worker nodes in the user cluster. This includes an extra IP address to
use during cluster upgrades, updates, and auto repair.

Set up MetalLB
Open firewall ports
MetalLB uses the
Go memberlist library
to do leader election. The memberlist library uses TCP port 7946 and UDP port
7946 to exchange information. Make sure those ports are accessible for incoming and
outgoing traffic on all load-balancer nodes.
Enable MetalLB for a new admin cluster
In your
admin cluster configuration
file ,
set loadBalancer.kind to "MetalLB" .
loadBalancer:
kind: "MetalLB"
Fill in the rest of your admin cluster configuration file, and create your
admin cluster as described in
Create an admin cluster .
Specify address pools
The MetalLB controller assigns IP addresses for Services. When an application
developer creates a Service of type LoadBalancer in a user cluster, the MetalLB
controller automatically assigns an IP address for the Service. The MetalLB
controller selects an IP address from an address pool that you specify.
To ensure your user cluster has enough IP addresses, consider the maximum number
of LoadBalancer Services likely to be active. Then, specify enough IP addresses
in the
loadBalancer.metalLB.addressPools
section of your user cluster's configuration file.
Key Point: Because a Service of type LoadBalancer exposes the ingress
proxy , you must include the
ingress
VIP
for your user cluster in one of the address pools.
Addresses in the pool must be in CIDR format or range format. To specify an
individual address, use a /32 CIDR. For example:
addresses :
- "192.0.2.0/26"
- "192.0.2.64-192.0.2.72"
- "192.0.2.75/32"
Exclude IP addresses used for other purposes
Don't include the following IP addresses in any address pool:
Control plane VIPs:
admin cluster
user cluster
Control plane node IP addresses:
admin cluster
user cluster
Gateway IP addresses:
admin cluster
user cluster
IP addresses for Services:
admin cluster
user cluster
IP addresses for Pods:
admin cluster
user cluster
User cluster worker node IP addresses
IP addresses of vCenter servers ,
DNS servers ,
NTP servers ,
and the admin workstation
If you need to adjust the addresses in a pool after the cluster is created, you
can use gkectl update cluster . For more information, see
Update MetalLB .
Enable MetalLB for a new user cluster
In your
user cluster configuration file :
Set loadBalancer.kind to "MetalLB" .
Specify one or more address pools for Services. The ingress VIP must be in
one of these pools.
Set enableLoadBalancer to true for at least one node pool in your cluster.
When set to true , this field lets the MetalLB speaker run on the nodes in
the pool.
Warning: If the IP address for a Service has a high network address
translation (NAT) ingress volume, don't use that node pool for MetalLB.
Instead, use another pool or create a dedicated node pool for MetalLB to use.
Otherwise, using the same node pool as the Service with the high NAT ingress
volume might pose a risk to your workloads running out of memory.
Note the following differences in the behavior of the enableLoadBalancer
field when
enableAdvancedCluster
set to true (advanced cluster enabled): In version 1.31 when advanced
cluster is enabled, this field has no effect because the MetalLB speaker
always runs on the user cluster's control-plane nodes. In version 1.32 when
advanced cluster is enabled, this limitation has been removed, and you must
specify at least one node pool on which the MetalLB speaker runs.
Fill in the rest of your user cluster configuration file, and create your
user cluster as described in
Create a user cluster .
Manual assignment of Service addresses
If you don't want the MetalLB controller to automatically assign IP
addresses from a particular pool to Services, set the manualAssign field of
the pool to true . Then a developer can create a Service of type LoadBalancer
and manually specify one of the addresses from the pool. For example:
loadBalancer:
metalLB:
addressPools:
- name: "my-address-pool-2"
addresses:
- "192.0.2.73-192.0.2.80"
manualAssign: true
Avoiding buggy IP addresses
If you set the avoidBuggyIPs field of an address pool to true , the MetalLB
controller will not use addresses from the pool that end in .0 or .255. This
avoids the problem of buggy consumer devices mistakenly dropping traffic sent
to those special IP addresses. For example:
loadBalancer:
metalLB:
addressPools:
- name: "my-address-pool-1"
addresses:
- "192.0.2.0/24"
avoidBuggyIPs: true
Create a Service of type LoadBalancer
Here are two manifests: one for a Deployment and one for a Service:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: my-deployment
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
greeting: hello
replicas: 3
template:
metadata:
labels:
greeting: hello
spec:
containers:
- name: hello
image: gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: my-service
spec:
type: LoadBalancer
selector:
greeting: hello
ports:
- name: metal-lb-example-port
protocol: TCP
port: 60000
targetPort: 8080
Notice that the Service manifest does not specify an external IP address.
The MetalLB controller will choose an external IP address from the address pool
you specified in the user cluster configuration file.
Save the manifests in a file named my-dep-svc.yaml . Then create the Deployment
and Service objects:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG apply -f my-dep-svc.yaml
View the Service:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG get service my-service --output wide
The output shows the external IP address that was automatically assigned to the
Service. For example:
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE SELECTOR
my-service LoadBalancer 10.96.2.166 192.0.2.2 60000:31914/TCP 28s
Verify that the assigned external IP address was taken from the address pool you
specified in your user cluster configuration file. For example, 192.0.2.2 is in
this address pool:
metalLB:
addressPools:
- name: "address-pool-1"
addresses:
- "192.0.2.0/24"
- "198.51.100.1-198.51.100.3"
Call the Service:
curl EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS :60000
The output displays a Hello, world! message:
Hello, world!
Version: 2.0.0
Update MetalLB
After you create your cluster, you can update the MetalLB address pools and the
enableLoadBalancer field in your node pools. Make the desired changes in the
user cluster configuration file, and then call gkectl update cluster :
gkectl update cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG --config USER_CLUSTER_CONFIG
MetalLB Pods and ConfigMap
The MetalLB controller runs as a Deployment, and the MetalLB speaker runs as a
DaemonSet on nodes in pools that have enableLoadBalancer set to true . The
MetalLB controller manages the IP addresses assigned to Services. The MetalLB
speaker does leader election and announces Service VIPs.
View all MetalLB Pods:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG get pods --namespace kube-system --selector app=metallb
You can use the logs from the MetalLB Pods for troubleshooting.
MetalLB configuration is stored in a ConfigMap in a format known by MetalLB.
Do not change the ConfigMap directly. Instead, use gkectl update cluster as
described previously. To view the ConfigMap for troubleshooting:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG get configmap metallb-config --namespace kube-system
Benefits of using MetalLB
MetalLB runs directly on your cluster nodes, so it doesn't require extra VMs.
The MetalLB controller does IP address management for Services, so you don't
have to manually choose an IP address for each Service.
Active instances of MetalLB for different Services can run on different nodes.
You can
share an IP address
among different Services.
MetalLB compared to F5 BIG-IP and Seesaw
VIPs must be in the same subnet as the cluster nodes. This is also
a requirement for Seesaw, but not for F5 BIG-IP.
There are no metrics for traffic.
There is no hitless failover; existing connections are reset during failover.
External traffic to the Pods of a particular Service passes through a single
node running the MetalLB speaker. This means that the client IP address is
usually not visible to containers running in the Pod.
Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) with
Dataplane IP Learning is incompatible with Seesaw and MetalLB load balancers. We recommend that
you use manual load balancing , or disable
Dataplane IP Learning when using Seesaw or MetalLB as your load balancer. Additionally, Seesaw is
in maintenance mode. As of Google Distributed Cloud version 1.32, upgrades are blocked for clusters using
Seesaw. You must migrate clusters to
recommended features before upgrading to 1.32.
