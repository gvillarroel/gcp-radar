Manage clusters from the Google Cloud console
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document explains how to make clusters created with Google Distributed Cloud
software for VMware available for management in the Google Cloud console.
This includes basic management such as being able to log in to clusters and view
their workloads, as well as how to enable cluster lifecycle management so that
you can upgrade, update, and delete clusters.
Fleet members and the console
All Google Distributed Cloud clusters must be members of a
fleet —a unified way to view
and manage multiple clusters and their workloads. Each fleet of clusters
is associated with a
fleet host project .
In Google Distributed Cloud, an admin cluster is registered to a fleet at creation
time by specifying your fleet host project in the gkeConnect section of the
cluster configuration file. Google Distributed Cloud uses that information to
register your cluster to the specified fleet project. If the registration
failed, you can re-attempt the registration by running gkectl update credentials register .
Note that when re-attempting the registration, you don't need to update the
connect-register service account key .
In other words, you can continue using your original connect-register service
account. For more information about the command, see Rotatiing service account keys .
In Google Distributed Cloud, a user cluster is registered to a fleet at creation
time:
When you create a user cluster using gkectl , you specify your fleet host project
in the gkeConnect section of the cluster configuration file.
Google Distributed Cloud uses that information to register your cluster to the
specified fleet project.
When you create a user cluster by using a standard tool (the
console, the Google Cloud CLI or Terraform) the cluster
automatically becomes a fleet member in the project that you specify.
Fleet members outside of Google Cloud like Google Distributed Cloud are displayed
in the console in your fleet host project, along with other
fleet clusters such as GKE on Google Cloud. The extent to
which you can manage Google Distributed Cloud from the console
depends on the following:
If you have set up authentication , you can
log in to your clusters and view their workloads and other details.
If you have
enabled cluster lifecycle management
for the cluster, you can also upgrade, update, or delete user clusters by
using the console. If this feature isn't enabled, you can only
manage cluster lifecycle using gkectl on your admin workstation.
View registered clusters
All your fleet clusters are displayed on the
Google Kubernetes Engine clusters overview
page in the console. This both gives you an overview of your
entire fleet and, for Google Distributed Cloud, lets you see which clusters are
managed by the GKE On-Prem API.
To view your fleet clusters:
In the console, go to the Google Kubernetes Engine clusters overview
page.
Go to GKE clusters
Select the Google Cloud project.
If vm Google Distributed Cloud is displayed in the Type
column, the cluster is managed by the GKE On-Prem API.
If External is displayed in the Type column, the cluster isn't
managed by the GKE On-Prem API.
To see more details about a cluster, users need to log in and authenticate to
the cluster. To do this, you need to:
Set up an authentication method
Grant users specific Identity and Access Management roles
Set up authentication
As described previously, all fleet clusters appear in the GKE clusters
lists in the console. However, to see more details such as nodes
and workloads (and to perform cluster lifecycle management tasks if the feature
is enabled), users need to log in and authenticate to the cluster. To do this,
your registered clusters must be set up with one of the following authentication
methods:
Google identity : This option lets users log in using their
Google Cloud identity, which is the email address associated with your
Google Cloud account. Use this option if users already have access to
Google Cloud with their Google identity. If you created the cluster in
the console, you can log in to the cluster using your Google
identity, but you will need to configure authentication for other users.
Login with Google identity is the simplest approach to authentication in the
console, particularly if you are trying out
Google Distributed Cloud with a minimal installation, and so we have described
how to set this up in more detail below in
Set up Google identity authentication .
OpenID Connect (OIDC) : This option lets users log in to clusters from the
console using their identity from a third-party OIDC identity
provider such as Okta or Microsoft AD FS. You might want to use this option if
your users have existing usernames, passwords, and security group memberships
from your provider. You can find out how to set up third-party OIDC
authentication for your clusters in the following guides:
Configure clusters for GKE Identity Service with OIDC :
This guide shows you how to set up OIDC authentication on a cluster by
cluster basis.
Set up GKE Identity Service for a fleet :
This option lets you set up OIDC at the fleet level.
Bearer token : If the preceding Google-provided solutions aren't suitable for
your organization, you can set up authentication using a Kubernetes service
account and using its bearer token to log in. For details,
see Set up using a bearer token .
Grant required roles
Access to the console is controlled by
Identity and Access Management (IAM). These IAM roles are required no
matter which authentication method you choose. To manage the cluster lifecycle
in the console you need to grant some IAM roles.
To let users access the console, at a minimum, you need to
grant the following roles:
roles/container.viewer . This role lets users view the GKE
Clusters page and other container resources in the console.
For details about the permissions included in this role, or to grant a
role with read/write permissions, see
Kubernetes Engine roles
in the IAM documentation.
roles/gkehub.viewer . This role lets users view clusters outside
Google Cloud in the console. For details about the
permissions included in this role, or to grant a role with read/write
permissions, see
GKE Hub roles in the
IAM documentation.
To let users manage the cluster lifecycle in the console,
grant the roles/gkeonprem.admin IAM role. The
roles/gkeonprem.admin role gives users administrative access to the
GKE On-Prem API, which the console uses to manage the
cluster lifecycle. For details on the permissions included in this role, see
GKE on-prem roles
in the IAM documentation.
The following commands shows how to grant the minimal roles needed to manage
cluster lifecycle in the console:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--member= MEMBER \
--role=roles/container.viewer
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--member= MEMBER \
--role=roles/gkehub.viewer
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--member= MEMBER \
--role=roles/gkeonprem.admin
where:
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID is the fleet host project. For clusters
created using gkectl , this is the project that you configured in the
gkeConnect section of the user cluster's configuration file. For
clusters created in the console, this is the project
that you chose when the cluster was created.
MEMBER is the user's email address in the format
user:emailID , for example: user:alice@example.com
Enable cluster lifecycle management in the console
User clusters created by using standard tools (the console, the
gcloud CLI, or Terraform) are automatically enrolled in
the GKE On-Prem API, and let you perform cluster lifecycle management tasks
in the console. If you want to enable this feature for user
clusters created using gkectl , follow the steps in
Configure a user cluster to be managed by the GKE On-Prem API .
When cluster lifecycle management is enabled, you can do the following tasks
from the console:
Upgrade user clusters
Resize user clusters
Create and manage node pools
Delete user clusters
Note: If you prefer not to manage cluster lifecycle from Google Cloud, the
same tasks can all be performed by using the admin workstation and gkectl .
Set up Google identity authentication
To let users log in to the cluster using their Google identity, you need to
configure the following:
Users need specific Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles
to be able to see and interact with clusters in the console on
the
GKE Clusters list .
Users need to be added to the Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC)
policies that the Connect gateway
needs to access the cluster's Kubernetes API server via the
Connect agent .
Configure RBAC authorization
Each cluster's Kubernetes API server needs to be able to authorize requests that
come from the console. To configure authorization, you need to
configure Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies on each cluster.
If you used a standard tool to create the user cluster, you might already
be granted the appropriate RBAC policies that grant you full administrative
access to the cluster. The GKE On-Prem API adds your Google Account
automatically as an administrator in the following cases:
You created the user cluster in the console.
You created the user cluster using the gcloud CLI, and your
Google Account was specified in the --admin-users flag in the cluster
create command.
You created the user cluster using Terraform and you Google Account was
specified in the authorization.admin_users.username field.
User clusters created using gkectl don't grant you the RBAC policies to
administer the cluster using the console. You need to add yourself
after the cluster is created. No matter which tool that you used to create the
cluster, you can add others as administrators after the cluster is created.
You can use any of the following ways to grant administrative access to the
cluster. Two different gcloud commands are provided.
The gcloud ... generate-gateway-rbac command needs to be run on your admin
workstation because the command requires access to the cluster's kubeconfig
and context (which are typically only on your admin workstation). The
generate-gateway-rbac command lets you customize the RBAC
policies, but the user email addresses won't be displayed as administrators in
the Cluster Details section in the console.
The gcloud ... update command can be run on either your admin workstation
or any computer that has access to the GKE On-Prem API.
generate-gateway-rbac
Connect to your admin workstation.
Run the following command to update components:
gcloud components update
Generate and apply the RBAC policies to your cluster for users and service
accounts:
gcloud container fleet memberships generate-gateway-rbac \
--membership = MEMBERSHIP_NAME \
--role = ROLE \
--users = USERS \
--project = FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--kubeconfig = KUBECONFIG_PATH \
--context = KUBECONFIG_CONTEXT \
--apply
Replace the following:
MEMBERSHIP_NAME : the name used to uniquely represent the
cluster in its fleet. In Google Distributed Cloud, the membership name and
the cluster name are the same.
ROLE : the Kubernetes role you want to grant to the users on the
cluster. To grant users full access to every resource in the cluster in
all namespaces, specify clusterrole/cluster-admin . To provide
read-only access, specify clusterrole/view . You can also, create a
custom role, for example: role/mynamespace/namespace-reader .
The custom role must already exist before you run the command.
USERS : the email addresses of the users (user accounts or
service accounts) to whom you want to grant the permissions, as a
comma-separated list. For example:
--users=foo@example.com,test-acct@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : the project ID of the fleet host project.
KUBECONFIG_PATH : the local path where your kubeconfig
containing an entry for the cluster is stored.
KUBECONFIG_CONTEXT : the context of the cluster as it appears in
the kubeconfig file. You can get the current context from the command line
by running kubectl config current-context . Whether you use the current
context or not, make sure that it works for accessing the cluster by
running a simple command such as:
kubectl get namespaces \
--kubeconfig= KUBECONFIG_PATH \
--context= KUBECONFIG_CONTEXT
After running gcloud container fleet memberships generate-gateway-rbac ,
you see something like the following at the end of the output, which is
truncated for readability:
Validating input arguments.
Specified Cluster Role is: clusterrole/cluster-admin
Generated RBAC policy is:
--------------------------------------------
...
Applying the generate RBAC policy to cluster with kubeconfig: /usr/local/google/home/foo/.kube/config, context: kind-kind
Writing RBAC policy for user: foo@example.com to cluster.
Successfully applied the RBAC policy to cluster.
This is the context for accessing the cluster through the
Connect gateway .
For more details on the generate-gateway-rbac command, see the
gcloud CLI reference guide .
update
Run the following command to update components:
gcloud components update
For each user that needs to be granted the clusterrole/cluster-admin
role, include the --admin-users flag and run the following command.
You can't specify multiple users in a single flag. Be sure to include your
Google Account in the command because the command overwrites the grant
list with the users that you specify in the command.
gcloud container vmware clusters update USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
--admin-users YOUR_GOOGLE_ACCOUNT \
--admin-users ADMIN_GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_1 \
In addition to granting the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin role, the
command grants the RBAC policies the users need to access the cluster
through the Connect gateway .
Console
To apply the RBAC policies to users, do the following steps in the
console:
In the console, go to the Google Kubernetes Engine clusters overview
page.
Go to GKE clusters
Select the Google Cloud project that the user cluster is in.
In the cluster list, click the name of the cluster to display its details.
In the Authorization section, click the Admin users edit button.
Enter the email address of the user you want to add as a cluster admin in the Edit authorization panel. To add additional admin users, click Add admin user .
When you are finished adding users, click Save changes .
Note: When you add admin users, the GKE On-Prem API applies the Kubernetes
RBAC policies to the cluster to grant the users the same administrative access
that you were granted when you created the cluster. These policies grant users
the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin role, which provides full access to
every resource in the cluster in all namespaces.
