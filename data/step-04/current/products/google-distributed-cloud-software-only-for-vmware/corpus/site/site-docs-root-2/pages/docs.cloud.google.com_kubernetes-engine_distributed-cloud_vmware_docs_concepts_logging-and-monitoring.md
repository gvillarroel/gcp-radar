Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware includes multiple options for
cluster logging and monitoring, including cloud-based managed services, open
source tools, and validated compatibility with third-party commercial solutions.
This document explains these options and provides some basic guidance on
selecting the proper solution for your environment.
Options for Google Distributed Cloud
You have several logging and monitoring options for your Google Distributed Cloud:
Cloud Logging
and
Cloud Monitoring
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus ( Preview )
Validated configurations with third-party solutions.
Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring
Google Cloud Observability (formerly Stackdriver) is the built-in observability solution for
Google Cloud. It offers a fully managed logging solution, metrics
collection, monitoring, dashboarding, and alerting. Cloud Monitoring monitors
Google Distributed Cloud clusters in a similar way as cloud-based
GKE clusters.
You can configure the in-cluster agents for the scope of monitoring and logging,
as well as the level of metrics collected:
Scope of logging and monitoring can be set to system components only (the
default) or for system components and applications
Level of metrics collected can be configured for an optimized set of metrics
or for full metrics
See
Configuring logging and monitoring agents for Google Distributed Cloud
on this document for more information.
Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring provide an ideal solution
for customers wanting a single, easy-to-configure, powerful cloud-based
observability solution. We highly recommend Logging and
Monitoring when running workloads only on
Google Distributed Cloud, or workloads on GKE and
Google Distributed Cloud. For applications with components running on
Google Distributed Cloud and traditional on-premises infrastructure, you might
consider other solutions for an end-to-end view of those applications.
For details about architecture, configuration, and
what data is replicated to your Google Cloud project by default for
Google Distributed Cloud, see the section
How logging and monitoring for Google Distributed Cloud works .
For more information about Cloud Logging, see the
Cloud Logging documentation.
For more information about Cloud Monitoring, see the
Cloud Monitoring documentation.
Third-party solutions
Google has worked with several third-party logging and monitoring solution
providers to help their products work well with Google Distributed Cloud.
These include Datadog, Elastic, and Splunk. Additional validated third parties
will be added in the future.
For more information about using third-party solutions with
Google Distributed Cloud, see the following:

How logging and monitoring for Google Distributed Cloud works
Logging and monitoring agents are installed and activated in each
cluster when you create a new admin or user cluster. The agents collect data about system components—the scope of which you can configure.
To view the collected data on the Google Cloud console, you must configure the Google Cloud project that stores the logs and metrics you want to view.
The logging and monitoring agents on each cluster include:
GKE metrics agent ( gke-metrics-agent ). A DaemonSet that sends metrics to the Cloud Monitoring API.
Log forwarder ( stackdriver-log-forwarder ). A Fluent Bit DaemonSet that forwards logs
from each machine to Cloud Logging. The log forwarder buffers the log
entries on the node locally and resends them for up to four hours. If the
buffer gets full or if the log forwarder can't reach the Cloud Logging API
for more than four hours, then logs are dropped.
Global GKE metrics agent ( gke-metrics-agent-global ). A
Deployment that sends metrics to the Cloud Monitoring API.
Metadata agent ( stackdriver-metadata-agent ). A
Deployment that sends metadata for Kubernetes resources such as pods,
deployments, or nodes to the Stackdriver Resource Metadata API; this
data is used to enrich metric queries by enabling you to query by
deployment name, node name, or even Kubernetes service name.
kube-state-metrics A Deployment that listens to API server
and generate metrics about the states of objects.
node-exporter A DaemonSet that generates hardware and OS metrics.
You can see all the Deployment agents by running the following
command:
kubectl --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get deployments -l "managed-by=stackdriver" --all-namespaces
where CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG is the path to your kubeconfig file for the cluster.
The output of this command is similar to the following:
gke-metrics-agent-global 1/1 Running 0 4h31m
stackdriver-metadata-agent-cluster-level 1/1 Running 0 4h31m
You can see all the DaemonSet agents by running the following
command:
kubectl --kubeconfig CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get daemonsets -l "managed-by=stackdriver" --all-namespaces
The output of this command is similar to the following:
gke-metrics-agent 1/1 Running 0 4h31m
stackdriver-log-forwarder 1/1 Running 0 4h31m
Configuring logging and monitoring agents for Google Distributed Cloud
The agents installed with Google Distributed Cloud collect data
about system components, subject to your settings and configuration, for the
purposes of maintaining and troubleshooting issues with your clusters.
System components only (default scope)
Upon installation, agents collect logs and metrics, including
performance details (for example, CPU and memory utilization) and similar
metadata, for Google-provided system components. These include all workloads in
the admin cluster, and for user clusters, workloads in the kube-system,
gke-system, gke-connect, istio-system, and config-management-system namespaces.
You can configure or disable the agents as described in the
following sections.
The scope of logs and metrics collected can be expanded to include applications as well. For instructions to enable application logging and monitoring, see
Enabling Logging and Monitoring for user applications .
Optimized metrics (default metrics)
By default, the metrics agents running in the cluster collect and report an
optimized set of container, kubelet and kube-state-metrics metrics to Google Cloud Observability (formerly Stackdriver).
Fewer resources are needed to collect this
optimized set of metrics, which improves overall performance and scalability. This is especially important for container-level and kube-level metrics, due to the large
quantity of objects to monitor.
Excluded container metrics
The following container metrics are excluded from the optimized metrics:
container_cpu_cfs_periods_total

The complete set of Google Distributed Cloud metrics is documented in
Google Distributed Cloud metrics .
To disable optimized kube-state-metrics metrics (not recommended), set the optimizedMetrics field
to false in your Stackdriver custom resource. For more information on changing
your Stackdriver custom resource, see
Configuring Stackdriver component resources .
All Google Distributed Cloud metrics, including those excluded by default, are
described in Google Distributed Cloud metrics .
Enable and disable Stackdriver
You can enable or disable logging and monitoring agents completely by enabling or disabling the Stackdriver custom
resource . This feature is in Preview.
Before you disable the logging and monitoring agents, see the support
page for details about how
this affects Google Cloud Support's SLAs.
Logging and monitoring agents capture data stored locally, subject to your storage and
retention configuration. The data is replicated to the Google Cloud
project specified at installation by using a service account that is authorized to
write data to that project. You can disable these agents at any time, as
described earlier.
You can also manage and delete data that the logging and monitoring agents have sent to Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring. For more information, see
Cloud Monitoring documentation .
Configuration requirements for logging and monitoring
To view Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring data, you
must configure the Google Cloud project that stores the logs and
metrics you want to view. This Google Cloud project is called your
logging-monitoring project .
Enable the following APIs in your logging-monitoring project:
Stackdriver API
Cloud Monitoring API
Cloud Logging API
Config Monitoring for Ops API
Grant the following IAM roles to your
logging-monitoring service account
on your logging-monitoring project.
logging.logWriter
monitoring.metricWriter
stackdriver.resourceMetadata.writer
monitoring.dashboardEditor
opsconfigmonitoring.resourceMetadata.writer
Log tags
Many Google Distributed Cloud logs have a tag of F :
logtag: "F"
This tag means that the log entry is complete or full . To learn more about
this tag, see
Log format
in the Kubernetes design proposals on GitHub.
