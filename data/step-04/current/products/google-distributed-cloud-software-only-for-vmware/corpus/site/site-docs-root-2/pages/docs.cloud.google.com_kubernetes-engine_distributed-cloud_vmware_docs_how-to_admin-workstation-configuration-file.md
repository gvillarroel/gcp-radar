This page describes the fields in the admin workstation configuration
file for Google Distributed Cloud.
Generating a template for your configuration file
Download the gkeadm command-line tool.
To generate a template:
./gkeadm create config --config= OUTPUT_FILENAME
Replace OUTPUT_FILENAME with a path of your choice for the generated
template. If you omit this flag, gkeadm names the file admin-ws-config.yaml
and puts it in the current directory.

Filling in your configuration file
In your configuration file, enter field values as described in the following
sections.
gcp
This section holds information about your component access service account.
gcp.componentAccessServiceAccountKeyPath
String. The path of the JSON key file for your component access service account.
For information on creating a JSON key file, see
component access service account .
For example:
gcp:
componentAccessServiceAccountKeyPath: "my-key-folder/component-access-key.json"
vCenter
This section holds information about your vSphere environment.
vCenter.credentials.address
String. The IP address or the hostname of your vCenter server.
Before you fill in the address field, download and inspect
the serving certificate of your vCenter server. Enter the following command to
download the certificate and save it to a file named vcenter.pem .
true | openssl s_client -connect VCENTER_IP :443 -showcerts 2>/dev/null | sed -ne '/-BEGIN/,/-END/p' > vcenter.pem
Replace VCENTER_IP with the IP address of your vCenter Server.
Open the certificate file to see the Subject Common Name and the Subject
Alternative Name:
openssl x509 -in vcenter.pem -text -noout
The output shows the Subject Common Name (CN). This might be an IP address, or
it might be a hostname. For example:
Subject: ... CN = 203.0.113.100
Subject: ... CN = my-host.my-domain.example
The output might also include one or more DNS names under
Subject Alternative Name :
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
DNS:vcenter.my-domain.example
Choose the Subject Common Name or one of the DNS names under
Subject Alternative Name to use as the value of vcenter.credentials.address
in your configuration file. For example:
vCenter:
credentials:
address: "203.0.113.1"
...
vCenter:
credentials:
address: "my-host.my-domain.example"
...
vCenter.credentials.fileRef.path
String. The path of a
credentials configuration file
that holds the username and password of your vCenter user account. The user
account should have the Administrator role or equivalent privileges. See
vSphere requirements .
When you run gkeadm create config , it creates a template for an admin
workstation configuration file named admin-ws-config.yaml . It also creates a
template for a credentials configuration file named credential.yaml .
Example:
vCenter:
credentials:
fileRef:
path: "credential.yaml"
vCenter.credentials.fileRef.entry
String. The name of the credentials block, in your
credentials configuration file ,
that holds the username and password of your vCenter user account.
In credential.yaml , gkeadm automatically creates a credentials block named
vCenter .
Example:
vCenter:
credentials:
fileRef:
entry: "vCenter"
vCenter.datacenter
String. The name of your vCenter datacenter. For example:
vCenter:
datacenter: "MY-DATACENTER"
vCenter.datastore
String. The name of your vCenter datastore. For example:
vCenter:
datastore: "MY-DATASTORE"
vCenter.cluster
String. The name of your vCenter cluster. For example:
vCenter:
cluster: "MY-CLUSTER"
vCenter.network
String. The name of the vCenter network where you want to create your admin
workstation. For example:
vCenter:
network: "MY-VM-NETWORK"
vCenter.folder
String. The folder in your datacenter where your cluster VMs will be located.
For example:
vCenter:
folder: "MY-FOLDER"
vCenter.resourcePool
String. If you are using a non-default resource pool, provide the name of your
vCenter resource pool. For example:
vCenter:
resourcePool: "MY-POOL"
If you are using the default resource pool, provide the following value:
vCenter:
resourcePool: " MY_CLUSTER /Resources"
Replace MY_CLUSTER with the name of your vCenter cluster.
See Specifying the root resource pool for a standalone host .
vCenter.caCertPath
String. When a client, like Google Distributed Cloud, sends a request to your
vCenter server, the server must prove its identity to the client by presenting
a certificate or a certificate bundle. To verify the certificate or bundle,
Google Distributed Cloud must have the root certificate in the chain of trust.
Set vCenter.caCertPath to the path of the root certificate. For example:
vCenter:
caCertPath: "/usr/local/google/home/me/certs/vcenter-ca-cert.pem"
Your VMware installation has a certificate authority (CA) that issues a
certificate to your vCenter server. The root certificate in the chain of trust
is a self-signed certificate created by VMware.
If you do not want to use the VMWare CA, which is the default, you can configure
VMware to
use a different certificate authority .
If your vCenter server uses a certificate issued by the default VMware CA,
download the certificate as follows:
curl -k "https:// SERVER_ADDRESS /certs/download.zip" > download.zip
Replace SERVER_ADDRESS with the address of your vCenter server.
Install the unzip command and unzip the certificate file:
sudo apt-get install unzip
unzip download.zip
If the unzip command doesn't work the first time, enter the command again.
Find the certificate file in certs/lin .
proxyUrl
String: If the machine you are using to run gkeadm uses a proxy server for
access to the internet, set this field to the URL of the proxy server. Include
the port number even if it's the same as the scheme's default port. For example:
proxyUrl: "https://my-proxy.example.local:80"
adminWorkstation
This section holds information about your admin workstation.
adminWorkstation.name
String. A name for your admin workstation. This field is populated with a
generated value. You can keep the generated value or provide a different name
of your choice. For example:
adminWorkstation
name: "gke-admin-ws-200617-113711"
adminWorkstation.cpus
Integer. The number of virtual CPUs for your admin workstation. For example:
adminWorkstation:
cpus: 4

Integer. The number of megabytes of memory for your admin workstation. For
example:
adminworkstation:
memoryMB: 8192
adminWorkstation.diskGB
Integer. The size, in gigabytes, of the boot disk for the admin workstation.
We recommend at least 100 GB, and in version 1.28 and later, 100 GB is
required. For example:
adminWorkstation:

adminWorkstation.dataDiskName
String. A name for the persistent disk to be mounted to the home directory.
This field is populated with a generated value. You can keep the generated
value or provide a name of your choice. Must end with .vmdk . Any directory
in the supplied path must be created before deployment. If no value is set
for this field, it defaults to:
gke-on-prem-admin-workstation-data-disk/ ADMIN_WORKSTATION_NAME -data-disk.vmdk
For example:
adminWorkstation:
dataDiskName: "gke-on-prem-admin-workstation-data-disk/gke-admin-ws-200617-113711-data-disk.vmdk"
adminWorkstation.dataDiskMB
Integer. The size in megabytes of the data disk. If no value is set for this
field, it defaults to 512 . For example:
adminWorkstation:
dataDiskMB: 512
adminWorkstation.network.ipAllocationMode
String. If you want your admin workstation to get its IP address from a DHCP
server, set this to "dhcp" . If you want your admin workstation to have a
static IP address of your choice, set this to "static" . For example:
adminWorkstation:
network:
ipAllocationMode: "static"
adminWorkstation.network.hostconfig
If you set ipAllocationMode to "static" , fill in the fields in this
section.
If you set ipAllocationMode to "dhcp" , remove this section or leave it
commented out.
adminWorkstation.network.hostConfig.ip
String. An IP address of your choice for your admin workstation. For example:
adminWorkstation:
network:
hostconfig:
ip: "172.16.5.1"
Note: If your system uses a Docker runtime, note that the default network of the docker daemon is 172.17.0.0/16. Make sure that the IP address you select for adminWorkstation.network.hostConfig.ip is not in that network.
adminWorkstation.network.hostConfig.gateway
String. The IP address of the default gateway for the network that contains
your admin workstation. For example:
adminWorkstation:
network:
hostconfig:
gateway: "172.16.6.254"

- "172.16.255.2"
adminWorkstation.proxyUrl
String. If your network is behind a proxy server, and you want both your admin
workstation and your admin cluster to use the same proxy
server, then set adminworkstation.proxyURL to the URL of the proxy server.
Include the port number even if it's the same as the scheme's default port. For
example:
adminworkstation:
proxyUrl: "http://aw-proxy.example:80"
adminWorkstation.ntpServer
String. The hostname or IP address of the Network Time Protocol server that
your admin workstation should use. For example:
adminWorkstation:
ntpServer: "216.239.35.0"
If you leave this empty, Google Distributed Cloud uses "ntp.ubuntu.com" .
