Configure a storage policy
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document shows how to configure a
VM storage policy
for a Google Distributed Cloud cluster.
Overview
In vSphere,
Storage Policy Based Management (SPBM)
helps to align storage with the application demands of virtual machines. It
provides a storage policy framework that serves as a single unified control
panel across a broad range of data services and storage solutions.
In Google Distributed Cloud, you can specify storage policies as an
alternative to specifying
datastores .
You define storage policies based on your application requirements and then
vSphere selects and manages datastores automatically. This can reduce the
overhead and maintenance associated with storage.
Inheritance
You can specify a storage policy for a user cluster, a node pool in a user
cluster, or a set of control-plane nodes in a user cluster. You can also
specify a storage policy for an admin cluster as long as the admin cluster
has a high-availability control plane and doesn't have any Windows node pools.
If you specify a storage policy for a user cluster, then the policy is inherited
by the node pools in the user cluster. If you specify a storage policy for an
individual node pool, that policy is used instead of the cluster-level storage
policy. Likewise if you specify a datastore for an individual node pool, that
datastore is used instead of the cluster-level storage policy.
In a user cluster that has Controlplane V2 enabled, the cluster-level storage
policy is inherited by the control-plane nodes. If you specify a storage policy
or datastore for the control-plane nodes, that storage policy or datastore is
used instead of the cluster-level storage policy.
Applying storage policies to datastores
You can apply a storage policy to a single datastore or to multiple datastores.
If you apply a storage policy to multiple datastores, then the storage resources
for an admin cluster, user cluster, or node pool can be spread out among the
datastores.
Example: Create a storage policy and a user cluster
This section gives an example creating a storage policy and a user cluster. This
example illustrates the idea that a storage policy can apply to two datastores.
Apply tags to datastores
To do the steps in this example, your vSphere environment must have at least two
datastores .
The
vSphere cluster
that will host the nodes for your user cluster must have access to the
datastores that you plan to use for this exercise. There is a preflight check
that verifies this.
The vCenter account that you use to apply tags must have the following
vSphere tagging privileges
privileges on the root vCenter Server:
vSphere Tagging.Create vSphere Tag
vSphere Tagging.Create vSphere Tag Category
vSphere Tagging.Assign or Unassign vSphere Tag
In the vSphere Client, assign the same tag to each of the datastores that you
have chosen to use for this exercise. For instructions, see
Assign Tags to Datastores .
For additional information, see
vSphere Tags and Attributes .
Create a storage policy
In the vSphere Client, create a VM storage policy for tag-based placement.
In the storage policy, specify the tag that you applied to your chosen
datastores. For instructions, see
Create a VM storage policy for Tag-Based Placement .
For additional information, see
VM storage policy .
If you are using a vSAN datastore, see
vSAN storage policy .
Create a user cluster
In this exercise, you create a user cluster that has a high-availability control
plane, so there are three control-plane nodes. In addition to the control-plane
nodes, there are six worker nodes, three in one node pool and three in a second
node pool. All nodes use static IP addresses.
Start by following the instructions in
Create a user cluster .
As you fill in your user cluster configuration file:
Set the value of vCenter.storagePolicyName to the name of an existing
storage policy. Don't set a value for vCenter.datastore .
Specify two node pools. For the first node pool, don't specify a datastore,
and don't specify a storage policy. For the second node pool, set the value
of vsphere.datastore to the name of an existing datastore.
Note: Don't specify both a datastore and a storage policy for vCenter ,
masterNode , or an individual node pool.
Example cluster configuration file
Here is an example of an IP block file and a portion of a user cluster
configuration file.
user-ipblock.yaml
blocks:
- netmask: 255.255.255.0
gateway: 172.16.21.1
ips:
- ip: 172.16.21.2
- ip: 172.16.21.3
- ip: 172.16.21.4
- ip: 172.16.21.5
- ip: 172.16.21.6
- ip: 172.16.21.7
- ip: 172.16.21.8

metalLB:

enableControlplaneV2: true
masterNode:
cpus: 4
memoryMB: 8192
replicas: 3
nodePools:
- name: "worker-pool-1"
enableLoadBalancer: true
- name: "worker-pool-2"
vSphere:
datastore: "my-np2-datastore"
...
These are the important points to understand in the preceding example:
The static IP addresses for the worker nodes are specified in an IP block
file. The IP block file has seven addresses even though there are only six
worker nodes. The extra IP address is needed during cluster upgrade, update,
and auto repair.
The static IP addresses for the three control-plane nodes are specified in the
network.controlPlaneIPBlock section of the user cluster configuration file.
There is no need for an extra IP address in this block.
The masterNode.replicas field is set to 3 , so there will be three
control-plane nodes. Under masterNode , nothing is specified for
vsphere.datastore or vsphere.storagePolicyName . So the control-plane nodes
will use the storage policy specified in vCenter.storagePolicyName .
The user cluster configuration file includes a value for
vCenter.storagePolicy , but it doesn't include a value for
vCenter.datastore . The specified storage policy will be used by nodes in any
pool that doesn't specify its own storage policy or its own datastore.
Under node-pool-1 , nothing is specified for vsphere.datastore or
vsphere.storagePolicyName . So the nodes in node-pool-1 will use the
storage policy specified in vCenter.storagePolicyName .
Under node-pool-2 , the value of vsphere.datastore is my-np2-datastore ,
so the nodes in node-pool-2 use that one datastore, and don't use
a storage policy.
Continue creating your user cluster as described in
Create a user cluster .
Create a user cluster in a separate data center from your admin cluster
A user cluster can be in a separate
data center
from the admin cluster. The two data centers can use the same instance of
vCenter Server
or different instances of vCenter Server.
This section gives an example of how to create a user cluster that uses a
separate instance of vCenter Server from the admin cluster. Because the user and
admin clusters use separate instances of vCenter Server, they are also in
separate data centers.
Start by following the instructions in
Create a user cluster .
As you fill in your user cluster configuration file:
Set the value of vCenter.storagePolicyName to the name of an existing
storage policy. Don't set a value for vCenter.datastore .
Under vCenter , specify values for address , datacenter , cluster , and
resourcePool .
Specify a value for network.vCenter.networkName .
Specify two node pools. For the first node pool, don't specify a datastore,
and don't specify a storage policy. For the second node pool, set the value
of vsphere.datastore to the name of an existing datastore.
Note: Don't specify both a datastore and a storage policy for vCenter ,
masterNode , or an individual node pool.

These are the important points to understand in the preceding example:
The user cluster configuration file includes a value for
vCenter.storagePolicy , but it doesn't include a value for
vCenter.datastore . The specified storage policy will be used by nodes in any
node pool that doesn't specify its own storage policy or its own datastore.
Under vCenter , there are values specified for address , datacenter ,
cluster , and resourcePool . So the user cluster will use a different
vCenter Server, data center, vSphere cluster, and resource pool from the admin
cluster.
There is a value specified for network.vCenter.networkName .
The masterNode.replicas field is set to 3 , so there will be three
control-plane nodes. Under masterNode , nothing is specified for
vsphere.datastore or vsphere.storagePolicyName . So the control-plane nodes
will use the storage policy specified in vCenter.storagePolicyName .
Under node-pool-1 , nothing is specified for vsphere.datastore or
vsphere.storagePolicyName . So the nodes in node-pool-1 will use the
storage policy specified in vCenter.storagePolicyName .
Under node-pool-2 , the value of vsphere.datastore is my-np2-datastore ,
so the nodes in node-pool-2 use that one datastore, and don't use
a storage policy.
