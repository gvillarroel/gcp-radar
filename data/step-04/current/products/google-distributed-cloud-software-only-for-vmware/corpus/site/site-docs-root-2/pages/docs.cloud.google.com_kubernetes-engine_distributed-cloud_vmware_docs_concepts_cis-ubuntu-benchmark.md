Configure AIDE cron job
AIDE is a file integrity checking tool that verifies compliance with CIS L1
Server benchmark 1.4 Filesystem Integrity Checking . In Google Distributed Cloud,
the AIDE process has been causing high resource usage issues.
The AIDE process on nodes is disabled by default to prevent resource
issues. This will affect compliance with CIS L1 Server benchmark 1.4.2: Ensure
filesystem integrity is regularly checked.
If you want to opt in to run the
AIDE cron job, complete the following steps to re-enable
AIDE:
Create a DaemonSet.
Here's a manifest for a DaemonSet:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
name: enable-aide-pool1
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: enable-aide-pool1
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: enable-aide-pool1
spec:
hostIPC: true
hostPID: true
nodeSelector:
cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool: pool-1
containers:
- name: update-audit-rule
image: ubuntu
command: ["chroot", "/host", "bash", "-c"]
args:
- |
set -x
while true; do
# change daily cronjob schedule
minute=30;hour=5
sed -E "s/([0-9]+ [0-9]+)(.*run-parts --report \/etc\/cron.daily.*)/$minute $hour\2/g" -i /etc/crontab
# enable aide
chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/aide
sleep 3600
done
volumeMounts:
- name: host
mountPath: /host
securityContext:
privileged: true
volumes:
- name: host
hostPath:
path: /
In the preceding manifest:
The AIDE cron job will only run on node pool pool-1 as specified by the
nodeSelector cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool: pool-1 . You can configure the
AIDE process to run on as many node pools as you want by specifying the
pools under the nodeSelector field. To run the same cron job schedule
across different node pools, remove the nodeSelector field. However, to
avoid host resource congestions, we recommend you maintain separate
schedules.
The cron job is scheduled to run daily at 5:30am as specified by the
configuration minute=30;hour=5 . You can configure different schedules for
the AIDE cron job as required.
Copy the manifest to a file named enable-aide.yaml , and create the
DaemonSet:
kubectl apply --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG -f enable-aide.yaml
where USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG is the path of the
kubeconfig file
for your user cluster.
Use Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) evaluation
We recommend that you scan your installation yourself to evaluate its Level 2
compliance with the Ubuntu Linux CIS
benchmark . There are a
variety of tools available for scanning your clusters and admin workstation. You
can use the following steps to install and run the OpenSCAP open-source
toolset to perform a Level 2 security assessment:
Copy the following script to a file called cis-benchmark.sh :
#!/bin/bash
set -x
REPORTS_DIR = " $1 "
mkdir -p " ${ REPORTS_DIR } "
echo "Start CIS L2 benchmark evaluation..."
apt update
apt install libopenscap8
sudo oscap xccdf eval \
--profile cis_level2_server_customized \
--tailoring-file /etc/cloud/usg/tailored-cis-level2-server-anthos-wmware.xml \
--results " ${ REPORTS_DIR } " /cis-results.xml \
--report " ${ REPORTS_DIR } " /cis-report.html \
--verbose INFO \
--verbose-log-file " ${ REPORTS_DIR } /cis-output-verbose.log" \
/etc/cloud/usg/ssg-ubuntu2204-ds-1.2.xml > " ${ REPORTS_DIR } " /cis-output.log 2>&1
chmod -R 755 " ${ REPORTS_DIR } /.."
echo "Done CIS L2 benchmark evaluation"
Make the script executable:
chmod +x cis-benchmark.sh
Run the script:
./cis-benchmark.sh REPORTS_DIR
Replace REPORTS_DIR with the path of an existing
directory where you want to save the generated evaluation report.
When the script completes successfully, the REPORTS_DIR
directory contains the generated cis-report.html file.
