CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document introduces the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, explains how to audit
your compliance with the benchmark, and explains what Google Distributed Cloud
configures when you cannot implement a recommendation yourself.
About the CIS Benchmarks
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) releases benchmarks for best practice
security recommendations. The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark provides a
set of recommendations for configuring Kubernetes to support a strong security
posture. The Benchmark is tied to a specific Kubernetes release. The
CIS Kubernetes Benchmark is written for the open source Kubernetes
distribution and intended to be as universally applicable across distributions
as possible.
Access the benchmark
The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark is available on the
CIS website .
Recommendation levels
The following table describes the recommendation levels in the
CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
Level
Description
Level 1
Recommendations intend to:
be practical and prudent;
provide a clear security benefit; and
not inhibit the utility of the technology beyond acceptable means.
Level 2
Extends the Level 1 profile.
Recommendations exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:
are intended for environments or use cases where security is paramount;
acts as defense in depth measure; or
may negatively inhibit the utility or performance of the technology.
Assessment status
An assessment status is included for every recommendation. The assessment status
indicates whether the given recommendation can be automated or requires manual
steps to implement. Both statuses are equally important and are determined and
supported as defined in the following tables:

1.2.11
Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysPullImages is set (Manual)
L1
Warn
not set
The AlwaysPullImages admission controller provides some protection for private registry images in noncooperative multitenant clusters, at the cost of making container registries a single-point-of-failure for creating new Pods across the entire cluster. GDC (software only) for bare metal does not enable the AlwaysPullImages admission controller, which leaves it up to cluster admins to implement admission policy to make this tradeoff for themselves.

GDC (software only) for bare metal manages kubelet server TLS using the --rotate-server-certificates flag.
4.2.13
Ensure that a limit is set on pod PIDs (Manual)
L1
Warn
not set
GDC (software only) for bare metal kubelet --pod-max-pids is not set by default, thus no explicit limit on the number of PIDs a pod can use. The pod inherits the host's overall PID limit, which is typically set by the operating system's pid_max kernel parameter. The operating system is user owned.

Warn
not set
GDC (software only) for bare metal kubelet --pod-max-pids is not set by default, thus no explicit limit on the number of PIDs a pod can use. The pod inherits the host's overall PID limit, which is typically set by the operating system's pid_max kernel parameter. The operating system is user owned.

not set
The AlwaysPullImages admission controller provides some protection for private registry images in noncooperative multitenant clusters, at the cost of making container registries a single-point-of-failure for creating new Pods across the entire cluster. GDC (software only) for bare metal does not enable the AlwaysPullImages admission controller, which leaves it up to cluster admins to implement admission policy to make this tradeoff for themselves.

Warn
not set
GDC (software only) for bare metal kubelet --pod-max-pids is not set by default, thus no explicit limit on the number of PIDs a pod can use. The pod inherits the host's overall PID limit, which is typically set by the operating system's pid_max kernel parameter. The operating system is user owned.

Audit benchmarks
Specific instructions for auditing each recommendation is available as part of
the relevant CIS Benchmark. However, you may wish to automate some of these
checks to simplify the verification of these controls in your environment.
The following tool can help with this.
Automated auditing of the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
You can use an open-source tool
kube-bench
to test your cluster configuration against the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
Make sure to specify the
appropriate version .
For example:
kube-bench --benchmark BENCHMARK_VERSION
Replace BENCHMARK_VERSION with the CIS Kubernetes
Benchmark version you're using to assess your cluster.
To run specific CIS Benchmark sections, such as master, node, or etcd, use the
run --targets command.
kube-bench run --targets master,node
For more information, see kube-bench documentation on running
kube-bench
and commands and
flags .
