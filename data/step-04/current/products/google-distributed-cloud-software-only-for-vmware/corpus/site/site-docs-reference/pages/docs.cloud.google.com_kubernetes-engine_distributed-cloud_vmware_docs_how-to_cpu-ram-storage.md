This document describes the CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for an
installation of Google Distributed Cloud (software only) on VMware. This page is for
Admins and architects who define IT solutions and system architecture in
accordance with company strategy. To learn more about common roles and example
tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
This document describes requirements for an installation where the user clusters
have
Controlplane V2
enabled.
The requirements given here are suitable for a production environment. For the
minimum CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for a proof-of-concept demonstration,
see Set up minimal infrastructure .
CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for an admin workstation
Before you create an admin workstation, you fill in an
admin workstation configuration file .
In the configuration file, you specify a vSphere
cluster ,
a vSphere
resource pool ,
and a vSphere
datastore .
The vSphere cluster is a set of physical hosts running
ESXi , and
the resource pool has a reservation for a portion of the resources available on
those ESXi hosts.
The resource pool must have enough CPU and RAM to support the requirements
of your admin workstation and any other VMs that belong to the pool. Likewise,
the datastore must have enough storage to support the requirements of your admin
workstation and any other VMs that use the datastore.
The admin workstation has the following requirements:
4 vCPUs (virtual CPUs)
8 GiB of RAM
100 GiB
Google Distributed Cloud supports only x86-64 vCPUs at the CPU microarchitecture
level v3 (x86-64-v3) and higher.

the datastore must have enough storage to support the requirements of your admin
cluster and any other VMs that use the datastore.
An admin cluster has one or three nodes. These are the control-plane nodes for
the admin cluster: three for a high-availability (HA) admin cluster and one for
a non-HA admin cluster.
The admin cluster has the following storage requirements:
If advanced clusters isn't enabled:
For each node, 40 GiB for a VM template
For each node, 25 GiB to store etcd object data
For each node, 240 GiB for
Google Cloud Observability to buffer logs and metrics
during a network outage
If advanced clusters is enabled
For each node, 50 GiB for a VM template
For each node, 25 GiB to store etcd object data
For each node, 20 GiB for
Google Cloud Observability to buffer logs and metrics
during a network outage
The following table gives the CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for nodes
in the admin cluster, the requirements depends on whether you will
enabled advanced clusters
when you create the admin cluster.
Node
Requirements
Purpose
Admin cluster control-plane
2 vCPUs

40 GiB of storage
Runs the control plane for the admin cluster.
Advanced admin cluster control-plane
3 vCPUs
7 GiB of RAM
50 GiB of storage
Runs the control plane for the admin cluster.
* Google Distributed Cloud supports only x86-64 vCPUs at the CPU
microarchitecture level v3 (x86-64-v3) and higher.
CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for a user cluster
Before you create a user cluster, you fill in a
user cluster configuration file .
In the configuration file, you specify a vSphere
cluster ,
a vSphere
resource pool
and a vSphere
datastore .
The vSphere cluster is a set of physical hosts running
ESXi , and
the resource pool has a reservation for a portion of the resources available on
those ESXi hosts.
The resource pool must have enough CPU and RAM to support the requirements
of your user cluster and any other VMs that belong to the pool. Likewise,
the datastore must have enough storage to support the requirements of your user
cluster and any other VMs that use the datastore.
A user cluster has the following storage requirements:
If advanced clusters isn't enabled:
For each control-plane node, 60 GiB
For each worker node, 40 GiB
For each node, 120 GiB for
Google Cloud Observability to buffer logs and metrics
during a network outage
If advanced clusters is enabled
For each control-plane node, 50 GiB
For each worker node, 40 GiB
For each node, 20 GiB for
Google Cloud Observability to buffer logs and metrics
during a network outage
The following table gives the required CPU, RAM, and storage for each
control-plane node in a user cluster, the requirements depends on whether you will
enabled advanced clusters
when you create the admin cluster. It also gives the default CPU, RAM, and
storage values for each worker node in a user cluster. Depending on the needs of
your workloads, you might want to adjust the values for your worker nodes. To
determine how much CPU and RAM are available on a node for your workloads, see
Resources available for your workloads .
You can specify values for CPU and RAM in the nodePools section of the
user cluster configuration file .
Node
Requirements
Purpose
Control-plane node
One or three VMs. Each VM has the following requirements:
3 vCPUs
5 GiB of RAM
60 GiB of storage
Runs the control plane for a user cluster.
Advanced control-plane node
Three VMs. Each VM has the following requirements:
3 vCPUs
5 GiB of RAM
50 GiB of storage
Runs the control plane for a user cluster, has advanced cluster enabled
Worker node
These are the default values for an individual worker node:
4 vCPUs
8 GiB of RAM
40 GiB of storage
A user cluster worker node is a virtual machine where your workloads run.
The resources required for your user cluster nodes depend on the workloads
you intend to run.
* Google Distributed Cloud supports only x86-64 vCPUs at the CPU
microarchitecture level v3 (x86-64-v3) and higher.
Example of CPU, RAM, and storage requirements when advanced clusters isn't enabled
Suppose you have two vSphere
data
centers :
Data center 1 has a
vSphere cluster
named Cluster 1, and Cluster 1 has a
resource pool
named Resource Pool 1. There are four physical hosts running ESXi in Cluster
1.
Data center 2 has a vSphere cluster named Cluster 2, and Cluster 2 has a
resource pool named Resource Pool 2. There are eight physical hosts running
ESXi in Cluster 2.
You decide that your admin workstation and your admin cluster will be in
Resource Pool 1 and use Datastore 1.
You decide that your user clusters will be in Resource Pool 2 and use
Datastore 2. You don't intend to enable Prometheus in your user
clusters.
You want to create these two user clusters:
A user cluster where you think each worker node will need 6 vCPUs,
16 GiB of RAM, and 40 GiB of storage. This user cluster will
have 20 worker nodes. You want an HA control plane for this user cluster,
so there will be three control-plane nodes in the user cluster.
A second user cluster where you think each worker node will need 4 vCPUs,
8 GiB of RAM, and 40 GiB of storage. This user cluster will have
eight worker nodes. You don't need an HA control plane for this user
cluster, so there will be only one control-plane node in the user cluster.
Requirements for Resource Pool 1 and Datastore 1
Resource Pool 1 has reserved a portion of the CPU and RAM provided by the
four ESXi hosts in Cluster 1. Resource Pool 1 must have enough CPU and RAM to
meet the requirements of the admin workstation and the admin cluster. And
Datastore 1 must have enough storage to meet the requirements of the admin
workstation and the admin cluster.
The admin cluster has three nodes, each of which is a control-plane node.
Recall that the admin workstation has these resource requirements:
Example: Admin workstation requirements
vCPU
4 vCPUs
RAM
8 GiB
Storage
50 GiB
The admin cluster has these resource requirements:
Example: Admin cluster requirements
vCPU
3 admin cluster control-plane node x 2 vCPUs/node
6 vCPUs
RAM
3 admin cluster control-plane node x 4 GiB/node
12 GiB
Storage
40 GiB for a VM template +
100 GiB for etcd object data +
240 GiB for Google Cloud Observability +
3 admin cluster control-plane nodes x 40 GiB/node
500 GiB
The following table gives the total CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for
the admin workstation and admin cluster. Resource Pool 1 and Datastore 1 must be
able to provide these resources:
Example: Total requirements for Resource Pool 1 and
Datastore 1
vCPU
29 vCPUs
RAM
73 GiB
Storage
790 GiB
Requirements for Resource Pool 2 and Datastore 2
Resource Pool 2 has reserved a portion of the CPU and RAM provided by the
eight ESXi hosts in Cluster 2. Resource Pool 2 must have enough CPU and RAM to
meet the requirements of both user clusters. And Datastore 2 must have enough
storage to meet the requirements of both user clusters.
The first user cluster has these resource requirements:
Example: First user cluster requirements
CPU
3 control-plane nodes x 3 vCPUs/node +
20 worker nodes x 6 vCPUs/node
129 vCPUs
RAM
3 control-plane nodes x 5 GiB/node +
20 worker nodes x 16 GiB/node
335 GiB
Storage
240 GiB for Google Cloud Observability +
3 control-plane nodes x 60 GiB/node +
20 worker nodes x 40 GiB/node
1,220 GiB
The second user cluster has these resource requirements:
Example: Second user cluster requirements
CPU
1 control-plane node x 3 vCPUs/node +
8 worker nodes x 4 vCPUs/node
35 vCPUs
RAM
1 control-plane node x 5 GiB/node +
8 worker nodes x 8 GiB/node
69 GiB
Storage
240 GiB for Google Cloud Observability +
1 control-plane node x 60 GiB/node +
8 worker nodes x 40 GiB/node
620 GiB
The following table gives the total CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for
the two user clusters. Resource Pool 2 and Datastore 2 must be able to provide
these resources:
Example: Total requirements for Resource Pool 2 and
Datastore 2
CPU
164 vCPUs
RAM
404 GiB
Storage
1,840 GiB
Resource overcommitment
vSphere supports resource overcommitment, for example
memory overcommitment
and
CPU overcommitment .
So the total resources reserved by the resource pools in a cluster can be
greater than the physical resources provided by the ESXi hosts in the cluster.
The requirements given in this document are for reserved virtual resources.
For a description of the physical resources required for a proof-of-concept
demonstration, see
Set up minimal infrastructure .
Monitor resource contention
You should monitor resource contention signals to make sure that your resource
pools and datastores can support your configured virtual resources. For more
information, see
Create a VM health status dashboard .
