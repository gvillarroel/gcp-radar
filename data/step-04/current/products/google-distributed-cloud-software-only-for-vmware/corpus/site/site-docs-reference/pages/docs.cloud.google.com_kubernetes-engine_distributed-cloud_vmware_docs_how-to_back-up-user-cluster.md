Back up and restore a user cluster
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document shows how to back up and restore the etcd store for a user cluster
created with Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware. This page also
provides a script that you can use to
automatically back up a cluster's etcd store.
You can create a backup file for recovery from unexpected disasters that might
damage your cluster's etcd data. Store the backup file in a location that is
outside of the cluster and isn't dependent on the cluster's operation.
Note: Using a third-party backup tool, such as Veeam, to back up a user
cluster isn't supported. Backing up the cluster with a third-party tool might
lead to unforeseen errors in cluster operations.
Limitations
This procedure does not back up application-specific data.
This procedure does not back up your PersistentVolumes.
Workloads scheduled after you create a backup aren't restored with that
backup.
You can't restore a cluster after a failed upgrade.
This procedure isn't intended to restore a deleted cluster.
Don't use this procedure for clusters with
advanced cluster enabled. Instead,
refer to
Back up and restore advanced clusters with gkectl .
Warning: Using a backup file to restore your etcd data is a last resort. We
don't recommend restoring from a backup file unless the cluster is completely
broken. Contact Google support for help in deciding the best course of action.
For more information about limitations, see
Infrastructure incompatibility .
Backing up a user cluster
A user cluster backup is a snapshot of the user cluster's etcd store.
The etcd store contains all of the Kubernetes objects and custom objects
required to manage cluster state. The snapshot contains the
data required to recreate the cluster's components and workloads.
The backup steps that you follow depend on whether Controlplane V2 is enabled
on the user cluster. When Controlplane V2 is enabled, the control plane for
the user cluster runs on the user cluster itself. When Controlplane V2 isn't
enabled, the control plane for the user cluster runs on one or more nodes in
the admin cluster, which is referred to as kubeception.
Run the following command to determine whether the cluster has Controlplane V2
enabled:
kubectl get onpremuserclusters --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
-n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.enableControlplaneV2}' && echo
If the output is true , follow the Controlplane V2 steps to back up
the cluster. Otherwise, follow the Kubeception steps.
Kubeception
Get a shell into the kube-etcd container:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG exec -it \
kube-etcd-0 -c kube-etcd -n USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
-- /bin/sh
where:
ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG is the admin cluster's kubeconfig
file.
USER_CLUSTER_NAME is the name of the user cluster.
In your shell, in the /tmp directory, create backup named snapshot.db :
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
--endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
--cacert=/etcd.local.config/certificates/etcdCA.crt \
--cert=/etcd.local.config/certificates/etcd.crt \
--key=/etcd.local.config/certificates/etcd.key \
snapshot save /tmp/snapshot.db
In your shell, enter exit to exit the shell.
Copy /tmp/snapshot.db from the kube-etcd container to the current directory:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG cp \
USER_CLUSTER_NAME /kube-etcd-0:/tmp/snapshot.db \
--container kube-etcd snapshot.db
Controlplane V2
Get the etcd Pod's name:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get pods \
-n kube-system -l component=etcd,tier=control-plane -ojsonpath='{$.items[*].metadata.name}{"\n"}'
where:
USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG is the user cluster's kubeconfig
file.
Example:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
etcd-uc1-cp1 1/1 Running 0 38m
etcd-uc1-cp2 1/1 Running 0 37m
etcd-uc1-cp3 1/1 Running 0 38m
Note that there can be multiple etcd pods, example, 3 for HA clusters. For backup, any etcd pod should work.
Get a shell into the etcd container:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG exec -it \
POD_NAME -c etcd -n kube-system -- /bin/sh
where:
POD_NAME is the name of the etcd pod taken from
the previous step.
In your shell, create a backup file named snapshot.db :
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
--endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
snapshot save /tmp/snapshot.db
In your shell, enter exit to exit the shell.
Copy snapshot.db from the etcd container to the workstation home directory:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
cp POD_NAME :/tmp/snapshot.db ~/snapshot.db \
-c etcd -n kube-system
Copy the secrets from the PKI directory:
ssh -i NODE_NAME .key ubuntu@ NODE_EXTERNAL_IP
sudo chmod -R 0644 /etc/kubernetes/pki/*
sudo chmod 0755 /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd
exit
scp -ri NODE_NAME .key ubuntu@ NODE_EXTERNAL_IP :/etc/kubernetes/pki ~/pki_ NODE_NAME
where:
NODE_NAME is the file containing ssh key for the control plane node
NODE_EXTERNAL_IP is the IP address of the user control plane node from
where you want the secrets to be copied from.
Note: For HA clusters, copy the secrets from all the user control plane nodes using the instructions
Restoring a user cluster from a backup (non-HA)
Before you use a backup file to restore your user cluster's etcd store,
diagnose your cluster
and resolve existing issues. Using a backup to restore a problematic cluster
might re-create or exacerbate issues. Contact the Google Cloud support team for
further assistance with restoring your clusters.
The following instructions explain how to use a backup file to restore a user
cluster in cases where the cluster's etcd data has become damaged and
the user cluster's etcd Pod is crashlooping.
Kubeception
You can restore the etcd data by deploying a utility Pod that overwrites the
damaged data with the backup. The admin cluster's API server must be running and
the admin cluster's scheduler must be able to schedule new Pods.
Find the name of the Secret used by etcd in the user cluster:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG -n USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
get secrets | grep kube-etcd-certs
Copy the following Pod manifest to a file named etcd-utility.yaml . Replace
the following:
NODE_NAME : the node where the kube-etcd-0 Pod is
running.
ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG : the admin cluster's
kubeconfig file.
USER_CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the user cluster.
GKE_ON_PREM_VERSION : the version of the cluster
where you want to perform the etcd restore (for example, 1.5.0-gke.0).
KUBE_ETCD_SECRET_NAME : the name of the Secret
used by etcd in the user cluster, starting with kube-etcd-certs .

Deploy the utility Pod:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
create -f etcd-utility.yaml --namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME
Copy snapshot.db from the current directory to the root directory of the
utility Pod:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG cp snapshot.db \
USER_CLUSTER_NAME /etcd-utility-0:snapshot.db --container etcd-utility
Get a shell into the etcd-utility container:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG exec it \
etcd-utility-0 --container etcd-utility --namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
-- bin/sh
In your shell, in the root directory, run the following command to create a
new folder that contains the backup:
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
--endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
--cacert=/etcd.local.config/certificates/etcdCA.crt \
--cert=/etcd.local.config/certificates/etcd.crt \
--key=/etcd.local.config/certificates/etcd.key \
snapshot restore snapshot.db
In your shell, delete the old etcd data:
rm -r var/lib/etcd/*
In your shell, copy the restored etcd data to its permanent location:
cp -r default.etcd/* var/lib/etcd/
In your shell, enter exit to exit the shell.
Delete the crashing etcd Pod:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
delete pod kube-etcd-0 --namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME
Verify that the etcd Pod is no longer crashing.
Delete the utility Pod:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
delete pod etcd-utility-0 --namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME
Remove etcd-utility.yaml from the current directory:
rm etcd-utility.yaml
Controlplane V2
You can restore the etcd data one at a time by deploying a temporary etcd container that overwrites the
damaged data with the backup.
Get a shell into the user control plane node:
ssh -i NODE_NAME .key ubuntu@ NODE_EXTERNAL_IP
In the shell, stop the Kubernetes API server and the etcd server:
sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml ~
In the shell, enter exit to exit the shell.
Run scp to copy the backup file snapshot.db & secrets to the user control plane node:
scp -i NODE_NAME .key ~/snapshot.db ubuntu@ NODE_EXTERNAL_IP :/tmp/
chmod a+rw pki/
scp -ri NODE_NAME .key ~/pki_ NODE_NAME ubuntu@ NODE_EXTERNAL_IP :/etc/kubernetes/pki
In the shell, use snapshot.db to restore the etcd data:
ETCDCTL_API=3 sudo etcdctl \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
--data-dir=/opt/data/var/lib/etcd \
--name= NODE_NAME \
--initial-advertise-peer-urls=https:// NODE_IP_ADDRESS :2380 \
--initial-cluster= NODE_NAME =https:// NODE_IP_ADDRESS :2380 \
snapshot restore /tmp/snapshot.db
Replace the following:
NODE_NAME : the name of the node where the restore
is being performed
NODE_IP_ADDRESS : the IP address of the said
node.
Add the flag - --initial-cluster-state=new in the etcd manifest file under container command.
Example:
containers:
- command:
- etcd
...
- --initial-cluster-state=new
...
In the shell, start the kube-apiserver and etcd servers:
sudo mv ~/etcd.yaml ~/kube-apiserver.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
In the shell, enter exit to exit the shell.
Note: If events-etcd pods are in CrashLoopBackOff state then add the flag - --initial-cluster-state=new and restart the pods. The events will be out-of-sync and you would lose events stored previously.
Restoring a user cluster from a backup (HA)
Kubeception
This section shows how to restore the etcd data for a high-availability (HA) user cluster.
For an HA user cluster, there are three nodes in the admin cluster that serve as
control planes for the user cluster. Each of those nodes runs an etcd Pod that
maintains etcd data on a storage volume.
If two of the etcd Pods are healthy, and the data on the associated storage
volumes is intact, then there is no need to use a backup file. That is because
you still have an etcd quorum.
In the rare case that two of the etcd storage volumes have corrupt data, you
need to use a backup file to restore the etcd data.
To perform the steps in this section, you must have already created a snapshot.db
file as described in Backing up a user cluster .
Listing your etcd Pods and nodes
List the etcd Pods that manage the etcd store for your user cluster. These
Pods run in the admin cluster:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get pods --namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
--output wide | grep kube-etcd
The output shows the etcd Pods and the nodes where the Pods run. The nodes
shown in the output are nodes in the admin cluster that serve as control planes
for your user cluster:
NAME ... NODE
kube-etcd-0 ... xxx
kube-etcd-1 ... yyy
kube-etcd-2 ... zzz
Make a note of the Pod names and the control plane node names for later.
Notice that each etcd Pod is named kube-etcd appended with a number.
This number is called the member number for the Pod. It identifies the
Pod as being a particular member of the etcd cluster that holds the object
data for your user cluster. This guide uses the placeholder
MEMBER_NUMBER to refer to the etcd Pod member number.
Also notice that each Pod in your etcd cluster runs on its own node.
Preparing to deploy the utility Pods
Save a manifest for the PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) for the user cluster's
Kubernetes API server. Then delete the PDB.
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG get pdb --namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
kube-apiserver-pdb --output yaml > kube-apiserver-pdb.yaml
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG delete pdb --namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
kube-apiserver-pdb
Stop the Kubernetes API server and the etcd maintenance Deployment. This ensures
that no components will use etcd during restoration:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG --namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
scale --replicas 0 statefulset kube-apiserver
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG --namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
scale --replicas 0 deployment gke-master-etcd-maintenance
Recall the name of the container image for your etcd Pods.
Deploying the utility Pods
Important: Perform the steps in this section for each of your etcd Pods.
Recall the name of the etcd Pod and the name of
the node where the Pod runs.
Save the following Pod manifest in the current directory in a file named
etcd-utility- MEMBER_NUMBER .yaml :
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: etcd-utility- MEMBER_NUMBER
namespace: USER_CLUSTER_NAME
spec:
containers:
- command: ["/bin/sh"]
args: ["-ec", "while :; do echo '.'; sleep 5 ; done"]
image: gcr.io/gke-on-prem-release/etcd-util: GKE_ON_PREM_VERSION
name: etcd-utility
volumeMounts:
- mountPath: /var/lib/etcd
name: data
- mountPath: /etcd.local.config/certificates
name: etcd-certs
nodeSelector:
kubernetes.googleapis.com/cluster-name: USER_CLUSTER_NAME
kubernetes.io/hostname: NODE_NAME
tolerations:
- effect: NoExecute
key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready
operator: Exists
tolerationSeconds: 300
- effect: NoExecute
key: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable
operator: Exists
tolerationSeconds: 300
- effect: NoSchedule
key: node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable

volumes:
- name: data
persistentVolumeClaim:
claimName: data-kube-etcd- MEMBER_NUMBER
- name: etcd-certs
secret:
defaultMode: 420
secretName: KUBE_ETCD_SECRET_NAME
The preceding manifest describes a utility Pod that you run temporarily to restore etcd data.
Create the utility Pod in your admin cluster:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG apply -f etcd-utility- MEMBER_NUMBER .yaml
Copy your backup file, snapshot.db , to the root directory of your
utility Pod:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG cp snapshot.db \
USER_CLUSTER_NAME /etcd-utility- MEMBER_NUMBER :snapshot.db
Get a shell into the etcd-utility container in the utility Pod:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG exec -it --namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
etcd-utility- MEMBER_NUMBER --container etcd-utility -- bin/sh
In your shell, in the root directory, use snapshot.db to restore the etcd
data:
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
--endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
--cacert=/etcd.local.config/certificates/etcdCA.crt \
--cert=/etcd.local.config/certificates/etcd.crt \
--key=/etcd.local.config/certificates/etcd.key \
--name=kube-etcd- MEMBER_NUMBER \
--initial-cluster=kube-etcd-0=https://kube-etcd-0.kube-etcd:2380,kube-etcd-1=https://kube-etcd-1.kube-etcd:2380,kube-etcd-2=https://kube-etcd-2.kube-etcd:2380 \
--initial-cluster-token=etcd-cluster-1 \
--initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://kube-etcd- MEMBER_NUMBER .kube-etcd:2380 \
snapshot restore snapshot.db
The preceding command stored etcd data in the
/kube-etcd- MEMBER_NUMBER .etcd directory.
In your shell, delete the old etcd data:
rm -r var/lib/etcd/*
In your shell, copy the restored etcd data to its permanent location:
cp -r kube-etcd- MEMBER_NUMBER .etcd/* var/lib/etcd/
In your shell, remove the temporary etcd directory and the backup file:
rm -R kube-etcd- MEMBER_NUMBER .etcd/
rm snapshot.db
In your shell, enter exit to exit the shell.
Delete the utility Pod:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG delete pod \
--namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME etcd-utility- MEMBER_NUMBER
Restarting components
Now that you have deployed and deleted your utility Pods, you need to restart
some cluster components.
Restart the Pods in the kube-etcd StatefulSet:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG rollout restart statefulset \
--namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME kube-etcd
Start the Kubernetes API servers for your user cluster:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG scale statefulset --replicas 3 \
--namespace USER_CLUSTER_NAME kube-apiserver
Start the etcd maintenance Deployment for your user cluster:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG scale deployment --replicas 1 \
--namespace= USER_CLUSTER_NAME gke-master-etcd-maintenance
Restore the PDB for the Kubernetes API server:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONIFG apply -f kube-apiserver-pdb.yaml
Controlplane V2
This section shows how to restore the etcd data for a high-availability (HA)
user cluster.
For a HA user cluster, there are three nodes in the user cluster that serves as
control plane for the user cluster. Each of those nodes runs an etcd Pod that
maintains etcd data on a storage volume.
If two of the etcd Pods are healthy, and the data on the associated storage
volumes is intact, then there is no need to use a backup file. That is because
you'd still have an etcd quorum.
In the rare case that two of the etcd storage volumes have corrupt data, you
need to use a backup file to restore the etcd data.
To do the steps in this section, you must have already created a snapshot.db
file as described in Backing up a user cluster .
Listing your etcd Pods and nodes
Important: Do the steps in the following sections for each of your user cluster CP nodes.
List the etcd Pods and their respective node:
kubectl get pod --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
-n kube-system -l component=etcd,tier=control-plane -o wide
The output shows the etcd Pods and the nodes where the Pods run. The nodes
shown in the output are nodes in the admin cluster that serve as control planes
for your user cluster:
NAME ... NODE
etcd-xxx ... xxx
etcd-yyy ... yyy
etcd-zzz ... zzz
Make a note of the Pod names and the control plane node names for later.
Notice that each etcd Pod is named etcd-xxx appended with a node name.
This is because in Controlplane V2 the etcd pods runs as a static pod.
Preparing to restore
Run scp to copy the backup file snapshot.db to all the user control plane nodes:
scp -i NODE_NAME .key ~/snapshot.db ubuntu@ NODE_EXTERNAL_IP :/tmp/
Copy the secrets to the respective user control plane node:
chmod a+rw ~/pki_*
scp -ri NODE_NAME .key ~/pki_ NODE_NAME /* ubuntu@ NODE_EXTERNAL_IP :/opt/data/etc/kubernetes/pki/
Get a shell into the user control plane node:
ssh -i NODE_NAME .key ubuntu@ NODE_EXTERNAL_IP
Performing the restore
Recall the name of the etcd Pod and the name of
the node where the Pod runs.
In the shell, stop the Kubernetes API server and the etcd server on all the user control plane nodes:
sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml ~
In the shell, use snapshot.db to restore the etcd data on all the user control plane nodes:
ETCDCTL_API=3 sudo etcdctl \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
--data-dir=/opt/data/var/lib/etcd \
--name= NODE_NAME \
--initial-advertise-peer-urls=https:// NODE_IP_ADDRESS :2380 \
--initial-cluster= NODE1 =https:// NODE1_IP :2380, NODE2 =https:// NODE2_IP :2380, NODE3 =https:// NODE3_IP :2380 \
snapshot restore /tmp/snapshot.db
Replace the following:
NODE_NAME : the name of the node where the restore
is being performed.
NODE_IP_ADDRESS : the IP address of the said node.
Fill the NODE1 , NODE2 , NODE3
and the NODE1_IP , NODE2_IP , NODE3_IP of their respective node for --initial-cluster flag. You can also get this from the etcd manifest.
Add the flag - --initial-cluster-state=existing in the etcd manifest file under container command.
Example:
containers:
- command:
- etcd
...
- --initial-cluster-state=existing
...
Restarting components
In the shell, start the kube-apiserver and etcd servers in all the user control plane nodes:
sudo mv ~/etcd.yaml ~/kube-apiserver.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
In the shell, enter exit to exit the shell.
Verify the kube-apiserver and etcd is running on all user control plane nodes:
kubectl get pod --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
-n kube-system -l tier=control-plane
Note: If events-etcd pods are in CrashLoopBackOff state then add the flag - --initial-cluster-state=new and restart the pods. The events will be out-of-sync and you would lose events stored previously.
Automatic cluster backup
You can use the script given here as an example on how to automatically back up your clusters. Note that the following script is not supported, and should only be used as reference to write a better, more robust and complete script. Before you run the script, fill in values for the five variables at the beginning of the script:
Kubeception
Set BACKUP_DIR to the path where you want to store the admin and user
cluster backups. This path shouldn't exist.
Set ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG to the path of the admin cluster's kubeconfig
file
Set USER_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE to the name of your user cluster. The name of
your user cluster is a namespace in the admin cluster.
Set EXTERNAL_IP to the VIP that you reserved for the admin control plane
service.
Set SSH_PRIVATE_KEY to the path of your
SSH key .
If you are using a private network, set JUMP_IP to your network's jump
server's IP address.
