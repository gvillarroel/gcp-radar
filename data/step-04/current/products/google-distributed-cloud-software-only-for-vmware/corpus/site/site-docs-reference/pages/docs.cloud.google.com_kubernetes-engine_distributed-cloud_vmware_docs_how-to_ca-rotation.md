Rotating user cluster certificate authorities
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Distributed Cloud uses certificates and private keys to
authenticate and encrypt connections between system components in user clusters.
The admin cluster creates a new set of certificate authorities (CAs) for each
user cluster, and uses CA certificates to issue additional leaf
certificates for system components. The admin cluster manages distribution of
the public CA certificates and leaf certificate key pairs to system components
to establish their secure communication.
The user cluster CA rotation feature lets you trigger a rotation of the
core system certificates in a user cluster. During a
rotation, the admin cluster replaces the core system CAs for the user cluster
with newly generated CAs, and distributes the new public CA certificates and
leaf certificate key pairs to user cluster system components. The rotation
happens incrementally, so that system components can continue to communicate
during the rotation. Note, however, that workloads and nodes are restarted
during the rotation.
There are three system CAs managed by the admin cluster for each user cluster:
The etcd CA secures communication from the API server to the etcd replicas and
also traffic between etcd replicas. This CA is self-signed.
The cluster CA secures communication between the API server and all internal
Kubernetes API clients (kubelets, controllers, schedulers).
This CA is self-signed.
The front-proxy CA secures communication with
aggregated APIs .
This CA is self-signed.
Also, you might be using an org CA to
sign the certificate configured by the authentication.sni option.
This CA and the SNI certificate are used to serve the Kubernetes API to clients
outside the cluster. You manage this CA and manually generate the SNI
certificate. Neither this CA nor the SNI certificate is affected by the user
cluster CA rotation feature.
Limitations
Warning: A CA rotation revokes the old CAs at the end of the operation. This
invalidates kubeconfig files and authentication configuration files that were
issued and distributed based on the old CA. These credentials stop working
after a CA rotation. The following instructions include details on how to
download a new user cluster kubeconfig from the admin cluster and regenerate
authentication configuration files after the CA rotation completes.
Note the following limitation with advanced clusters:
Version 1.31: CA rotation isn't supported on
advanced clusters .
Version 1.32 and higher: CA rotation is supported on advanced clusters, but
there are some minor differences noted where applicable in this document.
CA certificate rotation is limited to the etcd, cluster, and
front-proxy CAs mentioned previously.
CA certificate rotation is limited to certificates issued automatically by
Google Distributed Cloud. It doesn't update certificates issued manually by an
administrator, even if those certificates are signed by the system CAs.
A CA rotation restarts the API server, other control-plane processes, and
each node in the cluster multiple times. Each stage of a CA rotation
progresses similarly to a cluster upgrade. While the user cluster does remain
operational during a CA rotation, you should expect that workloads to be
restarted and rescheduled. You should also expect brief periods of
control-plane downtime if your user cluster does not have a
high-availability control plane .
You must update the user cluster kubeconfig file and authentication
configuration files after a CA rotation. This is because the old cluster
certificate is revoked, and the credentials in the kubeconfig file no
longer work.
After a CA rotation is started, it cannot be paused or rolled-back.
A CA rotation might take considerable time to complete, depending on the size of
the user cluster.
Perform a CA rotation
Start the rotation:
gkectl update credentials certificate-authorities rotate \
--config USER_CLUSTER_CONFIG \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
USER_CLUSTER_CONFIG : the path of the user cluster
configuration file
ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG : the path of the admin cluster
kubeconfig file
The behavior of the command differs depending on whether advanced cluster
is enabled:
Not enabled
If advanced cluster isn't enabled on the cluster, the command is asynchronous
and starts the CA rotation and then exits. You don't need to watch the
output of the command for the entire duration of the CA rotation. Instead, you
can periodically check on the progress by running the
gkectl update credentials certificate-authorities status command.
If the CA rotation starts successfully, you see a message similar to
following:
successfully started the CA rotation with CAVersion 2, use gkectl update credentials certificate-authorities status command to view the current state of CA rotation
If a CA rotation is already in progress, you see an error message similar
to the following:
Exit with error:
admission webhook "vonpremusercluster.onprem.cluster.gke.io" denied the request: requests must not modify CAVersion when cluster is not ready: ready condition is not true: ClusterCreateOrUpdate: Creating or updating user cluster control plane workloads
To view the status of the rotation:
gkectl update credentials certificate-authorities status \
--config USER_CLUSTER_CONFIG \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
The preceding command reports the CAVersion , which is an integer the
system automatically increments to differentiate the CAs used before and
after a rotation. The command also reports a status ( True or False )
that indicates whether the CA rotation is complete, and a message describing
which CAVersion is currently in use by each component of the system.
If the CA rotation has already completed, you see a message similar to
this:
State of CARotation with CAVersion 2 is -
status: True,
reason: CARotationCompleted,
message: Control plane has CA bundle [2], certs from CA 2, CA 2 is CSR signer. Data plane has CA bundle [2], CA 2 was CSR signer at last restart.
If the CA rotation is still in progress, you see a message similar to this:
State of CARotation with CAVersion 2 is -
status: False,
reason: CARotationProgressed,
message: Control plane has CA bundle [1 2], certs from CA 2, CA 1 is CSR signer. Data plane has CA bundle [1 2], CA 1 was CSR signer at last restart.
Update user cluster credentials
On clusters that don't have advanced cluster enabled, you must get a new user
cluster kubeconfig file from the admin cluster. This is because the CA
rotation revokes the CA that the old kubeconfig file was based on.
Get a new kubeconfig file:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get secret admin \
-n USER_CLUSTER_NAME -o jsonpath='{.data.admin\.conf}' \
| base64 --decode > USER_CLUSTER_NAME -kubeconfig
Enabled
If advanced cluster is enabled, the gkectl update credentials
certificate-authorities rotate command is synchronous. The command outputs
status messages to the admin workstation as the CA rotation progresses.
After the CA is rotated successfully, the command exits and a new kubeconfig
file is automatically generated. The command output provides the name of the
new kubeconfig file, and is similar to the following:
Beginning CA rotation with generated CA
...
Successfully rotated CA for user cluster " USER_CLUSTER_NAME ". The
kubeconfig file "/home/ubuntu"/ USER_CLUSTER_NAME -kubeconfig" has
been updated.
The new kubeconfig is located in the same directory as the admin cluster
kubeconfig that you specified in the command. The name of the new kubeconfig
is USER_CLUSTER_NAME -kubeconfig .
Distribute the new kubeconfig file
Distribute the new kubeconfig file to everyone who uses a kubeconfig file to
interact with the cluster.
Update authentication configuration files
After the CA rotation completes, authentication configuration files must be
updated and redistributed. For more information see
Manage user identity .
Control plane certificates rotation
Without rotation, both the user cluster CAs and control-plane certificates
expire five years from the date the cluster was created. The user cluster's
control-plane certificates are automatically rotated within ten hours of each
user cluster upgrade, but the CAs are not automatically rotated. This means a
CA rotation must be performed at least once every five years in addition to
regular version upgrades.
To prevent a user cluster from becoming unavailable, control-plane certificates
are rotated within ten hours following a user cluster upgrade. When this
happens, a message appears in the user cluster's CA rotation status.
To view the last version a user cluster has been upgraded to when control-plane
certificates were rotated:
gkectl update credentials certificate-authorities status \
--config USER_CLUSTER_CONFIG \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
The information appears at the end of the message field within ten hours of an
upgrade. For example:
Last Leaf Certificates Rotation Version: 1.16.0-gke.0.
Troubleshooting a CA rotation
The gkectl diagnose command supports checking the expected status of a
completed CA rotation against a user-cluster. For instructions on how to run
gkectl diagnose on a user cluster, see
Diagnosing cluster issues .
If you experience issues with a CA rotation, contact Google support and
provide the gkectl diagnose output.
Note: Because this command checks for the expected end state of a CA rotation,
it is expected for it to report that some certificates have not yet been rotated
when run during a CA rotation.
