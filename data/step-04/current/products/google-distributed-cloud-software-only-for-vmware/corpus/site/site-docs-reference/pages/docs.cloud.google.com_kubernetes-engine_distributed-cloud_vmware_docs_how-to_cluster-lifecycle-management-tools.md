Choose a tool to manage cluster lifecycle
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Distributed Cloud provides you a choice of tools to create clusters and
manage the cluster lifecycle operations (update, upgrade, and delete):
The command-line tool gkectl , which you run on your admin workstation
in your on-premises data center. You create a
configuration file
that describes the cluster network, load balancing, and other cluster
features. You specify this file on the command line to gkectl .
The Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or
Terraform ,
which you can run from any computer that has network connectivity to the
GKE On-Prem API. These standard tools use the
GKE On-Prem API ,
which runs on Google Cloud infrastructure. Collectively, the standard
tools are referred to as the GKE On-Prem API clients . To manage the
lifecycle of your clusters, the GKE On-Prem API must store metadata about
your cluster's state in Google Cloud, in the Google Cloud region that you
specify when creating the cluster. This metadata lets the API manage the
cluster lifecycle and doesn't include workload-specific data.
No matter which tool you use to create clusters, the information that
you gather and provide to the tool, such as the IP addresses
of cluster node machines and load balancer VIPs, is the same.
This selection lets you choose the best tool for your use case and
environment. For example:
For your first installations in a development environment, you might
want to use the Google Cloud console because the user interface provides
additional guidance and help.
If your organization already uses the gcloud CLI or Terraform to
manage other Google Cloud resources, you will probably want to use these
tools for Google Distributed Cloud as well.
If your organization has regulatory requirements or restrictions, you
might need to limit your reliance on Google Cloud and use gkectl on
your admin workstation to create clusters and manage cluster lifecycle.
If you create a cluster with gkectl , it will be enrolled with the
GKE On-Prem API by default. You can also
enroll the cluster after it is created,
which lets you use the GKE On-Prem API clients.
Limitations with the GKE On-Prem API clients
The gkectl tool is the most mature as far as features that it supports. We
recommend that you review the capabilities for the GKE On-Prem API clients when
making a choice. The following features aren't supported by the GKE On-Prem API
clients:
Secret management and rotation
Certificate rotation
Authentication
Usage metering
Application level logging and monitoring
Advanced networking
Windows node pools
The following list describes additional limitations with the GKE On-Prem API
clients:
The gcloud CLI isn't supported for any admin cluster lifecycle
operation. You can use gkectl , the console, the
gcloud CLI, or Terraform to create admin clusters.
The gkectl command-line tool is the only tool available for upgrading,
updating, and deleting admin clusters.
Only gkectl and Terraform support using a
private registry .
The kind of load balancer for an admin cluster and its user clusters must be
the same. The only exception is if the admin cluster uses Seesaw, then the
user clusters can use MetalLB. If you want your admin and user clusters to use
different kinds of load balancers, you must create the clusters using
gkectl .
When you create a user cluster using the Google Cloud console, all the
vCenter settings
are inherited from the admin cluster. If you need a user cluster to have
different vCenter settings from its admin cluster, use the
gcloud CLI, Terraform, or gkectl to create the user cluster.
Advanced cluster limitations
When you create a cluster, whether Google Distributed Cloud creates an advanced cluster
or a non-advanced cluster by default depends on the version, as follows:
Version 1.32 or lower: a non-advanced cluster is created by default.
Version 1.33 or higher: an advanced cluster is created default.
Only Terraform and the gkectl command-line tool have the ability to change the
default behavior. To change the default behavior, do the following:
gkectl : include the enableAdvancedCluster boolean field in your
cluster configuration file. For example, to create an advanced cluster with
a 1.32 version, specify enableAdvancedCluster: true in your cluster
configuration file.
Terraform: include the enable_advanced_cluster boolean field in your
configuration file (typically called main.tf ). For example, to create an
advanced cluster with a 1.32 version, add enable_advanced_cluster = true to
main.tf .
Only the gkectl command-line tool is supported in the following cases:
When upgrading a non-advanced cluster to an advanced cluster.
When upgrading a cluster from 1.32 to 1.33.
For more information, see
Update or upgrade a cluster to an advanced cluster .
The GKE On-Prem API clients have limitations on the create, upgrade, update,
and delete operations, as captured in the following table. Only the gkectl
command-line tool is supported for all operations, with the exception of
admin cluster delete. Deleting an admin cluster is a special case, which
involves deleting Google Cloud resources, load balancer resources, the VM, and
vSphere data disk. For more information, see
Deleting an admin cluster .
Use the following drop-down menus to filter the table by client and cluster
type:

Console
gcloud CLI
Terraform
Select a cluster type
Non-advanced user cluster
