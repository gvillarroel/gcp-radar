Admin cluster configuration file 1.30 and higher
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the fields in the admin cluster configuration file for
versions 1.30 and higher Google Distributed Cloud.
Generating a template for your configuration file
If you used gkeadm to create your admin workstation, then gkeadm generated
a template for your admin cluster configuration file. Also, gkeadm filled in
some of the fields for you.
If you did not use gkeadm to create your admin workstation, you can use
gkectl to generate a template for your admin cluster configuration file.
To generate a template for your admin cluster configuration file:
gkectl create-config admin --config= OUTPUT_FILENAME --gke-on-prem-version= VERSION
Replace the following:
OUTPUT_FILENAME : a path of your choice for the
generated template. If you omit this flag, gkectl names the file
admin-cluster.yaml and puts it in the current directory.
VERSION : the Google Distributed Cloud version number. For example:
gkectl create-config admin --gke-on-prem-version=1.34.200-gke.68 .
This version must be equal to or less than your gkectl version. If you omit
this flag, the generated config template is populated with values based on the
latest 1.34 patch.

Required fields and default values
If a field is marked as Required , then the completed configuration file must
have a value filled in for the field.
If a Default value is given for a field, then the cluster will use that value
if you don't enter anything for the field. You can override a default value by
entering a value.
If a field is not marked as Required, then the field is optional. You can fill
it in if it is relevant for you, but you don't have to fill it in.
Filling in your configuration file
In your configuration file, enter field values as described in the following
sections.
enableAdvancedCluster
1.33 and higher
All new clusters are created as advanced clusters. If you include this field
in your configuration file when creating a new cluster, it must be set to
true . If you set this field to false , cluster creation will be blocked.

new features and capabilities, such as
topology domains .
This field is required if
infraConfigFilePath is configured.
Be sure to review
Differences when running advanced clusters
before enabling advanced cluster.

This section holds information about NTP servers, DNS servers, and DNS search
domains used by the VMs that are your cluster nodes.
If infraConfigFilePath is configured,
remove this entire section. Otherwise, this section is required and
immutable.
network.hostConfig.dnsServers
Required if network.hostConfig section is filled in.
Immutable
Array of strings.
The maximum number of elements in the array is three.
The addresses of DNS servers for the VMs.
Example:
network:

Array of strings
DNS search domains for the VMs to use. These domains are
used as part of a domain search list.
Example:
network:
hostConfig:
searchDomainsForDNS:
- "my.local.com"
network.ipMode.type
Immutable
String
Prepopulated: "static"
Default: "dhcp"
If you want your cluster nodes to get their IP address from a DHCP server,
set this to "dhcp" . If you want your cluster nodes to have static IP
addresses chosen from a list that you provide, set this to "static" .
In most cases you should specify static because you always have to provide IP
addresses for the admin cluster's control-plane nodes. DHCP is used only to
provide IP addresses in the following cases:
If enableControlplaneV2
isn't enabled in user clusters, then you can use DHCP for the user
cluster's control-plane nodes, which are in the admin cluster.
In version 1.16 and lower, add-on nodes for non-HA admin clusters can get
their IP addresses from DHCP. In version 1.28 and higher, admin clusters
are required to be HA, and they don't have add-on nodes.
Example:
network:
ipMode:
type: "static"
network.ipMode.ipBlockFilePath
The absolute or relative path of the
IP block file for your cluster.
If infraConfigFilePath is configured,
this field is required.
This field is also required in the following cases:
1.16 and lower non-HA admin cluster: list the IP addresses for the
control-plane node and add-on nodes in an IP block file.
1.16 and lower HA admin cluster: list the IP addresses for add-on nodes
in an IP block file.
1.29 and lower kubeception user clusters: list the IP addresses for
the user cluster control-plane nodes in the admin cluster IP block file.
Immutable
String
Example:
network:
ipMode:
ipBlockFilePath: "/my-config-folder/admin-cluster-ipblock.yaml"
network.serviceCIDR
Required
Immutable
String
Smallest possible range: /24
Largest possible range: /12
Prepopulated: "10.96.232.0/24"
A range of IP addresses, in CIDR format, to be used for Services in your
cluster.
Example:
network:
serviceCIDR: "10.96.232.0/24"
network.podCIDR
Required
Immutable
String
Smallest possible range: /18
Largest possible range: /8
Prepopulated: "192.168.0.0/16"
A range of IP addresses, in CIDR format, to be used for Pods in your
cluster.
Example:
network:
podCIDR: "192.168.0.0/16"
The Service range must not overlap with the Pod range.
The Service and Pod ranges must not overlap with any address outside the cluster
that you want to reach from inside the cluster.
For example, suppose your Service range is 10.96.232.0/24, and your Pod range is
192.168.0.0/16. Any traffic sent from a Pod to an address in either of those
ranges will be treated as in-cluster and will not reach any destination outside
the cluster.
In particular, the Service and Pod ranges must not overlap with:
IP addresses of nodes in any cluster
IP addresses used by load balancer machines
VIPs used by control-plane nodes and load balancers
IP address of vCenter servers, DNS servers, and NTP servers
We recommend that your Service and Pod ranges be in the
RFC 1918
address space.
Here is one reason for the recommendation to use RFC 1918 addresses. Suppose
your Pod or Service range contains external IP addresses. Any traffic sent from
a Pod to one of those external addresses will be treated as in-cluster traffic
and will not reach the external destination.
network.vCenter.networkName
The name of the vSphere network for your cluster nodes.
If infraConfigFilePath is configured,
remove this field. Otherwise, this field is required and immutable.
Example:
network:
vCenter:
networkName: "my-network"
If the name contains a special character, you must use an escape sequence for it.
Special characters
Escape sequence
Slash ( / )
%2f
Backslash ( \ )
%5c
Percent sign ( % )
%25
If the network name is not unique in your data center, you can specify a full
path.
Example:
network:
vCenter:
networkName: "/data-centers/data-center-1/network/my-network"
network.controlPlaneIPBlock
Network information for the admin cluster's control-plane nodes.
If infraConfigFilePath is configured,
remove this entire section. Otherwise, this section is required and
immutable.
network.controlPlaneIPBlock.netmask
Required
Immutable
String
The netmask for the network that has your control-plane nodes.
Example:
network:
controlPlaneIPBlock:
netmask: "255.255.255.0"
network.controlPlaneIPBlock.gateway
Required
Immutable
String
The IP address of the default gateway for your control-plane nodes.
Example:
network:
controlPlaneIPBlock:
gateway: "172.16.22.1"
network.controlPlaneIPBlock.ips
Required
Immutable
Array of three objects, each of which has an IP address and an optional
hostname.
These are the IP addresses that will be assigned to your control-plane nodes. Hostnames are required for HA admin clusters.
Example:
network:
controlPlaneIPBlock:
ips:
- ip: "172.16.22.6"
hostname: "admin-cp-vm-1"
- ip: "172.16.22.7"
hostname: "admin-cp-vm-2"
- ip: "172.16.22.8"
hostname: "admin-cp-vm-3"

topology domains .
Preview
Optional
String
Mutable
Specify the full path of the vSphere infrastructure configuration file.
Example:
infraConfigFilePath: "/my-config-folder/vsphere-infrastructure.yaml"
In addition to adding the path, copy the
vSphere infrastructure configuration file
to the applicable directory.
If you add a path to infraConfigFilePath , you need to make the following
changes to your admin cluster and user cluster configuration files.

loadBalancer.kind
Specify the kind of load balancer to use.
1.32 and higher
Required
Immutable
String
Prepopulated: "MetalLB"
The kind of load balancer that you can use depends on whether you will
set up the cluster to use
topology domains . The
cluster is assumed to use topology domains if the
infraConfigFilePath field is configured.
With topology domains: set this to "ManualLB" . You must
configure a third-party load balancer (such as F5 BIG-IP or
Citrix) if you want to use topology domains.
Without topology domains: set this to "ManualLB" or "MetalLB" .
Use "ManualLB" if you have a third-party load balancer or "MetalLB" for
our bundled solution.
If enableAdvancedCluster
is set to true (advanced cluster enabled), the kind of load balancer for
the control-plane nodes is determined by
adminMaster.controlPlaneLoadBalancer .
Example:

Prepopulated: "MetalLB"
String. Set this to "ManualLB" , "F5BigIP" , "Seesaw" , or "MetalLB"
If you set adminMaster.replicas to 3 , then you can't use the Seesaw load
balancer.
Example:
loadBalancer :
kind : "MetalLB"
When you create user clusters using the Google Cloud console, the
gcloud CLI, or Terraform, the kind of load balancer for the admin
cluster and its user clusters must be the same. The only exception is if the
admin cluster uses Seesaw, then the user clusters can use MetalLB. If you want
your admin and user clusters to use different kinds of load balancers, you must
create user clusters using the gkectl command-line tool.
loadBalancer.manualLB
If you set loadbalancer.kind to "ManualLB" , fill in this section. Otherwise,
remove this section.

loadBalancer.f5BigIP
1.30 and higher
In version 1.30 and higher, the value "F5BigIP" isn't allowed for
loadbalancer.kind for new admin clusters. If the loadBalancer.f5BigIP
section is in your configuration file, remove it or comment it out.
You can still use your F5 BIG-IP load balancer with new admin clusters,
but the configuration is different. For configuration details, see
Enabling manual load balancing mode .
If an existing cluster has this section configured, upgrades to
version 1.32 are blocked. You must

loadBalancer.seesaw
Don't use this section. The Seesaw load balancer is not supported for new
admin clusters in version 1.28 and higher. Instead, we recommend that you
configure the MetalLB load balancer for new admin clusters. For more
information on configuring MetalLB, see
Bundled load balancing with MetalLB .
Although we still support Seesaw for non-HA admin clusters that have been
upgraded, we recommend that you
migrate to MetalLB .
antiAffinityGroups.enabled
Optional
Mutable
Boolean
Prepopulated: true
Set this to true to enable DRS rule creation. Otherwise, set this to
false .
If this field is true , Google Distributed Cloud creates VMware
Distributed Resource Scheduler
(DRS) anti-affinity rules for your admin cluster nodes, causing them to be
spread across at least three physical ESXi hosts in your datacenter.
This feature requires that your vSphere environment meets the following
conditions:
VMware DRS is enabled. VMware DRS requires vSphere Enterprise Plus license
edition.
Your vSphere user account has the
Host.Inventory.Modify cluster
privilege.
There are at least four ESXi hosts available.
Even though the rule requires that the cluster nodes are spread across three
ESXi hosts, we strongly recommend that you have at least four ESXi hosts
available. This protects you from losing your admin cluster control plane. For
example, suppose you have only three ESXi hosts, and your admin cluster
control-plane node is on an ESXi host that fails. The DRS rule will prevent the
control-plane node from being placed on one of the remaining two ESXi hosts.
Recall that if you have a
vSphere Standard license ,
you cannot enable VMware DRS.
If you don't have DRS enabled, or if you don't have at least four hosts where
vSphere VMs can be scheduled, set antiAffinityGroups.enabled to false .
Note the following limitation with advanced clusters:
Version 1.31: if the
enableAdvancedCluster field is true ,
anti-affinity rules aren't supported on advanced clusters, and you must set
antiAffinityGroups.enabled to false .
Version 1.32: anti-affinity rules are supported on advanced clusters.
Example:
antiAffinityGroups:
enabled: true
adminMaster
Immutable
Configuration settings for the control-plane nodes in the admin cluster.
adminMaster.controlPlaneLoadBalancer
1.32 and higher
Optionally, include this section to specify the kind of load balancer to use
for control-plane traffic in the admin cluster. Include
adminMaster.controlPlaneLoadBalancer.mode in your configuration file
if you want to explicitly set the kind of load balancer to use rather than
relying on the default value. Additionally, you must set
loadBalancer.kind in your configuration file
even though the field is a no-op in 1.32 and higher.
adminMaster.controlPlaneLoadBalancer.mode
Optional
Immutable
String
Default: Depends on whether the cluster uses topology domains
The kind of load balancer that you can use depends on whether you will
set up the cluster to use
topology domains . The
cluster is assumed to use topology domains if the
infraConfigFilePath field is configured.
With topology domains: specify "manual" , which is the default
value. You must configure a third-party load balancer (such as F5 BIG-IP or
Citrix) if you want to use topology domains.
Without topology domains: specify either "manual" or "bundled" .
Use "manual" if you have a third-party load balancer or "bundled" for
our bundled solution, which uses
keepalived + haproxy
running on the three admin cluster control-plane nodes. The default value is
" bundled" .
Example:
adminMaster :
controlPlaneLoadBalancer :
mode : "manual"

adminMaster.replicas
1.28 and higher
Required for new clusters
Immutable
Integer
Possible values: 3
The number of control-plane nodes in the admin cluster. In 1.28 and higher,
new admin clusters must be highly available (HA). Set this field to 3 to
create an HA admin cluster with 3 control plane nodes.
Example:
adminMaster :
replicas : 3
1.16 and lower
Optional
Immutable
Integer
Possible values: 1 or 3
Prepopulated: 1
Default: 1
The number of control-plane nodes in the admin cluster. Set this to 3 if you
want to create a high-availability admin cluster. Otherwise, set it to 1 .
If you set this to 3 , then you must also fill in the
network.controlPlaneIPBlock section
and the
network.hostConfig section.
If you set this to 3 , then you cannot use the Seesaw load balancer.

1.32 and higher
Preview
Optional
Array of strings | Allows one element or three different elements
Immutable
Default: vSphereInfraConfig.defaultTopologyDomain if specified in the
vSphere infrastructure configuration file
An array of topology domains. If
infraConfigFilePath is configured
(which indicates the cluster will use
topology domains ), optionally
include this field. The number of topology domains in the array determines
how the admin cluster control-plane nodes are deployed, as follows:
One element: all three admin cluster control-plane nodes will be
deployed in the specified topology domain.
Three elements: each admin cluster control-plane node will be deployed
in a different topology domain (that is, one node per topology domain).
1.31 and higher

include this field. The admin cluster control-plane nodes will be deployed in
the specified topology domain.
1.30 and lower
Not available.
addonNode.autoResize.enabled
1.28 and higher
Don't include this setting in your configuration file when creating a new
cluster. Admin clusters created in version 1.28 and higher must be highly

proxy
If your network is behind a proxy server, fill in this section. Otherwise,
remove this section or leave it commented out. The proxy server you specify
here is used by the user clusters that this admin cluster manages.
Immutable
proxy.url
Required if proxy section is filled in.
Immutable
String
The HTTP address of your proxy server. Include the port number even if it's the
same as the scheme's default port.
Example:
proxy:
url: "http://my-proxy.example.local:80"
The proxy server you specify here is used by your Google Distributed Cloud
clusters. Also, your admin workstation is automatically configured to use this
same proxy server unless you set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on your
admin workstation.
If you specify proxy.url , you must also specify proxy.noProxy .
After the proxy configuration for the admin cluster has been set, it cannot be
modified or deleted, unless the cluster is rebuilt.
proxy.noProxy
Optional
Immutable
String
A comma-separated list of IP addresses, IP address ranges, host names,
and domain names that should not go through the proxy server. When
Google Distributed Cloud sends a request to one of these addresses, hosts, or
domains, the request is sent directly.
Example:
proxy:
noProxy: "10.151.222.0/24,my-host.example.local,10.151.2.1"
privateRegistry
A private container
registry
is a registry where access to container images is restricted to
authenticated users. Fill in this section if your user clusters need to
access workload images. When you configure the privateRegistry section, all
user clusters managed by this admin cluster will pull workload images from the
private registry that you configure here.
If you configure the privateRegistry section, when you run gkectl prepare
before cluster creation or upgrade, gkectl pushes the Google Distributed Cloud system
images to the private registry. During the cluster creation or upgrade,
system images are pulled from the private registry. If you don't configure the
privateRegistry section, system images are pulled from
gcr.io/gke-on-prem-release using the
component access service account .
You might want to configure the privateRegistry section so that clusters pull
system images from the private registry instead of gcr.io/gke-on-prem-release
in the following cases:
You need to minimize connections to Google Cloud because of security concerns
or regulatory requirements.
Your organization requires outbound traffic to pass through a proxy server,
and the network speed to connect to Google Cloud is slow.
If you want to use Google's Artifact Registry as a private registry, see
Use Artifact Registry as a private registry for workload images
for the configuration steps.
privateRegistry.address
Required for private registry
Immutable
String

address: "fqdn.example.com"
privateRegistry.credentials.fileRef.path
Required for private registry
Mutable
String
The path of a
credentials configuration file
that holds the username and password of an account that Google Distributed Cloud
can use to access your private registry.
Example:
privateRegistry:
credentials:
fileRef:
path: "my-config-folder/admin-creds.yaml"
privateRegistry.credentials.fileRef.entry
Required for private registry
Mutable
String
The name of the credentials block, in your
credentials configuration file ,
that holds the username and password of your private registry account.
privateRegistry:
credentials:
fileRef:
entry: "private-registry-creds"
privateRegistry.caCertPath
Required for private registry
Mutable
String
When the container runtime pulls an image from your private registry, the
registry must prove its identity by presenting a certificate. The registry's
certificate is signed by a certificate authority (CA). The container runtime
uses the CA's certificate to validate the registry's certificate.
Set this field to the path of the CA's certificate.
Example:
privateRegistry:
caCertPath: "my-cert-folder/registry-ca.crt"
componentAccessServiceAccountKeyPath
Required
Mutable
String
The path of the JSON key file for your component access service account.
Example:
componentAccessServiceAccountKeyPath: "my-key-folder/access-key.json"
gkeConnect
Required
Mutable
When you fill in the gkeConnect section, the admin cluster is automatically
registered to a fleet after it is
created. This section holds information about the Google Cloud project and service
account needed to register the cluster.
During cluster creation or update, several
RBAC policies are
configured on the admin cluster. These RBAC policies are needed so that you can
create user clusters in the Google Cloud console.
gkeConnect.projectID
Required
Immutable
String
The ID of your
fleet host project .
For new clusters, this project ID must be the same as the ID set in
stackdriver.projectID and cloudAuditLogging.projectID . If the project IDs
aren't the same, cluster creation fails. This requirement isn't applied to
existing clusters.
Example:
gkeConnect:
projectID: "my-fleet-host-project"
gkeConnect.location
Optional
Immutable
String
Default: global
Each cluster's fleet membership is managed by the Fleet service
( gkehub.googleapis.com ) and the Connect service
( gkeconnect.googleapis.com ). The location of the services can be global
or regional. In 1.28 and later, you can optionally specify the Google Cloud
region in which the Fleet and the Connect services run. If not specified,
the global instances of the services are used. Note the following:
Admin clusters created prior to 1.28 are managed by the global Fleet and
Connect services.
For new clusters, if you include this field, the region that you specify must
be the same as the region configured in cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation ,
stackdriver.clusterLocation , and gkeOnPremAPI.location . If the regions
aren't the same, cluster creation fails.
Example:
gkeConnect:

gkeOnPremAPI
Optional
In 1.16 and later, if the GKE On-Prem API is enabled in your
Google Cloud project, all clusters in the project are
enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API
automatically in the region configured in stackdriver.clusterLocation .
If you want to enroll all clusters in the project in the GKE On-Prem API,
be sure to do the steps in
Before you begin to
activate and use the GKE On-Prem API in the project.
If you don't want to enroll the cluster in the GKE On-Prem API, include
this section and set gkeOnPremAPI.enabled to false . If you don't
want to enroll any clusters in the project, disable
gkeonprem.googleapis.com (the service name for the GKE On-Prem API)
in the project. For instructions, see
Disabling services .
Enrolling your admin cluster in the GKE On-Prem API lets you use standard
tools—the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, or
Terraform —to upgrade
user clusters that the admin cluster manages. Enrolling your cluster also lets
you run gcloud commands to
get information about your clusters .
After you add this section and create or update the admin cluster, if
subsequently you remove the section and update the cluster, the update will
fail.
gkeOnPremAPI.enabled
Required if the gkeOnPremAPI section is included.
Mutable
Boolean
Default: true
By default, the cluster is enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API if the
GKE On-Prem API is enabled in your project. Set to false if you
don't want to enroll the cluster.
After the cluster is enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API, if you need to
unenroll the cluster, make the following change and then update the cluster:
gkeOnPremAPI:
enabled: false
gkeOnPremAPI.location
Immutable
String
Default: stackdriver.clusterLocation
The Google Cloud region where the GKE On-Prem API runs and stores
cluster metadata. Choose one of the
supported regions .
You must use the same region that is configured in
cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation , gkeConnect.location ,
and stackdriver.clusterLocation . If gkeOnPremAPI.enabled is false ,
don't include this field.
stackdriver
Required
Mutable
stackdriver.projectID
Required for Logging and Monitoring
Immutable
String
The ID of your
fleet host project .
For new clusters, this project ID must be the same as the ID set in
gkeConnect.projectID and cloudAuditLogging.projectID . If the project IDs
aren't the same, cluster creation fails. This requirement isn't applied to
existing clusters.
If needed, you can configure a log router in this project to route logs into
log buckets in another project. For information on how to configure the log
router, see Supported destinations .
Example:
stackdriver:
projectID: "my-fleet-host-project"
stackdriver.clusterLocation
Required for Logging and Monitoring
Immutable
String
Prepopulated: "us-central1"
The Google Cloud region where you want to route and store
Cloud Monitoring metrics. We recommend that you choose a region that's near
your on-premises data center.
You specify the Cloud Logging logs routing and storage location in the
Log Router configuration. For more information about logs routing, see
Routing and storage overview .
The Stackdriver Operator ( stackdriver-operator ) attaches the value from this
field to each log entry and metric before they're routed to Google Cloud. These
attached labels can be useful for filtering your logs and metrics in the
Logs Explorer and Metrics Explorer respectively.
For new clusters, if you include the gkeOnPremAPI and cloudAuditLogging
sections in the configuration file, the region that you set here must be
the same region that you set in cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation ,
gkeConnect.location , and gkeOnPremAPI.location . If the regions aren't
the same, cluster creation fails.
Example:
stackdriver:
clusterLocation: "us-central1"
stackdriver.serviceAccountKeyPath
Required for Logging and Monitoring
Mutable
String
The path of the JSON key file for your logging-monitoring service account.
If you will be creating the cluster with
enableAdvancedCluster set to true
(which is required for
setting up topology domains ),
then stackdriver.serviceAccountKeyPath must be the same as
cloudAuditLogging.serviceAccountKeyPath .
For information on how to update this field in an existing cluster, see
Rotating service account
keys .
Example:
stackdriver:
serviceAccountKeyPath: "my-key-folder/log-mon-key.json"
stackdriver.disableVsphereResourceMetrics
Optional
Mutable
Relevant for Logging and Monitoring
Boolean
Prepopulated: false
Default: false
Set this to true to disable the collection of metrics from vSphere.
Otherwise, set it to false .
This section is required in the admin cluster if you want to manage the
lifecycle of
user clusters in the Google Cloud console .
Example:
stackdriver:
disableVsphereResourceMetrics: true
cloudAuditLogging
If you want to integrate the audit logs from your cluster's Kubernetes API
server with Cloud Audit Logs, fill in this section. Otherwise, remove this
section or leave it commented out.
Mutable
This section is required in the admin cluster if you want to manage the
lifecycle of
user clusters in using GKE On-Prem API clients .
cloudAuditLogging.projectID
Required for Cloud Audit Logs
Immutable
String
The ID of your fleet host project .
For new clusters, this project ID must be the same as the ID set in
gkeConnect.projecID and stackdriver.projectID . If the project IDs
aren't the same, cluster creation fails. This requirement isn't applied to
existing clusters.
If needed, you can configure a log router in this project to route logs into
log buckets in another project. For information on how to configure the log
router, see Supported destinations .
Example:
cloudAuditLogging:
projectID: "my-fleet-host-project"
cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation
Required for Cloud Audit Logs
Immutable
String
The Google Cloud region where you want to store audit logs. It is
a good idea to choose a region that is near your on-premises data center
For new clusters, if you include the gkeOnPremAPI and stackdriver
sections in the configuration file, the region that you set here must be
the same region that you set in gkeConnect.location , gkeOnPremAPI.location ,
and stackdriver.clusterLocation . If the regions aren't the same, cluster
creation fails.
Example:
cloudAuditLogging:
clusterLocation: "us-central1"
cloudAuditLogging.serviceAccountKeyPath
Required for Cloud Audit Logs
Mutable
String
The path of the JSON key file for your audit-logging service account.
If you will be creating the cluster with
enableAdvancedCluster set to true
(which is required for
setting up topology domains ),
then cloudAuditLogging.serviceAccountKeyPath must be the same as
stackdriver.serviceAccountKeyPath .
For information on how to update this field in an existing cluster, see
Rotating service account
keys .
Example:
cloudAuditLogging:
serviceAccountKeyPath: "my-key-folder/audit-log-key.json"
clusterBackup.datastore
Optional
Mutable
String
By default, cluster backup tar files are saved to the directory
gkectl-workspace/backups on your admin workstation. If you want to store
cluster backup files in vSphere, set this field to the vSphere datastore where
you want to save the backups.
Example:
clusterBackup :
datastore : "my-datastore"
Note the following support differences for this field:
For advanced clusters:
Version 1.31: remove clusterBackup.datastore from your configuration file.
Backing up clusters to a vSphere datastore isn't supported.
Version 1.32: clusterBackup.datastore is in Preview
Version 1.33 and higher: clusterBackup.datastore is GA.
For non-advanced clusters, clusterBackup.datastore remains in Preview.
For more information see the following:
Non-advanced clusters: Back up and restore an admin cluster with gkectl
Advanced clusters: Back up and restore advanced clusters with gkectl
autoRepair.enabled
Optional
Mutable
Boolean
Prepopulated: true
Set this to true to enable
node auto repair .
Otherwise, set this to false .
To update the value of this field, use gkectl update admin .
Example:
autoRepair:
enabled: true
secretsEncryption
If you want to encrypt Secrets without the need for an external KMS
(Key Management Service), or any other dependencies, fill in this section.
Otherwise, remove this section or leave it commented out.
Immutable
If you will be creating the cluster with
enableAdvancedCluster set to true
(which is required for
setting up topology domains ),
then remove this section. This feature isn't supported with advanced clusters.
secretsEncryption.mode
Required for Secrets encryption
Immutable
String
Possible value: "GeneratedKey"
Prepopulated: "GeneratedKey"
The Secret encryption mode.
secretsEncryption:
mode: "GeneratedKey"
secretsEncryption.generatedKey.keyVersion
Required for Secrets encryption
Mutable
Integer
Prepopulated: 1
An integer of your choice to use for the key version number. We recommended that
you start with 1 .
Example:
secretsEncryption:
generatedKey:
keyVersion: 1
secretsEncryption.generatedKey.disabled
Optional for Secrets encryption
Mutable
Boolean
Prepopulated: false
Set this to true to disable Secrets encryption. Otherwise set it to false .
Example:
secretsEncryption:
generatedKey:
disabled: false
osImageType
Optional
Mutable
String
Possible values: "ubuntu_containerd", "cos", "ubuntu_cgv2", "cos_cgv2"
Prepopulated: "ubuntu_cgv2"
Default: "ubuntu_containerd"
The type of OS image to run on your admin cluster nodes.
Note the following limitation with advanced clusters:
Version 1.31: if the enableAdvancedCluster
field is true , only ubuntu-cgroupv2 and ubuntu_containerd are supported
on advanced clusters.
Version 1.32: All OS image types are supported on advanced clusters.
Example:
osImageType: "cos"
