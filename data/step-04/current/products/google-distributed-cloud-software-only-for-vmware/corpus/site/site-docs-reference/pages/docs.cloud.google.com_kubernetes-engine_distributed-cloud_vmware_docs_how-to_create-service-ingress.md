This document shows how to create a Kubernetes
Ingress
object in a user cluster for Google Distributed Cloud. An Ingress is
associated with one or more Services , each of which is
associated with a set of
Pods .
Before you begin
Get an
SSH connection
to your admin workstation:
Create a Deployment
Here's a manifest for a Deployment:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: hello-deployment
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
greeting: hello
replicas: 3
template:
metadata:
labels:
greeting: hello
spec:
containers:
- name: hello-world
image: "gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0"
env:
- name: "PORT"
value: "50000"
- name: hello-kubernetes
image: "gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0"
env:
- name: "PORT"
value: "8080"
For the purpose of this exercise, these are the important points to understand
about the Deployment manifest:
Each Pod that belongs to the Deployment has the greeting: hello label.
Each Pod has two containers.
The env fields specify that the hello-app containers listen on TCP
port 50000, and the node-hello containers listen on TCP port 8080. For
hello-app , you can see the effect of the PORT environment variable by
looking at the
hello-app source code .
Copy the manifest to a file named hello-deployment.yaml , and create the
Deployment:
kubectl apply --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG -f hello-deployment.yaml
where USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG is the path of the
kubeconfig file
for your user cluster.
Expose your Deployment with a Service
To provide a stable way for clients to send requests to the Pods of your
Deployment, create a Service.
Here's a manifest for a Service that exposes your Deployment to clients inside
your cluster:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: hello-service
spec:
type: ClusterIP
selector:
greeting: hello
ports:
- name: world-port
protocol: TCP
port: 60000
targetPort: 50000
- name: kubernetes-port
protocol: TCP
port: 60001
targetPort: 8080
Copy the manifest to a file named hello-service.yaml , and create the
Service:
kubectl apply --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG -f hello-service.yaml
View the Service:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get service hello-service --output yaml
The output shows the value of clusterIP that has been given to the Service.
For example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
annotations:
...
spec:
clusterIP: 10.96.14.249
clusterIPs:
- 10.96.14.249
ipFamilies:
- IPv4
ipFamilyPolicy: SingleStack
ports:
- name: world-port
port: 60000
protocol: TCP
targetPort: 50000
- name: kubernetes-port
port: 60001
protocol: TCP
targetPort: 8080
selector:
greeting: hello
sessionAffinity: None
type: ClusterIP
status:
loadBalancer: {}
In the preceding output, the ports field is an array of Kubernetes
ServicePort objects: one named world-port and one named kubernetes-port .
These are the ways a client can call the Service:
Using world-port : A client running on one of the cluster nodes sends a
request to the clusterIP on port . In this example, 10.96.14.249:60000.
The request is forwarded to a member Pod on targetPort . In this example,
POD_IP_ADDRESS :50000.
Using kubernetes-port : A client running on one of the cluster nodes
sends a request to the clusterIP on port . In this example,
10.96.14.249:60001. The request is forwarded to a member Pod on targetPort .
In this example, POD_IP_ADDRESS :8080.
Ingress components
These are some of the cluster components related to ingress:
The istio-ingress Deployment. This is the ingress proxy . The ingress
proxy forwards traffic to internal Services according to rules specified in
an Ingress object.
The istio-ingress Service. This Service exposes the istio-ingress
Deployment.
The istiod Deployment. This is the ingress controller . The ingress
controller watches the creation of
Ingress
objects and configures the ingress proxy accordingly.
Create an Ingress
Here's a manifest for an Ingress:
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: my-ingress
spec:
rules:
- http:
paths:
- path: /greet-the-world
pathType: Exact
backend:
service:
name: hello-service
port:
number: 60000
- path: /greet-kubernetes
pathType: Exact
backend:
service:
name: hello-service
port:
number: 60001
Copy the manifest to a file named my-ingress.yaml , and create the
Ingress:
kubectl apply --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG -f my-ingress.yaml
When you create a user cluster, you specify a value for
loadbalancer.ingressVip in the cluster configuration file. This IP address is
configured on the cluster load balancer. When you create an Ingress, the Ingress
is given this same VIP as its external IP address.
When a client sends a request to your user cluster ingress VIP, the request is
routed to your load balancer. The load balancer uses the istio-ingress Service
to forward the request to the ingress proxy, which runs in your user cluster. The
ingress proxy is configured to forward the request to different backends depending
on the path in the request URL.
The /greet-the-world path
In your Ingress manifest, you can see a rule that says the path
/greet-the-world is associated with serviceName: hello-service and
servicePort: 60000 . Recall that 60000 is the port value in the world-port
section of your hello-service Service.
- name: world-port
port: 60000
protocol: TCP
targetPort: 50000
The ingress Service forwards the request to clusterIP :50000. The request then
goes to one of the member Pods of the hello-service Service. The container, in
that Pod, listening on port 50000 displays a Hello World! message.
The /greet-kubernetes path
In your Ingress manifest, you can see a rule that says the path
/greet-kubernetes is associated with serviceName: hello-service and
servicePort: 60001 . Recall that 60001 is the port value in the
kubernetes-port section of your hello-service Service.
- name: kubernetes-port
port: 60001
protocol: TCP
targetPort: 8080
The ingress Service forwards the request to clusterIP : 8080. The request then
goes to one of the member Pods of the hello-service Service. The container, in
that Pod, listening on port 8080 displays a Hello Kubernetes! message.
Test the Ingress
Test the Ingress using the /greet-the-world path:
curl USER_CLUSTER_INGRESS_VIP/greet-the-world
Replace USER_CLUSTER_INGRESS_VIP with the external IP address of the Ingress.
The output shows a Hello, world! message:
Hello, world!
Version: 2.0.0
Hostname: ...
Test the Ingress using the /greet-kubernetes path:
curl USER_CLUSTER_INGRESS_VIP/greet-kubernetes
The output shows a Hello, Kubernetes! message:
Hello Kubernetes!
Set up HTTPS for Ingress
If you want to accept HTTPS requests from your clients, the ingress proxy must
have a certificate so it can prove its identity to your clients. This proxy
must also have a private key to complete the HTTPS handshake.
The following example uses these entities:
Ingress proxy: Participates in the HTTPS handshake, and then forwards packets
to member Pods of the hello-service Service.
Domain for the hello-service Service: altostrat.com in Example Org
Follow these steps:
Create a root certificate and private key. This example uses a root
certificate authority of root.ca.example.com in Root CA Example Org.
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj '/O=Root CA Example Inc./CN=root.ca.example.com' -keyout root-ca.key -out root-ca.crt
Create a certificate signing request:
openssl req -out server.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -subj "/CN=altostrat.com/O=Example Org"
Create a serving certificate for the ingress proxy.
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -CA root-ca.crt -CAkey root-ca.key -set_serial 0 -in server.csr -out server.crt
You have now created the following certificates and keys:
root-ca.crt : Certificate for the root CA
root-ca.key : Private key for the root CA
server.crt : Serving certificate for the ingress proxy
server.key : Private key for the ingress proxy
Create a Kubernetes Secret that holds the serving certificate and key.
kubectl create secret tls example-server-creds --key=server.key --cert=server.crt --namespace gke-system
The resulting Secret is named example-server-creds .
Note: TLS secrets must be defined in the gke-system namespace.
Create a Deployment and Service
If you created a Deployment and a Service in the HTTP portion of this guide,
leave those in place. If you did not, create them now,
following the steps described for HTTP .
Create an Ingress
Creating an Ingress for HTTPS is similar to creating an Ingress for
HTTP , but the Ingress spec for HTTPS includes a tls
section that specifies the host and a Secret. The hosts in the tls section
need to explicitly match the host in the rules section.
Warning: Don't create multiple Ingresses for the same host. When you use the
bundled ingress components , you're limited to a single
Ingress custom resource for a given host.
If your backend Service is in a separate namespace, then you need to create a
Service of type ExternalName
in the same namespace as the Ingress to route traffic to the backend Service.
If you previously created an Ingress in the HTTP portion, delete that Ingress
before proceeding.
Delete the Ingress:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG delete ingress my-ingress
To handle traffic for the Service that you created previously, create a new
Ingres that has a tls section. This will enable HTTPS between clients and the
ingress proxy.
Here's a manifest for an Ingress:
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: my-ingress-2
spec:
tls:
- hosts:
- altostrat.com
secretName: example-server-creds
rules:
- host: altostrat.com
http:
paths:
- path: /greet-the-world
pathType: Exact
backend:
service:
name: hello-service
port:
number: 60000
- path: /greet-kubernetes
pathType: Exact
backend:
service:
name: hello-service
port:
number: 60001
Save the manifest in a file named my-ingress-2.yaml , and create the Ingress:
kubectl apply --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG -f my-ingress-2.yaml
Confirm by testing.
Test the /greet-the-world path:
curl -v --resolve altostrat.com:443: USER_CLUSTER_INGRESS_VIP https://altostrat.com/greet-the-world --cacert root-ca.crt
Output:
Hello, world!
Version: 2.0.0
Hostname: hello-deployment-5ff7f68854-wqzp7
Test the /greet-kubernetes path:
curl -v --resolve altostrat.com:443: USER_CLUSTER_INGRESS_VIP https://altostrat.com/greet-kubernetes --cacert root-ca.crt
Output:
Hello Kubernetes!
Cleaning up
Delete your Ingress:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG delete ingress INGRESS_NAME
Replace INGRESS_NAME with the name of the Ingress, such as my-ingress or my-ingress-2 .
Delete your Service:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG delete service hello-service
Delete your Deployment:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG delete deployment hello-deployment
