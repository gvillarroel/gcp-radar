CPU, RAM, and storage requirements (kubeception)
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for an
installation of Google Distributed Cloud with user clusters that use kubeception.
What is kubeception?
The term
kubeception
is used to convey the idea that a Kubernetes cluster is used to create and
manage other Kubernetes clusters. In the context of Google Distributed Cloud,
kubeception refers to the case where the control-plane for a user cluster runs
on one or more nodes in an admin cluster.
We don't recommend using kubeception. Instead, we recommend using
Controlplane V2 .
With Controlplane V2, the control-plane nodes for the user cluster are in the user
cluster itself.
For resource requirements in an installation that uses Controlplane V2, see
CPU, RAM, and storage requirements .
CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for an admin workstation
Before you create an admin workstation, you fill in an
admin workstation configuration file .
In the configuration file, you specify a vSphere
cluster ,
a vSphere
resource pool ,
and a vSphere
datastore .
The vSphere cluster is a set of physical hosts running
ESXi , and
the resource pool has a reservation for a portion of the resources available on
those ESXi hosts.
The resource pool must have enough CPU and RAM to support the requirements
of your admin workstation and any other VMs that belong to the pool. Likewise,
the datastore must have enough storage to support the requirements of your admin
workstation and any other VMs that use the datastore.
The admin workstation has the following requirements:
4 vCPUs (virtual CPUs)
8 GiB of RAM
100 GiB
Google Distributed Cloud supports only x86-64 vCPUs at the CPU microarchitecture
level v3 (x86-64-v3) and higher.
CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for an admin cluster
Before you create an admin cluster, you fill in an
admin cluster configuration file .
In the configuration file, you specify a vSphere cluster, a vSphere resource pool, and
a vSphere datastore
The resource pool must have enough CPU and RAM to support the requirements
of your admin cluster and any other VMs that belong to the pool. Likewise,
the datastore must have enough storage to support the requirements of your admin
cluster and any other VMs that use the datastore.
The admin cluster has one or more associated user clusters. For each associated
user cluster, the admin cluster has one or three nodes. These nodes run the
control-plane components for the user cluster, and they are called user cluster
control-plane nodes.
For a high-availability (HA) user cluster, the admin cluster has three
control-plane nodes. For a non-HA user cluster, the admin cluster has one
control-plane node.
The admin cluster has the following storage requirements:
40 GiB for a VM template
100 GiB to store etcd object data
240 GiB for
Google Cloud Observability to buffer logs and metrics
during a network outage
If Prometheus is enabled, 506 GiB for Prometheus to
store metrics data
For each node, 40 GiB. This includes the nodes that serve as user cluster
control planes.
For each user cluster control-plane node:
An additional 10 GiB to fulfill PVCs created for audit logs
An additional 5 GiB to fulfill PVCs created for etcd object data
An additional 5 GiB to fulfill PVCs created for etcd event data
The following table gives the CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for nodes
in the admin cluster:
Node
Requirements
Purpose
Admin cluster control-plane
2 vCPUs
4 GiB of RAM
40 GiB of storage
Runs the control plane for the admin cluster.
Add-ons
Two VMs, each of which has the following requirements:
4 vCPUs
16 GiB of RAM
40 GiB of storage
Runs add-ons for the admin cluster.
User cluster control plane
For each user cluster, one or three VMs. Each VM has the following
requirements:
3 vCPUs
5 GiB of RAM
60 GiB of storage
Runs the control plane for a user cluster.
* Google Distributed Cloud supports only x86-64 vCPUs at the CPU
microarchitecture level v3 (x86-64-v3) and higher.
CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for a user cluster
Before you create a user cluster, you fill in a
user cluster configuration file .
In the configuration file, you specify a vSphere cluster, a vSphere resource
pool, and a vSphere datastore.
The resource pool must have enough CPU and RAM to support the requirements
of your user cluster and any other VMs that belong to the pool. Likewise,
the datastore must have enough storage to support the requirements of your user
cluster and any other VMs that use the datastore.
A user cluster has the following storage requirements:
For each node, 40 GiB
240 GiB for Google Cloud Observability to buffer logs and metrics during a
network outage
If Prometheus is enabled, 506 GiB for Prometheus to store metrics data
The following table gives default values for CPU, RAM, and storage for each
node in a user cluster. Depending on the needs of your workloads, you might want
to adjust the values. To determine how much CPU and RAM are available on a node
for your workloads, see
Resources available for your workloads .
You can specify values for CPU and RAM in the
nodePools
section of the user cluster configuration file.
Node
Requirements
Purpose
User cluster control plane
For each user cluster, one or three VMs. Each VM has the following
requirements:
3 vCPUs
5 GiB of RAM
60 GiB of storage
Runs the control plane for a user cluster.
Worker node
These are the default values for an individual worker node:
4 vCPUs
8 GiB of RAM
40 GiB of storage
A user cluster node is a virtual machine where your workloads run.
The resources required for your user cluster nodes depend on the workloads
you intend to run.
* Google Distributed Cloud supports only x86-64 vCPUs at the CPU
microarchitecture level v3 (x86-64-v3) and higher.
Example of CPU, RAM, and storage requirements
Suppose you have two vSphere
data
centers :
Data center 1 has a vSphere cluster named Cluster 1, and Cluster 1 has a resource pool
named Resource Pool 1. There are four physical hosts running ESXi in Cluster
1.
Data center 2 has a vSphere cluster named Cluster 2, and Cluster 2 has a
resource pool named Resource Pool 2. There are eight physical hosts running
ESXi in Cluster 2.
You decide that your admin workstation and your admin cluster will be in
Resource Pool 1 and use Datastore 1.
You decide that your user clusters will be in Resource Pool 2 and use
Datastore 2. You don't intend to enable Prometheus in your user
clusters.
You want to create these two user clusters:
A user cluster where you think each worker node will need 6 vCPUs,
16 GiB of RAM, and 40 GiB of storage. This user cluster will
have 20 nodes. You want an HA control plane for this user cluster, so there
will be three nodes in the admin cluster that serve as control planes for
this user cluster. Each user-cluster-control plane node will be configured
with 4 vCPUs and 8 GiB of RAM.
A second user cluster where you think each worker node will need 4 vCPUs,
8 GiB of RAM, and 40 GiB of storage. This user cluster will have
eight nodes. You don't need an HA control plane for this user cluster, so
there will be only one node in the admin cluster that serves as control plane
for this user cluster. The user cluster control-plane node will be configured
with 3 vCPUs and 5 GMiB of RAM.
Requirements for Resource Pool 1 and Datastore 1
Resource Pool 1 has reserved a portion of the CPU and RAM provided by the
four ESXi hosts in Cluster 1. Resource Pool 1 must have enough CPU and RAM to
meet the requirements of the admin workstation and the admin cluster. And
Datastore 1 must have enough storage to meet the requirements of the admin
workstation and the admin cluster.
The admin cluster has its own control-plane node, two nodes for add-ons, three
nodes for the control plane of your first user cluster, and one node for the
control plane of your second user cluster. So the admin cluster has seven nodes.
Recall that the admin workstation has these resource requirements:
Example: Admin workstation requirements
vCPU
4 vCPUs
RAM
8 GiB
Storage
50 GiB
The admin cluster has these resource requirements:
Example: Admin cluster requirements
vCPU
1 admin cluster control-plane node x 2 vCPUs/node +
2 add-on nodes x 4 vCPUs/node +
3 user cluster control-plane nodes x 4 vCPUs/node +
1 user cluster control-plane node x 3 vCPUs/node
25 vCPUs
RAM
1 admin cluster control-plane node x 4 GiB/node +
2 add-on nodes x 16 GiB/node +
3 user cluster control-plane nodes x 8 GiB/node +
1 user cluster control-plane node x 5 GiB/node
65 GiB
Storage
40 GiB for a VM template +
100 GiB for etcd object data +
240 GiB for Google Cloud Observability +
1 admin cluster control-plane node x 40 GiB/node +
2 add-on nodes x 40 GiB/node +
4 user cluster control-plane nodes x 60 GiB/node
740 GiB
The following table gives the total CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for
the admin workstation and admin cluster. Resource Pool 1 and Datastore 1 must be
able to provide these resources:
Example: Total requirements for Resource Pool 1 and
Datastore 1
vCPU
29 vCPUs
RAM
73 GiB
Storage
790 GiB
Requirements for Resource Pool 2 and Datastore 2
Resource Pool 2 has reserved a portion of the CPU and RAM provided by the
eight ESXi hosts in Cluster 2. Resource Pool 2 must have enough CPU and RAM to
meet the requirements of both user clusters. And Datastore 1 must have enough
storage to meet the requirements of both user clusters.
The first user cluster has these resource requirements:
Example: First user cluster requirements
CPU
20 nodes x 6 vCPUs/node
120 vCPUs
RAM
20 nodes x 16 GiB/node
320 GiB
Storage
240 GiB for Google Cloud Observability +
20 nodes x 40 GiB/node
1,040 GiB
The second user cluster has these resource requirements:
Example: Second user cluster requirements
CPU
8 nodes x 4 vCPUs/node
32 vCPUs
RAM
8 nodes x 8 GiB/node
64 GiB
Storage
240 GiB for Google Cloud Observability +
8 nodes x 40 GiB/node
560 GiB
The following table gives the total CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for
the two user clusters. Resource Pool 2 and Datastore 2 must be able to provide
these resources:
Example: Total requirements for Resource Pool 2 and
Datastore 2
CPU
152 vCPUs
RAM
384 GiB
Storage
1,600 GiB
Resource overcommitment
vSphere supports resource overcommitment, for example
memory overcommitment
and
CPU overcommitment .
So the total resources reserved by the resource pools in a cluster can be
greater than the physical resources provided by the ESXi hosts in the cluster.
The requirements given in this document are for reserved virtual resources.
For the minimum CPU, RAM, and storage requirements for a proof-of-concept
demonstration, see
Set up minimal infrastructure .
Monitor resource contention
You should monitor resource contention signals to make sure that your resource
pools and datastores can support your configured virtual resources. For more
information, see
Create a VM health status dashboard .
