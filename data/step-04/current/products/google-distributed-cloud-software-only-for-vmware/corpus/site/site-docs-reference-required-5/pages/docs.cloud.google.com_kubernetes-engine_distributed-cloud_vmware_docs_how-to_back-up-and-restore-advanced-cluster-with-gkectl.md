Back up and restore advanced clusters with gkectl
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes how to back up and restore Google Distributed Cloud version
1.32 and higher admin and user clusters that have
advanced cluster enabled.
The backup and restore feature is in Preview in version 1.32 and GA in
version 1.33 and higher.
Warning: Using a backup file to restore your cluster is a last resort. The
restore process resets the existing cluster and overwrites the cluster
information. We don't recommend restoring from a backup file unless the cluster
has failed catastrophically. Contact Cloud Customer Care for help in deciding
the best course of action.
The gkectl backup and restore process does not include persistent volumes. Any
volumes created by the local volume provisioner (LVP) are left unaltered.
Back up a cluster
The gkectl backup cluster command adds the cluster information from the etcd
store and the PKI certificates for the specified cluster to a tar file. The etcd
store is the Kubernetes backing store for all cluster data and contains all the
Kubernetes objects and custom objects required to manage cluster state. The PKI
certificates are used for authentication over Transport Layer Security (TLS).
This data is backed up from the cluster's control plane or from one of the
control planes for a high-availability (HA) deployment.
The backup tar file contains sensitive credentials, including your service
account keys and the SSH key. Store backup files in a secure location. To
prevent unintended file exposure, the backup process uses in-memory files only.
Back up your clusters regularly to ensure your snapshot data is relatively
current. Adjust the rate of backups to reflect the frequency of significant
changes to your clusters.
Before you begin, ensure your cluster is operating properly, with working
credentials and SSH connectivity to all nodes. The intent of the backup process
is to capture your cluster in a known good state so that you can restore
operation if a catastrophic failure occurs.
To back up a cluster:
Run the following command to check your
cluster:
gkectl diagnose cluster --cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster you plan to back
up.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path of the kubeconfig file for
the admin cluster.
Run the applicable command to back up the cluster:
Admin cluster
gkectl backup admin --kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
User cluster
gkectl backup cluster --cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
By default, the backup tar file is saved to the directory
gkectl-workspace/backups on your admin workstation. The tar file is named
CLUSTER_NAME _backup_ TIMESTAMP .tar.gz ,
where CLUSTER_NAME is the name of the
cluster being backed up and TIMESTAMP is the date and time
the backup was made. For example, if the cluster name is testuser , the backup
file has a name like testuser_backup_2025-08-23T150405Z0700.tar.gz .
Optionally, you can specify a different name and location for your backup file
with the --backup-file flag, for example:
gkectl backup cluster testuser \
--kubeconfig admin-cluster/kubeconfig \
--backup-file cluster-backups/testuser-backup-aug-23-2025.tar.gz
The backup file expires after a year and the cluster restore process doesn't
work with expired backup files.
Backup to vSphere
To configure backups so that the backup file for both admin and user
clusters are uploaded to vSphere in addition to being saved on your admin
workstation, do the following:
Add the
clusterBackup.datastore
field to your admin cluster configuration file:
clusterBackup :
datastore : DATASTORE
Replace DATASTORE with the datastore where you want to
store the backup. The datastore must be in the same datacenter as the admin
cluster. The backups are located in the
anthos/ CLUSTER_NAME /backup directory of the specified
datastore.
Update the admin cluster:
gkectl update admin --kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG \
--config ADMIN_CONFIG
Replace the following:
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path of the kubeconfig file for
the admin cluster.
ADMIN_CONFIG : the path of the admin cluster
configuration file.
By default, the gkectl backup command saves the three most recent backup
files in vSphere and deletes older backup files. If you want to keep the
older backup files, add the flag --keep-all-backups , which is available in
version 1.32.100 and higher.
Restore a cluster
Restoring a cluster from a backup is a last resort and should only be used when
a cluster has failed catastrophically and can't be returned to service any other
way. For example, the etcd data is corrupted or the etcd Pod is in a crash loop.
Use the gkectl restore command only if all three control plane nodes have
failed.
If only one node has failed, and
autoRepair.enabled
is set to true in the admin cluster configuration file, the failed node is
automatically repaired. If autoRepair.enabled isn't configured, add it
to the admin cluster configuration file and run gkectl update admin . After
the update, the node is automatically recreated.
If two control plane nodes have failed, see the
Restore quorum section on this page.
Note: To improve cluster performance, Google Distributed Cloud uses a separate etcd
instance to store Event objects. These Event objects have a time to live (TTL)
of one hour. The cluster restore operation creates a new, empty etcd-events
instance, so you lose existing Event objects. However, the loss of Event objects
has no impact on cluster operation. Events should be treated as informative,
best-effort, supplemental data only.
The backup tar file contains sensitive credentials, including your service
account keys and the SSH key. To prevent unintended file exposure, the
Google Distributed Cloud restore process uses in-memory files only.
Before you restore a cluster, make sure that the following conditions are met:
All control plane node machines that were available for the cluster
at the time of the backup are operating properly and reachable.
SSH connectivity between nodes works with the SSH keys that were
used at the time of the backup. These SSH keys are reinstated as part of the
restore process.
The service-account keys that were used at the time of the
backup are still active. These service-account keys are reinstated for the
restored cluster.
To restore a cluster:
Run the applicable command to restore the cluster:
Admin cluster
gkectl restore admin --backup-file BACKUP_FILE \
--config ADMIN_CONFIG
Replace the following:
BACKUP_FILE : the path and name of the backup file you
are using.
ADMIN_CONFIG : the path to the admin cluster config
file.
User cluster
gkectl restore cluster --cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME \
--backup-file BACKUP_FILE \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster you are
restoring.
BACKUP_FILE : the path and name of the backup file you
are using.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path to the admin cluster
kubeconfig file.
At the end of the restore process, a new kubeconfig file is generated for the
restored cluster at the workspace directory gkectl-workspace .
When the restore finishes, run the following command to verify that it was
successful:
gkectl diagnose cluster --cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME \
--kubeconfig GENERATED_KUBECONFIG
Replace GENERATED_KUBECONFIG with the generated
kubeconfig file.
Restore quorum
When two control plane nodes have failed in a cluster, you can use the
gkectl restore command to restore quorum. When restoring quorum, instead of
specifying the backup file to the gkectl restore command, you specify the IP
address of the working control plane node.
Before running the command, make sure that the following conditions are met:
There is one (and only one) control plane node working.
The working control plane node is accessible with the SSH key. For more
information, see
Using SSH to connect to a cluster node .
To restore quorum, run the applicable command for your cluster type:
Admin cluster
gkectl restore admin --kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG \
--config ADMIN_CONFIG \
--control-plane-node WORKING_NODE_IP \
--ssh-key ADMIN_SSH_KEY_PATH
Replace the following:
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path of the kubeconfig file for
the admin cluster.
ADMIN_CONFIG : the path of the admin cluster
configuration file.
WORKING_NODE_IP : the IP address of the working control
plane node.
ADMIN_SSH_KEY_PATH : the admin cluster SSH key path.
User cluster
gkectl restore cluster --cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME \
--kubeconfig ADMIN_KUBECONFIG \
--control-plane-node WORKING_NODE_IP \
--ssh-key USER_SSH_KEY_PATH
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster you are
restoring.
ADMIN_KUBECONFIG : the path to the admin cluster
kubeconfig file.
WORKING_NODE_IP : the IP address of the working control
plane node.
USER_SSH_KEY_PATH : the user cluster SSH key path.
Troubleshoot
If you have problems with the backup or restore process, the following sections
might help you to troubleshoot the issue.
If you need additional assistance, reach out to the Cloud Customer Care team.
Running out of memory during a backup or restore
If the workstation where you run the gkectl command doesn't have a lot of RAM,
you might have insufficient memory to perform the backup or restore process. If
needed, create and use a temporary scratch disk to process the backup or restore
operations by using the --use-disk parameter in the backup command. To
preserve the file permissions, this parameter modifies permissions of the files,
so it requires that you run the command as a root user (or use sudo ).
Refresh of SSH key after a backup breaks the restore process
SSH-related operations during the restore process might fail if the SSH key is
refreshed after a backup was performed. In this case, the new SSH key becomes
invalid for the restore process. To resolve this issue, you can temporarily add
the original SSH key back, then perform the restore. After the restore process
is complete, you can rotate the SSH key.
