Create a user cluster
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In Google Distributed Cloud, your workloads run on one or more user clusters. This
document shows how to create a user cluster. If you want to
use topology domains, see
Create a user cluster for use with topology domains .
This page is for Admins, Architects, and Operators who set
up, monitor, and manage the tech infrastructure. To learn more about common
roles and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
In version 1.33 and higher, all new clusters are created as
advanced clusters . Be sure to review
Differences when running advanced clusters .
There are several tools that you can use to create a user cluster:
gkectl
Google Cloud console
Google Cloud CLI
Terraform
Three of these tools (the console, the gcloud CLI, and
Terraform) are clients of the
GKE On-Prem API .
For guidance on which tool you might like to use, see
Choose a tool to manage cluster lifecycle .
Before you begin
If you plan to use gkectl to create the user cluster, make sure you have
set up and can sign in to your admin workstation as described in
Create an admin workstation .
Make sure that your admin workstation has the required version of gkectl .
Typically, you use the same version of gkectl as the version that will be
used when you create the cluster. You specify the cluster version in the
gkeOnPremVersion field in the cluster configuration file. The following
version rules are enforced during cluster creation:
The gkectl minor version can't be lower than the minor version for the
cluster. For example, creating a 1.30 cluster using gkectl version 1.29
isn't allowed. Patch versions don't matter. For example, you can use
gkectl version 1.29.0-gke.1456 to create a cluster with a higher patch
version, such as 1.29.1000-gke.94.
The gkectl minor version can't be more than two minor versions
higher than the cluster version. For example, if you are creating a 1.28
cluster, the gkectl version can be 1.29 or 1.30. But you can't use
gkectl version 1.31 because that is three minor versions higher than the
cluster version.
If needed, see Download gkectl to
get a supported version of gkectl .
If you haven't already done so, set up your Google Cloud resources as
described in these documents:
Install the Google Cloud CLI
Create Cloud projects
Create service accounts
As you set up your
fleet host project ,
keep in mind your choice of tool, because if you have chosen one of the
GKE On-Prem API clients, there are additional APIs that you must enable.
For the list of APIs, see
Enable APIs in your fleet host project .
Before you create a user cluster, you must have an admin cluster to manage
the user cluster. If you haven't already done so, create an
admin workstation
and an admin cluster .
Determine the version of the user cluster that you want to install. When you
create a user cluster, you typically install the version that matches
the version of the admin cluster. If you want to install a different
version on a user cluster, see
Version rules .
If you plan to install version 1.30 or a higher version, Controlplane V2 is
required. Even if you are installing 1.29 or lower, we recommend that you
enable Controlplane V2. When Controlplane V2 is enabled, the control plane
for the user cluster runs on one or more nodes in the user cluster itself.
The alternative is to create a user cluster that uses kubeception . In the
kubeception case, the control plane for the user cluster runs on one or more
nodes in the admin cluster.
Review the
IP addresses planning document ,
and ensure that you have enough IP addresses available.
Review the load balancing overview
and revisit your decision about the kind of load balancer you want to use.
You can use the bundled MetalLB load balancer, or you can manually configure
a load balancer of your choice. For manual load balancing, you must set up
the load balancer before you create your user cluster.
Think about how many
node pools
you need and which operating system you want to run in each of your pools.
Think about whether you want to use separate
vSphere clusters
for your admin cluster and user clusters, and whether you want to use separate
data centers .
Also think about whether you want to use separate instances of
vCenter Server .
In version 1.29 and higher, server-side preflight checks are enabled by
default. Server-side preflight checks require additional firewall rules. In
Firewall rules for admin clusters ,
search for "Preflight checks" and make sure all required firewall rules are
configured.
With server-side preflight checks, when you create a user cluster using
gkectl , the preflight checks are run on the admin cluster instead of
locally on the admin workstation. Server-side preflight checks are also run
if you use the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, or Terraform to create
a user cluster.
Create a user cluster with the tool of your choice
This section provides steps for creating a user cluster using gkectl , the
console, the gcloud CLI, and Terraform.
gkectl
Procedure overview
These are the primary steps involved in using gkectl to create a user cluster:
Fill in your configuration files
Specify the details for your new cluster by completing a user cluster
configuration file, a credentials configuration file, and possibly an IP block
file.
(Optional) Import OS images to vSphere, and push container images to the private registry if applicable.
Run gkectl prepare .
Create a user cluster
Run gkectl create cluster to create a cluster as specified in your
configuration file.
Verify that your user cluster is running
Use kubectl to view your cluster nodes.
At the end of this procedure, you will have a running user cluster where you
can deploy your workloads.
If you use VPC Service Controls, you might see errors when you run some
gkectl commands, such as "Validation Category: GCP - [UNKNOWN] GCP
service: [Stackdriver] could not get GCP services" . To avoid these errors, add
the --skip-validation-gcp parameter to your commands.
Fill in your configuration files
If you used gkeadm to create your admin workstation, then gkeadm generated
a template for your user cluster configuration file named user-cluster.yaml .
Additionally, gkeadm filled in some of the fields for you.
If you didn't use gkeadm to create your admin workstation, you can use
gkectl to generate a template for your user cluster configuration file.
To generate a template for your user cluster configuration file:
gkectl create-config cluster --config= OUTPUT_FILENAME --gke-on-prem-version= VERSION
Replace the following:
OUTPUT_FILENAME : a path of your choice for the
generated template. If you omit this flag, gkectl names the file
user-cluster.yaml and puts it in the current directory.
VERSION : the desired version number. For example:
gkectl create-config cluster --gke-on-prem-version=1.34.200-gke.68 .
Familiarize yourself with the configuration file by scanning the
user cluster configuration file
document. You might want to keep this document open in a separate tab or window,
because you will refer to it as you complete the following steps.
name
Set the
name
field to a name of your choice for the user cluster.
gkeOnPremVersion
This field is already filled in for you. It specifies the version of
Google Distributed Cloud. For example, 1.34.200-gke.68 .
enableAdvancedCluster
In version 1.31, if you want to enable the advanced cluster feature, set
enableAdvancedCluster
to true . This field must be set to true if the admin cluster has
advanced cluster enabled .
Note the following differences between versions:
In version 1.31, the advanced cluster feature is in preview:
You can enable advanced cluster at cluster creation time for new 1.31
clusters only.
After advanced cluster is enabled, you won't be able to upgrade the cluster
to 1.32. Only enable advanced cluster in a test environment.
In version 1.32, the advanced cluster feature is GA.
By default, user clusters are created as advanced clusters. You have to
explicitly set enableAdvancedCluster to false if you want to create a
non-advanced cluster.
For clusters that have the advanced clusters feature enabled, cluster
upgrades are supported.
In version 1.33 and higher, all clusters are created as advanced clusters. If
you set enableAdvancedCluster to false , cluster creation fails.
enableControlplaneV2
To create a user cluster that has Controlplane V2 enabled, set
enableControlplaneV2
to true .
If you enable advanced cluster ,
then you must set enableControlplaneV2 to true .
When Controlplane V2 is enabled, the control plane for the user cluster runs on
nodes in the user cluster itself. We strongly recommend that you enable
Controlplane V2.
kubeception
If you set this field to false , the cluster will use
kubecetption .
With kubeception, the control plane for the user cluster runs on nodes in the
admin cluster.
For a kubeception cluster:
Set enableControlplaneV2 to false .
Don't fill in the controlPlaneIPBlock section.
Specify IP addresses for the control-plane nodes of the user cluster in the
IP block file of the admin cluster.
enableDataplaneV2
Set
enableDataplaneV2
to true .
vCenter
The values you set in the vCenter section of your
admin cluster configuration file
are global. That is, they apply to your admin cluster and its associated user
clusters.
For each user cluster that you create, you have the option of overriding some of
the global vCenter values.
To override any of the global vCenter values, fill in the relevant
fields in the
vCenter
section of your user cluster configuration file.
In particular, you might want to use separate vSphere clusters for your admin
cluster and user clusters, and you might want to use separate data centers for
your admin cluster and user clusters.
Using one data center and one vSphere cluster
The default option is to use one data center and one vSphere cluster for the
admin cluster and the user cluster. For this option, don't set any
vCenter values in the user cluster configuration file. The vCenter values
will be inherited from the admin cluster.
Using separate vSphere clusters
If you want to create a user cluster that is in its own vSphere cluster,
specify a value for vCenter.cluster in the user cluster configuration file.
If your admin cluster and user cluster are in separate vSphere clusters, they
can be in the same data center or different data centers.
Using separate vSphere data centers
The user cluster and admin cluster can be in different
data centers .
In that case, they are also in separate vSphere clusters.
If you specify vCenter.datacenter in the user cluster configuration file, then
you must also specify:
vCenter.networkName
Either vCenter.datastore or vCenter.storagePolicyName
Either vCenter.cluster or vCenter.resourcePool
Using separate vCenter accounts
A user cluster can use a different vCenter account, with different
vCenter.credentials , from the admin cluster. The vCenter account for the
admin cluster needs access to the admin cluster data center, while the vCenter
account for the user cluster only needs access to the user cluster data center.
Using separate instances of vCenter Server
In certain situations, it makes sense to create a user cluster that uses its own
instance of vCenter Server. That is, the admin cluster and an associated user
cluster use different instances of vCenter Server.
For example, in an edge location, you might want to have a physical machine
running vCenter Server and one or more physical machines running ESXi. You could
then use your local instance of vCenter Server to create a vSphere object
hierarchy, including data centers, clusters, resource pools, datastores,
and folders.
Fill in the entire
vCenter
section of your user cluster configuration file. In particular, specify a value
for vCenter.address that is different from the vCenter Server address you
specified in the admin cluster configuration file. For example:
vCenter:
address: "vc-edge.example"
datacenter: "vc-edge"
cluster: "vc-edge-workloads"
resourcePool: "vc-edge-pool
datastore: "vc-edge-datastore
caCertPath: "/usr/local/google/home/me/certs/edge-cacert.pem"
credentials:
fileRef:
path: "credential.yaml"
entry: "vCenter-edge"
folder: "edge-vm-folder"
Also fill in the
network.vCenter.networkName
field.
network
Decide how you want your worker nodes to get their IP addresses. The options
are:
From a DHCP server that you set up ahead of time. Set network.ipMode.type
to "dhcp" .
From a list of static IP addresses that you provide. Set network.ipMode.type
to "static" , and create an
IP block file
that provides the static IP addresses. For an example of an IP block file,
see
Example of filled-in configuration files .
If you have decided to use static IP addresses for your worker nodes, fill in the
network.ipMode.ipBlockFilePath
field.
The control-plane nodes for your user cluster must get their IP addresses from a
list of static addresses that you provide. This is the case even if your worker
nodes get their addresses from a DHCP server. To specify static IP addresses for
your control-plane nodes, fill in the
network.controlPlaneIPBlock
section. If you want a high-availability (HA) user cluster, specify three IP
addresses. Otherwise, specify one IP address.
Specify DNS and NTP servers by filling in the hostConfig section. These DNS
and NTP servers are for the control-plane nodes. If you are using static IP
addresses for your worker nodes, then these DNS and NTP servers are also for the
worker nodes.
The
network.podCIDR
and
network.serviceCIDR
have prepopulated values that you can leave unchanged unless they conflict
with addresses already being used in your network. Kubernetes uses these
ranges to assign IP addresses to Pods and Services in your cluster.
Regardless of whether you rely on a DHCP server or specify a list of static IP
addresses, you need to have enough IP addresses available for your user cluster.
For an explanation of how many IP addresses you need, see
Plan your IP addresses .
loadBalancer
Set aside a VIP for the Kubernetes API server of your user cluster. Set aside
another VIP for the ingress service of your user cluster. Provide your VIPs as
values for
loadBalancer.vips.controlPlaneVIP
and
loadBalancer.vips.ingressVIP .
Decide what type of load balancing you want to use. The options are:
MetalLB bundled load balancing. Set
loadBalancer.kind
to "MetalLB" . Also fill in the
loadBalancer.metalLB.addressPools
section, and set enableLoadBalancer to true for at least one of your node
pools. For more information, see
Bundled load balancing with MetalLB .
Manual load balancing. Set loadBalancer.kind to "ManualLB" , and fill in
the
manualLB
section. For more information, see
Manual load balancing .
For more information about load balancing options, see
Overview of load balancing .
advancedNetworking
If you plan to create an
egress NAT gateway , set
advancedNetworking
to true .
multipleNetworkInterfaces
Decide whether you want to configure
multiple network interfaces
for Pods, and set
multipleNetworkInterfaces
accordingly.
storage
If you want to disable the deployment of vSphere CSI components, set
storage.vSphereCSIDisabled
to true .
masterNode
In the
masterNode
section, you can specify how many control-plane nodes you want for your user
cluster: specify 3 for a highly-available (HA) cluster or 1 for a non-HA
cluster. You can also specify a datastore for the control-plane nodes and
whether you want to enable automatic resizing for the control-plane nodes.
If the
enableAdvancedCluster
field is true , you must set the replicas field to 3 . Only HA user clusters
are supported on advanced clusters.
Recall that you specified IP addresses for the control-plane nodes in the
network.controlPlaneIPBlock
section.
nodePools
A node pool is a group of nodes in a cluster that all have the same
configuration. For example, the nodes in one pool could run Windows and the
nodes in another pool could run Linux.
You must specify at least one node pool by filling in the
nodePools
section.
If you enable advanced cluster, set nodePools[i]osImageType to either
ubuntu_cgroupv2 or ubuntu_containerd .
For more information, see
Node pools and
Creating and managing node pools .
antiAffinityGroups
Set
antiAffinityGroups.enabled
to true or false .
This field specifies whether Google Distributed Cloud creates
Distributed Resource Scheduler
(DRS) anti-affinity rules for your worker nodes, causing them to be
spread across at least three physical hosts in your data center.
stackdriver
If you want to enable
Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring
for your cluster, fill in the
stackdriver
section.
This section is required by default. That is, if you don't fill in this section,
you must include the --skip-validation-stackdriver flag when you run
gkectl create cluster .
Note the following requirements for new clusters:
The ID in stackdriver.projectID must be the same as the ID
in gkeConnect.projectID and cloudAuditLogging.projectID .
The Google Cloud region set in stackdriver.clusterLocation must be the same
as the region set in cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation and
gkeConnect.location . Additionally, if gkeOnPremAPI.enabled is true , the
same region must be set in gkeOnPremAPI.location .
If the project IDs and regions aren't the same, cluster creation fails.
gkeConnect
Your user cluster must be
registered to a Google Cloud fleet .
Fill in the
gkeConnect
section to specify a
fleet host project
and an associated service account. The ID in gkeConnect.projectID must be the
same as the ID set in stackdriver.projectID and
cloudAuditLogging.projectID . If the project IDs aren't the same, cluster creation
fails.
In 1.28 and later, you can optionally specify a region where the Fleet and
Connect services run in gkeConnect.location . If you don't include this field,
the cluster uses the global instances of these services.
Important: If you plan to install Cloud Service Mesh on a regional cluster, you
must install version 1.19.3 or later.
If you include gkeConnect.location in your configuration file, the region
that you specify must be the same as the region configured in
cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation , stackdriver.clusterLocation , and
gkeOnPremAPI.location . If the regions aren't the same, cluster creation fails.
gkeOnPremAPI
In 1.16 and later, if the GKE On-Prem API is enabled in your
Google Cloud project, all clusters in the project are
enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API
automatically in the region configured in stackdriver.clusterLocation .
The gkeOnPremAPI.location region must be the same as the region specified in
cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation , gkeConnect.location (if the field is
included in your configuration file), and stackdriver.clusterLocation .
If you want to enroll all clusters in the project in the GKE On-Prem API,
be sure to do the steps in
Before you begin to
activate and use the GKE On-Prem API in the project.
If you don't want to enroll the cluster in the GKE On-Prem API, include
this section and set gkeOnPremAPI.enabled to false . If you don't
want to enroll any clusters in the project, disable
gkeonprem.googleapis.com (the service name for the GKE On-Prem API)
in the project. For instructions, see
Disabling services .
cloudAuditLogging
If you want to integrate the audit logs from your cluster's Kubernetes API
server with
Cloud Audit Logs , fill in the
cloudAuditLogging
section.
Note the following requirements:
If you enable advanced cluster, set cloudAuditLogging.serviceAccountKeyPath
to the same path as stackdriver.serviceAccountKeyPath .
The ID in cloudAuditLogging.projectID must be the same as the ID
in gkeConnect.projectID and stackdriver.projectID .
The region in cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation must be the same as the
region set in gkeConnect.location and stackdriver.clusterLocation .
Additionally, if gkeOnPremAPI.enabled is true , the same region must be set
in gkeOnPremAPI.location .
If the project IDs and regions aren't the same, cluster creation fails.
Example of filled-in configuration files
Here is an example of an IP block file and a user cluster configuration file;
user-ipblock.yaml
blocks:
- netmask: 255.255.255.0

clusterLocation: "us-central1"
enableVPC: false
serviceAccountKeyPath: "log-mon-sa-2203040617.json"
autoRepair:
enabled: true
These are the important points to understand in the preceding example:
The nodePools.replicas field is set to 3 , which means there are three
worker nodes in "worker-node-pool" . All worker nodes use static IP
addresses because network.ipMode.type is set to "static" .
The static IP addresses for the worker nodes are specified in an IP block
file. The IP block file has four addresses even though there are only three
worker nodes. The extra IP address is needed during cluster upgrade, update,
and auto repair.
DNS and NTP servers are specified in the hostConfig section. In this
example, these DNS and NTP servers are for the control-plane nodes and the
worker nodes. That is because the worker nodes have static IP addresses. If
the worker nodes were to get their IP addresses from a DHCP server, then these
DNS and NTP servers would be only for the control-plane nodes.
The static IP addresses for the three control-plane nodes are specified in the
network.controlPlaneIPBlock section of the user cluster configuration file.
There is no need for an extra IP address in this block.
Controlplane V2 is enabled.
The masterNode.replicas field is set to 3 , so the cluster will have a
high-availability control plane.
The control-plane VIP and the ingress VIP are both in the same VLAN as the
worker nodes and the control-plane nodes.
The VIPs that are set aside for Services of type LoadBalancer are specified in
the loadBalancer.metalLB.addressPools section of the user cluster
configuration file. These VIPs are in the same VLAN as the worker nodes and
the control-plane nodes. The set of VIPs specified in this section must
include the ingress VIP and must not include the control-plane VIP.
The user cluster configuration file does not include a vCenter section. So
the user cluster uses the same vSphere resources as the admin cluster.
Validate your configuration file
After you've filled in your user cluster configuration file, run the
gkectl check-config command to verify that the file is valid. Support for the
gkectl check-config command on advanced user clusters was added in the
following versions: 1.32.700+, 1.33.300+, and 1.34.0 and higher. If you are
installing a lower version on an advanced cluster, the command will fail.
gkectl check-config --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG --config USER_CLUSTER_CONFIG
Replace the following:
ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG : the path of the kubeconfig file for
your admin cluster
USER_CLUSTER_CONFIG : the path of your user cluster configuration
file
If the command returns any failure messages, fix the issues and validate the
file again.
If you want to skip the more time-consuming validations, pass the --fast flag.
To skip individual validations, use the --skip-validation-xxx flags. To
learn more about the check-config command, see
Running preflight checks .
(Optional) Import OS images to vSphere, and push container images to a private registry
Run gkectl prepare if any of the following are true:
Your user cluster is in a different vSphere data center from your admin
cluster.
Your user cluster has a different vCenter Server from your admin cluster.
Your user cluster has a different vCenter folder from your admin cluster.
Your user cluster uses a private container registry that is different from the
private registry used by your admin cluster.
gkectl prepare --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
--bundle-path BUNDLE \
--user-cluster-config USER_CLUSTER_CONFIG
Replace the following:
ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG : the path of your admin cluster kubeconfig
file
BUNDLE : the path of the bundle file. This file is on your admin
workstation in /var/lib/gke/bundles/ . For example:
/var/lib/gke/bundles/gke-onprem-vsphere-1.34.200-gke.68-full.tgz
USER_CLUSTER_CONFIG : the path of your user cluster configuration
file
Create a user cluster
Run the following command to create a user cluster:
gkectl create cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG --config USER_CLUSTER_CONFIG
If you use VPC Service Controls, you might see errors when you run some
gkectl commands, such as "Validation Category: GCP - [UNKNOWN] GCP
service: [Stackdriver] could not get GCP services" . To avoid these errors, add
the --skip-validation-gcp parameter to your commands.
Locate the user cluster kubeconfig file
The gkectl create cluster command creates a kubeconfig file named
USER_CLUSTER_NAME-kubeconfig in the current directory. You will need this
kubeconfig file later to interact with your user cluster.
The kubeconfig file contains the name of your user cluster. To view the cluster
name, you can run:
kubectl config get-clusters --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
The output shows the name of the cluster. For example:
NAME
my-user-cluster
If you like, you can change the name and location of your kubeconfig file.
Verify that your user cluster is running
Verify that your user cluster is running:
kubectl get nodes --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
Replace USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG with the path of your user cluster
kubeconfig file.
The output shows the user cluster nodes. For example:
cp-vm-1 Ready control-plane,master 18m
cp-vm-2 Ready control-plane,master 18m
cp-vm-3 Ready control-plane,master 18m
worker-vm-1 Ready 6m7s
worker-vm-2 Ready 6m6s
worker-vm-3 Ready 6m14s

Go to Create VM cluster
Select the Google Cloud project that you want to create the cluster in.
The selected project is used as the fleet host project. This must be
the same project that the admin cluster is registered to. After the user
cluster is created, it is automatically registered to the selected
project's fleet.
In the Choose your cluster type section, select Create a user cluster
for an existing admin cluster .
Cluster basics
Enter basic information about the cluster.
Enter a Name for the user cluster.
Under Admin cluster , select the admin cluster from the
list. If you didn't specify a name for the admin cluster when you created
it, the name is generated in the form gke-admin-[HASH] . If you don't
recognize the admin cluster name, run the following command on your
admin workstation:
KUBECONFIG = ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
kubectl get OnPremAdminCluster -n kube-system -o = jsonpath = '{.items[0].metadata.name}'
If the admin cluster that you want to use isn't displayed, see the
troubleshooting section
The admin cluster isn't displayed on the Cluster basics drop-down list .
In the GCP API Location field, select the Google Cloud region from
the list. This setting specifies the region where the following
APIs and services run:
GKE On-Prem API ( gkeonprem.googleapis.com )
Fleet service ( gkehub.googleapis.com )
Connect service ( gkeconnect.googleapis.com )
This setting also controls the region in which the following are stored:
The user cluster metadata that the GKE On-Prem API needs
to manage the cluster lifecycle
The Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring data of system components
The Admin Audit log created by Cloud Audit Logs
The cluster name, project, and location together uniquely identify the
cluster in Google Cloud.
Select the Google Distributed Cloud version for your user cluster.
As the cluster creator, you are granted cluster admin privileges to the
cluster. Optionally, enter the email address of another user who will
administer the cluster in the Cluster admin user field in the
Authorization section.
When the cluster is created, the GKE On-Prem API applies the Kubernetes
role-based access control (RBAC) policies to the cluster to grant you and
other admin users the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin role, which
provides full access to every resource in the cluster in all namespaces.
Note: In addition to the Kubernetes RBAC policies, you must grant some
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to the users who aren't project owners. For
details on granting the IAM roles, see
Grant required roles .
Click Next to go to the Control plane section.
Control Plane
All the fields in the Control plane section are set with default values.
Review the defaults and optionally, change them as needed.
In the Control-plane node vCPUs field, enter the number of vCPUs
(minimum 4) for each control plane node for your user cluster.
In the Control-plane node memory field, enter the memory size in MiB
(minimum 8192 and must be a multiple of 4) for each control plane for your
user cluster.
Under Control-plane nodes , select the number of
control-plane nodes for your user cluster. For example, you may select 1
control-plane node for a development environment and 3 control-planes
nodes for high availability (HA), production environments.
Optionally, select Automatic node resizing . Resizing means that the
vCPU and memory resources assigned to a node are adjusted automatically.
When enabled, the control-plane nodes for the user cluster are resized
according to the number of worker nodes in the user cluster. So as you add
more worker nodes to the user cluster, the control-plane nodes are
increased in size.
In the Control plane node IPs section, enter the IP addresses for the
gateway, the subnet mask, and the control-plane nodes.
Click Next to go to the Networking section.
Networking
In this section, you specify the IP addresses for your cluster's nodes, Pods,
and Services. A user cluster needs to have one IP address for each node and an
additional IP address for a temporary node that is needed during cluster
upgrades, updates, and auto repair. For more information, see
How many IP addresses does a user cluster need? .
In the Node IPs section, select the IP mode for the user cluster.
Select one of the following:
DHCP : Choose DHCP if you want your cluster nodes to get their IP
address from a DHCP server.
Static : Choose Static if you want to provide static IP addresses
for your cluster nodes, or if you want to set up manual load-balancing.
If you selected DHCP , skip to the next step to specify
Service and Pod CIDRs . For Static IP mode , provide the following
information:
Enter the IP address of the Gateway for the user cluster.
Enter the Subnet mask for the user cluster nodes.
In the IP Addresses section, enter the IP addresses and optionally,
the hostnames for the nodes in the user cluster. You can enter either an
individual IP v4 address (such as 192.0.2.1) or a
CIDR
block of IPv4 addresses (such as 192.0.2.0/24).
If you enter a CIDR block, don't enter a hostname.
If you enter an individual IP address, you can optionally enter a
hostname. If you don't enter a hostname, Google Distributed Cloud uses the
VM's name from vSphere as the hostname.
Click + Add IP Address as needed to enter more IP addresses.
In the Service and Pod CIDRs section, the console provides the following
address ranges for your Kubernetes Services and Pods:
Service CIDR : 10.96.0.0/20
Pod CIDR : 192.168.0.0/16
If you prefer to enter your own address ranges, see
IP addresses for Pods and Services
for best practices.
If you selected Static IP mode or Enable control plane v2 , specify
the following information in the Host config section:
Enter the IP addresses of the DNS servers.
Enter the IP addresses of the NTP servers.
Optionally, enter DNS search domains.
Click Next to go to the Load balancer section.
Load balancer
Choose the load balancer to set up for your cluster. See
Load balancer overview
for more information.
Select the Load balancer type from the list.
Bundled with MetalLB
Configure bundled load balancing with MetalLB. You can use MetalLB for the
user cluster only if your admin cluster is using SeeSaw or MetalLB. This
option requires minimal configuration. MetalLB runs directly on your
cluster nodes and doesn't require extra VMs. For more information about
the benefits of using MetalLB and how it compares to the other load
balancing options, see
Bundled load balancing with MetalLB .
In the Address pools section, configure at least one address pool,
as follows:
Enter a name for the address pool.
Enter an IP address range that contains the ingress VIP in either
CIDR notation (ex. 192.0.2.0/26) or range notation
(ex. 192.0.2.64-192.0.2.72). To specify a single IP address in a pool,
use /32 in the CIDR notation (ex. 192.0.2.1/32).
If the IP addresses for your Services of type LoadBalancer aren't
in the same IP address range as the ingress VIP, click
+ Add IP Address Range and enter another address range.
The IP addresses in each pool cannot overlap, and must be in the same
subnet as the cluster nodes.
Under Assignment of IP addresses , select one of the following:
Automatic : Choose this option if you want the MetalLB controller to
automatically assign IP addresses from the address pool to Services
of type LoadBalancer
Manual : Choose this option if you intend to use addresses from
the pool to manually specify addresses for Services of type
LoadBalancer
Click Avoid buggy IP addresses if you want the MetalLB controller
to not use addresses from the pool that end in .0 or .255. This avoids
the problem of buggy consumer devices mistakenly dropping traffic sent
to those special IP addresses.
When you're finished click Done .
If needed, click Add Address Pool .
In the Virtual IPs section, enter the following:
Control plane VIP : The destination IP address to be used for traffic
sent to the
Kubernetes API server
of the user cluster. The Kubernetes API server for the user cluster
runs on a node in the admin cluster. This IP address must be in the same
L2 domain as the admin cluster nodes. Don't add this address in the
Address pools section.
Ingress VIP : The IP address to be configured on the load balancer
for the ingress proxy. You must add this to an address pool in the
Address pools section.
Click Continue .
F5 BIG-IP
You can use F5 BIG-IP for the user cluster only if your admin cluster is using
F5 BIG-IP. Be sure to install and configure the F5 BIG-IP ADC before integrating
it with Google Distributed Cloud.
The F5 username and password are inherited from the
admin cluster.
In the Virtual IPs section, enter the following:
Control plane VIP : The destination IP address to be used for traffic
sent to the
Kubernetes API server .
Ingress VIP : The IP address to be configured on the load balancer
for the ingress proxy.
In the Address field, enter the address of your F5 BIG-IP load balancer.
In the Partition field, enter the name of a BIG-IP partition that you
created for your user cluster.
In the sNAT pool name field, enter the name of your SNAT pool, if
applicable.
Click Continue .
Manual
You can use a manual load balancer for
the user cluster only if your admin cluster uses a manual load balancer.
In Google Distributed Cloud, the Kubernetes API server and the ingress proxy
are each exposed by a Kubernetes
Service of type LoadBalancer . Choose your own nodePort values in the
30000 - 32767 range for these Services. For the ingress proxy, choose a
nodePort value for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. See
Enabling manual load balancing mode
for more information.
In the Virtual IPs section, enter the following:
Control plane VIP : The destination IP address to be used for traffic
sent to the
Kubernetes API server .
Ingress VIP : The IP address to be configured on the load balancer
for the ingress proxy.
In the Control-plan node port field, enter a nodePort value for
the Kubernetes API server.
In the Ingress HTTP node port field, enter a nodePort value for
HTTP traffic to the ingress proxy.
In the Ingress HTTPS node port field, enter a nodePort value for
HTTPS traffic to the ingress proxy.
In the Konnectivity server node port field, enter a nodePort value
for the Konnectivity server.
Click Continue .
Features
This section displays the features and operations that are enabled on the
cluster.
The following are enabled automatically and can't be disabled:
Cloud Logging of system services
Cloud Monitoring of system services
The Admin Activity audit log
The following are enabled by default, but you can disable them:
Enable vSphere CSI driver : Also called the vSphere Container Storage
Plug-in. The Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver runs in a
Kubernetes cluster deployed in vSphere to provision persistent volumes on
vSphere storage. For more information, see
Using the vSphere Container Storage Interface driver .
Enable anti-affinity groups : VMware Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS)
anti-affinity rules are automatically created for your user cluster's nodes,
causing them to be spread across at least 3 physical hosts in your data
center. Make sure that your vSphere environment meets the
requirements .
Note: If you followed
Set up minimal infrastructure ,
you only have one ESXi host, so be sure to clear
Enable anti-affinity groups .
Click Next to configure a node pool
Node pools
Your cluster will be created with at least one node pool. A node pool is a
template for a group of worker nodes created in this cluster. For more information,
see Creating and managing node pools .
In the Node pool defaults section, complete the following:
Enter the Node pool name or accept "default-pool" as the name.
Enter the number of vCPUs for each node in the pool (minimum
4 per user cluster worker).
Enter the memory size in mebibytes (MiB) for each node in the pool
(minimum 8192 MiB per user cluster worker node and must be a multiple of
4).
In the Nodes field, enter the number of nodes in the pool
(minimum of 3). If you entered static IP addresses for the Node IPs
in the Networking section, make sure that you entered enough IP
addresses to accommodate these user cluster nodes.
Select the OS image type : Ubuntu , Ubuntu Containerd ,
or COS .
Enter the Boot disk size in gibibytes (GiB) (minimum 40 GiB).
If you are using MetalLB as the load balancer, MetalLB must be enabled
in at least one node pool. Either leave Use this node pool for
MetalLB load balancing selected, or add another node pool to use for
MetalLB.
In the Node pool metadata (optional) section, if you want to add
Kubernetes
labels
and
taints ,
do the following:
Click + Add Kubernetes Labels . Enter the Key and
Value for the label. Repeat as needed.
Click + Add Taint . Enter the Key , Value , and
Effect for the taint. Repeat as needed.
Click Verify and Complete to create the user cluster. It takes 15
minutes or more to create the user cluster. The console displays status
messages as it verifies the settings and creates the cluster in your data
center.
If an error is encountered verifying the settings, the console displays an error
message that should be clear enough for you to fix the configuration issue and
try again to create the cluster.
For more information about possible errors and how to fix them, see
Troubleshoot user cluster creation in the Google Cloud console .
gcloud CLI
You use the following command to create a user cluster:
gcloud container vmware clusters create
After creating the cluster, you need to create at least one node pool using
the following command:
gcloud container vmware node-pools create
Most of the flags for creating the cluster and the node pool
correspond to the fields in the
user cluster configuration file .
To help you get started, you can test a complete command in the
examples section.
Gather information
Gather some information that you need to create the cluster.
Get the name and the fleet membership location of your admin cluster:
gcloud container fleet memberships list \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID
Replace FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID with ID of the
project that the admin cluster is registered to.
The output is similar to the following:
NAME EXTERNAL_ID LOCATION
admin-cluster-1 bb7803b4-8438-4b22-859f-4559b4b29072 global
admin-cluster-2 ee16ee2b-6ec0-49fc-9413-3c89cbc70854 global
admin-cluster-3 fc2b7ef5-39ff-4b63-b919-04c5adc67be4 us-west1
The location specifies where the Fleet and Connect services run. Admin
clusters created prior to 1.28 are managed by the global Fleet and
Connect services. In 1.28 and higher, you can specify either global or
a Google Cloud region when you create the admin cluster. You specify the
region in the --admin-cluster-membership-location flag in the example
commands that follow.
Get a list of available versions:
gcloud container vmware clusters query-version-config \
--admin-cluster-membership= ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--admin-cluster-membership-project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--admin-cluster-membership-location= ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION \
--location= REGION
Replace the following:
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the admin cluster.
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project that
the admin cluster is registered to.
ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION : The admin cluster's
fleet membership region. This is either global or a Google Cloud
region. Use the location for the admin cluster from the output
of gcloud container fleet memberships list .
REGION : The Google Cloud region that you
will use when you create the user cluster. This is the region that
the GKE On-Prem API runs and stores its metadata.
If the admin cluster is
enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API ,
use the same region as the admin cluster. To find out the admin
cluster's region, run the following command:
gcloud container vmware admin-clusters list \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location=-
If the admin cluster isn't enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API, specify
us-west1 or another
supported region .
If you subsequently enroll the admin cluster in the GKE On-Prem API,
use the same region that the user cluster is in.
The output of the gcloud container vmware clusters query-version-config
command is similar to the following:
versions:
- isInstalled: true
version: 1.28.800-gke.109
- version: 1.29.0-gke.1456
- version: 1.29.100-gke.248
- version: 1.29.200-gke.245
- version: 1.29.300-gke.184
The command also outputs an explanation of the versions that you can use for
user cluster creation or upgrade. Allowable versions are annotated with
isInstalled: true , which means the admin cluster has the version-specific
components it needs to manage user clusters of that version. If you want to
use a version that is installed on the admin cluster, skip to the
Examples section to create the user cluster.
Install a different version
An admin cluster can manage user clusters at different versions. The output
of the query-version-config command lists other versions that you can use
when you create the cluster. If you want to create a user cluster that is a
different version than the admin cluster, you need to download and deploy the
components that the admin cluster needs to manage user clusters of that version,
as follows:
gcloud container vmware admin-clusters update ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION \
--required-platform-version= VERSION
Replace VERSION with one of the versions listed in the
output of the query-version-config command.
The command downloads the version of the components that you specify in
--required-platform-version to the admin cluster, and then deploys the
the components. You can now create a user cluster with the specified
version.
If you rerun the gcloud container vmware clusters query-version-config ,
the version that you specified is annotated with isInstalled: true .
Examples
The following examples show how to create a user cluster with different load
balancers with Controlplane V2 enabled. With Controlplane V2, the control plane
for a user cluster runs on one or more nodes in the user cluster itself. We
recommend that you enable Controlplane V2, and in version 1.30 and higher,
new user clusters are required to have Controlplane V2 enabled. For information
about the available load balancing options, see
Load balancer overview .
Most of the examples use the default values for configuring the control plane
nodes. If you want to change any of the defaults, include the flags described
in the Control plane flags section. If needed, you can
also change some vSphere settings .
Before running the gcloud command to create the cluster, you can
include --validate-only to validate the configuration that you specified in
the flags to the gcloud command. When you are ready to create the cluster,
remove this flag and run the command.
If you get an error after the gcloud container vmware clusters create command
has been running for about a minute or more, check if the cluster was partially
created by running the following command:
gcloud container vmware clusters list \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location=-
If the cluster isn't listed in the output, fix the error and rerun
gcloud container vmware clusters create .
If the cluster is listed in the output, delete the cluster using
the following command:
gcloud container vmware clusters delete USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION \
--force \
--allow-missing
Then fix the error and rerun gcloud container vmware clusters create .
After the cluster is running, you must add a node pool before deploying
workloads, as described in the Create a node pool
section.
MetalLB & DHCP
This example shows how to create a user cluster with the bundled MetalLB
load balancer and using your DHCP server to get IP addresses for your
cluster worker nodes.
You can use MetalLB for the user cluster only if your admin cluster is
using MetalLB. This load balancing option requires minimal
configuration. MetalLB runs directly on your cluster nodes and doesn't
require extra VMs. For more information about the benefits of using
MetalLB and how it compares to the other load balancing options, see
Bundled load balancing with MetalLB .
The example command creates a user cluster with the following
characteristics, which you can modify as needed for your environment.
Flag
Description
--admin-users
Grants you and another user full administrative rights on the
cluster.
--enable-control-plane-v2
Enables Controlplane V2, which is recommended and required in version
1.30 and higher.
--control-plane-ip-block
One IP address for the control plane node. To create a
high-availability (HA) user cluster, specify three IP address and
add the flag --replicas=3 .
--metal-lb-config-address-pools
Two address pools for the MetalLB load balancer. You need at
least one address pool, and you can specify more if needed. For
convenience, the example contains an address pool with the name
"ingress-vip-pool" as a reminder that the IP address for the
ingress VIP must be in one of the address pools. You specify
the CIDR for a single IP address by appending /32 to the
IP address.
gcloud container vmware clusters create USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--admin-cluster-membership= ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \

--enable-dhcp
Replace the following:
USER_CLUSTER_NAME : A name of your choice for your user
cluster. The name can't be changed after the cluster is created.
The name must:
contain at most 40 characters
contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or a hyphen ( - )
start with an alphabetic character
end with an alphanumeric character
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project that you
want to create the cluster in. The specified project is also used as the
fleet host project. This must be the same project that the admin cluster is
registered to. After the user cluster is created, it is automatically
registered to the selected project's fleet. The fleet host project
can't be changed after the cluster is created.
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the admin cluster
that manages the user cluster. In the --admin-cluster-membership
flag, you can use the fully-specified cluster name, which has the
following format:
projects/ FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID /locations/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION /memberships/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME
Alternativly, you can set --admin-cluster-membership to the
admin cluster's name, as in the example command. When you use only the
admin cluster's name, set the admin cluster's project ID with the
--admin-cluster-membership-project and location with
--admin-cluster-membership-location . The admin cluster's
location is either global or a Google Cloud region. If you
need to find the region, run gcloud container fleet memberships
list .
REGION : The Google Cloud region in which the
GKE On-Prem API ( gkeonprem.googleapis.com ), Fleet service
( gkehub.googleapis.com ), and the Connect service
( gkeconnect.googleapis.com ) run. Specify us-west1
or another
supported region .
The region can't be changed after the cluster is created. This setting specifies the region
where the following are stored:
The user cluster metadata that the GKE On-Prem API needs
to manage the cluster lifecycle
The Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring data of system components
The Admin Audit log created by Cloud Audit Logs
The cluster name, project, and location together uniquely identify the
cluster in Google Cloud.
Important If you plan to install Cloud Service Mesh, you must
install version 1.19.3 or later. This is required because the
Fleet and Connect services run in a region.
VERSION : The Google Distributed Cloud version for your
user cluster.
YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS and ANOTHER_EMAIL_ADDRESS :
If you don't include the --admin-users flag, as the cluster creator,
by default you are granted cluster admin privileges. But If you include
--admin-users to designate another user as an administrator, you
override the default and need to include both your email address and the
email address of the other administrator. For example, to add two
administrators:
--admin-users=sara@example.com \
--admin-users=amal@example.com
When the cluster is created, the GKE On-Prem API applies the Kubernetes
role-based access control (RBAC) policies to the cluster to grant you and
other admin users the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin role, which
provides full access to every resource in the cluster in all namespaces.
Note: In addition to the Kubernetes RBAC policies, you must grant some
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to the users who aren't project owners.
For details on granting the IAM roles, see
Grant required roles .
SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK : A range of IP addresses, in CIDR
format, to be used for Services in your cluster. Must be at least a /24 range.
Example: --service-address-cidr-blocks=10.96.0.0/20
POD_CIDR_BLOCK : A range of IP addresses, in CIDR
format, to be used for Pods in your cluster. Must be at least a /18 range.
Example: --pod-address-cidr-blocks=192.168.0.0/16
--metal-lb-config-address-pools : Include this flag to specify the configuration for
address pools to be used by the MetalLB load balancer. The value for the flag has the
following format:
--metal-lb-config-address-pool 'pool= NAME ,avoid-buggy-ips= True|False ,manual-assign= True|False ,addresses= IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_1 ; IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_2 ;...' \
The value has segments that start with the keywords
pool , avoid-buggy-ip , manual-assign , and
addresses . Separate each segment with a comma.
pool : A name of your choice for the pool.
avoid-buggy-ips 1: If you set this to True , the MetalLB controller
will not assign IP addresses ending in .0 or .255 to Services. This avoids the problem of
buggy consumer devices mistakenly dropping traffic sent to those special IP addresses. If not
specified, defaults to False .
manual-assign : If you do not want the MetalLB controller to
automatically assign IP addresses from this pool to Services, set this to True .
Then a developer can create a Service of type LoadBalancer and manually specify
one of the addresses from the pool. If not specified, manual-assign is set to
False .
In the list of addresses : Each address must be a range either in
CIDR notation or
hyphenated-range format. To specify a single IP address in a pool
(such as for the ingress VIP), use /32 in CIDR notation, for example:
192.0.2.1/32 .
Note the following:
Surround the entire value in single quotes.
Whitespace isn't allowed.
Separate each IP address range with a semicolon.
For example:
--metal-lb-config-address-pool 'pool=pool1,avoid-buggy-ips=True,manual-assign=True,addresses=10.251.134.80/32;192.168.1.0/26;192.168.1.2-192.168.1.3'
CONTROL_PLANE_VIP : The IP address that you have
chosen to configure on the load balancer for the Kubernetes API server
of the user cluster.
Example: --control-plane-vip=203.0.113.3
INGRESS_VIP : The IP address that you have chosen to
configure on the load balancer for the ingress proxy.
Example: --ingress-vip=10.251.134.80
The IP address for the ingress VIP must be in one of the MetalLB
address pools.
--enable-dhcp : Include --enable-dhcp if you want your cluster nodes
to get their IP address from a DHCP server that you provide. Don't
include this flag if you want to provide static IP addresses for your
cluster nodes, or if you want to set up manual load balancing.
MetalLB & static IPs
This example shows how to create a user cluster with the bundled MetalLB
load balancer and assigning static IP addresses to your cluster
worker nodes.
You can use MetalLB for the user cluster only if your admin cluster is
using MetalLB. This load balancing option requires minimal
configuration. MetalLB runs directly on your cluster nodes and doesn't
require extra VMs. For more information about the benefits of using
MetalLB and how it compares to the other load balancing options, see
Bundled load balancing with MetalLB .
The example command creates a user cluster with the following
characteristics, which you can modify as needed for your environment.
Flag
Description
--admin-users
Grants you and another user full administrative rights on the
cluster.
--enable-control-plane-v2
Enables Controlplane V2, which is recommended and required in version
1.30 and higher.
--control-plane-ip-block
One IP address for the control plane node. To create a
high-availability (HA) user cluster, specify three IP address and
add the flag --replicas=3 .
--metal-lb-config-address-pools
Two address pools for the MetalLB load balancer. You need at
least one address pool, and you can specify more if needed. For
convenience, the example contains an address pool with the name
"ingress-vip-pool" as a reminder that the IP address for the
ingress VIP must be in one of the address pools. You specify
the CIDR for a single IP address by appending /32 to the
IP address.
--static-ip-config-ip-blocks
Four IP addresses for the worker nodes in the clusters. This includes
an address for an extra node that can be used during upgrade and update.
You can specify more IP addresses if needed. The hostname is

Replace the following:
USER_CLUSTER_NAME : A name of your choice for your user
cluster. The name can't be changed after the cluster is created.
The name must:
contain at most 40 characters
contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or a hyphen ( - )
start with an alphabetic character
end with an alphanumeric character
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project that you
want to create the cluster in. The specified project is also used as the
fleet host project. This must be the same project that the admin cluster is
registered to. After the user cluster is created, it is automatically
registered to the selected project's fleet. The fleet host project
can't be changed after the cluster is created.
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the admin cluster
that manages the user cluster. In the --admin-cluster-membership
flag, you can use the fully-specified cluster name, which has the
following format:
projects/ FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID /locations/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION /memberships/ ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME
Alternativly, you can set --admin-cluster-membership to the
admin cluster's name, as in the example command. When you use only the
admin cluster's name, set the admin cluster's project ID with the
--admin-cluster-membership-project and location with
--admin-cluster-membership-location . The admin cluster's
location is either global or a Google Cloud region. If you
need to find the region, run gcloud container fleet memberships
list .
REGION : The Google Cloud region in which the
GKE On-Prem API ( gkeonprem.googleapis.com ), Fleet service
( gkehub.googleapis.com ), and the Connect service
( gkeconnect.googleapis.com ) run. Specify us-west1
or another
supported region .
The region can't be changed after the cluster is created. This setting specifies the region
where the following are stored:
The user cluster metadata that the GKE On-Prem API needs
to manage the cluster lifecycle
The Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring data of system components
The Admin Audit log created by Cloud Audit Logs
The cluster name, project, and location together uniquely identify the
cluster in Google Cloud.
Important If you plan to install Cloud Service Mesh, you must
install version 1.19.3 or later. This is required because the
Fleet and Connect services run in a region.
VERSION : The Google Distributed Cloud version for your
user cluster.
YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS and ANOTHER_EMAIL_ADDRESS :
If you don't include the --admin-users flag, as the cluster creator,
by default you are granted cluster admin privileges. But If you include
--admin-users to designate another user as an administrator, you
override the default and need to include both your email address and the
email address of the other administrator. For example, to add two
administrators:
--admin-users=sara@example.com \
--admin-users=amal@example.com
When the cluster is created, the GKE On-Prem API applies the Kubernetes
role-based access control (RBAC) policies to the cluster to grant you and
other admin users the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin role, which
provides full access to every resource in the cluster in all namespaces.
Note: In addition to the Kubernetes RBAC policies, you must grant some
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to the users who aren't project owners.
For details on granting the IAM roles, see
Grant required roles .
SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK : A range of IP addresses, in CIDR
format, to be used for Services in your cluster. Must be at least a /24 range.
Example: --service-address-cidr-blocks=10.96.0.0/20
POD_CIDR_BLOCK : A range of IP addresses, in CIDR
format, to be used for Pods in your cluster. Must be at least a /18 range.
Example: --pod-address-cidr-blocks=192.168.0.0/16
--metal-lb-config-address-pools : Include this flag to specify the configuration for
address pools to be used by the MetalLB load balancer. The value for the flag has the
following format:
--metal-lb-config-address-pool 'pool= NAME ,avoid-buggy-ips= True|False ,manual-assign= True|False ,addresses= IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_1 ; IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_2 ;...' \
The value has segments that start with the keywords
pool , avoid-buggy-ip , manual-assign , and
addresses . Separate each segment with a comma.
pool : A name of your choice for the pool.
avoid-buggy-ips 1: If you set this to True , the MetalLB controller
will not assign IP addresses ending in .0 or .255 to Services. This avoids the problem of
buggy consumer devices mistakenly dropping traffic sent to those special IP addresses. If not
specified, defaults to False .
manual-assign : If you do not want the MetalLB controller to
automatically assign IP addresses from this pool to Services, set this to True .
Then a developer can create a Service of type LoadBalancer and manually specify
one of the addresses from the pool. If not specified, manual-assign is set to
False .
In the list of addresses : Each address must be a range either in
CIDR notation or
hyphenated-range format. To specify a single IP address in a pool
(such as for the ingress VIP), use /32 in CIDR notation, for example:
192.0.2.1/32 .
Note the following:
Surround the entire value in single quotes.
Whitespace isn't allowed.
Separate each IP address range with a semicolon.
For example:
--metal-lb-config-address-pool 'pool=pool1,avoid-buggy-ips=True,manual-assign=True,addresses=10.251.134.80/32;192.168.1.0/26;192.168.1.2-192.168.1.3'
CONTROL_PLANE_VIP : The IP address that you have
chosen to configure on the load balancer for the Kubernetes API server
of the user cluster.
Example: --control-plane-vip=203.0.113.3
INGRESS_VIP : The IP address that you have chosen to
configure on the load balancer for the ingress proxy.
Example: --ingress-vip=10.251.134.80
The IP address for the ingress VIP must be in one of the MetalLB
address pools.
--static-ip-config-ip-blocks : Specify the default gateway, subnet mask, and a list
of the static IP addresses for the worker nodes in the user cluster. The value for the flag has
the following format:
--static-ip-config-ip-blocks 'gateway= GATEWAY ,netmask= NETMASK ,ips= IP_ADDRESS_1 ; IP_ADDRESS_2 HOST_2 ;...'
The value has segments that start with the keywords gateway , netmask ,
and ips . Separate the segments with a comma.
Note the following:
Surround the entire value in single quotes.
Whitespace isn't allowed except between an IP address and a hostname.
In the list of IP addresses:
You can specify an individual IP address or a
CIDR block of IP addresses.
Separate each IP address or CIDR block with a semicolon.
For an individual IP address, you can optionally specify a hostname after the IP address.
Separate the IP address and the hostname with a space. When you don't specify a hostname,
Google Distributed Cloud uses the VM's name from vSphere as the hostname.
If you specify a CIDR block, do not specify a value for hostname.
For example:
--static-ip-config-ip-blocks 'gateway=172.16.23.254,netmask=255.255.252.0,ips=172.16.20.10;172.16.20.11 host2;172.16.20.12/30'
DNS_SERVER : A comma-separated list of the IP addresses of DNS
servers for the VMs.
DNS_SEARCH_DOMAIN : A comma-separated list of the DNS search
domains for the hosts to use. These domains are used as part of a domain search list.
For example:
--dns-search-domains example.com,examplepetstore.com
NTP_SERVER : A comma-separated list of the IP
addresses of time servers for the VMs to use.
Manual LB & static IPs
This example shows how to create a user cluster with a manual load
balancer and assigning static IP addresses to your cluster
worker nodes.
You can use a manual load balancer for the user cluster only if your admin
cluster uses a manual load balancer. In Google Distributed Cloud, the
Kubernetes API server, ingress proxy, and the add-on service for log
aggregation are each exposed by a Kubernetes Service of type
LoadBalancer . Choose your own nodePort values in the 30000 - 32767
range for these Services. For the ingress proxy, choose a nodePort value
for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. See
Enabling manual load balancing mode
for more information.
The example command creates a user cluster with the following
characteristics, which you can modify as needed for your environment.
Flag
Description
--admin-users
Grants you and another user full administrative rights on the
cluster.
--enable-control-plane-v2
Enables Controlplane V2, which is recommended and required in version
1.30 and higher.
--control-plane-ip-block

high-availability (HA) user cluster, specify three IP address and
add the flag --replicas=3 .
--static-ip-config-ip-blocks
Four IP addresses for the worker nodes in the clusters. This includes
an address for an extra node that can be used during upgrade and update.
You can specify more IP addresses if needed. The hostname is
optional.

Control plane flags
If you want to use non-default values for the control plane configuration,
include one or more of the following flags:
--cpus= vCPUS : The number of vCPUs (minimum 4) for each
control-plane node for your user cluster. If not specified, the default
is 4 vCPUs.
--memory= MEMORY : The memory size in mebibytes (MiB)
for each control-plane for your user cluster. The minimum value is 8192 and
it must be a multiple of 4. If not specified, the default is 8192.
--replicas= NODES : The number of control-plane nodes for
your user cluster. For example, you may select 1 control-plane node for a
development environment and 3 control-planes nodes for high availability
(HA), production environments.
--enable-auto-resize : If you want to enable automatic resizing of the
control-plane nodes for the user cluster, include --enable-auto-resize .
Resizing means that the vCPU and memory resources assigned to a node are
adjusted automatically. When enabled, the control-plane nodes for the user
cluster are resized according to the number of worker nodes in the user
cluster. So as you add more worker nodes to the user cluster, the
control-plane nodes are increased in size.
--enable-control-plane-v2 : To enable Controlplane V2, which we recommend,
include this flag. When Controlplane V2 is enabled, the control
plane for a user cluster runs on one or more nodes in the user cluster
itself. In version 1.30 and higher, Controlplane V2 is required.
When you enable Controlplane V2, you must also specify the following flags:
--dns-servers= DNS_SERVER_1 ,... : A comma-separated
list of the IP addresses of DNS servers for the VMs.
--ntp-servers= NTP_SERVER_1 ,... : A comma-separated
list of the IP addresses of time servers for the VMs to use.
--control-plane-ip-block , which has the following format:
--control-plane-ip-block 'gateway= CP_GATEWAY ,netmask= CP_NETMASK ,ips= CP_IP_ADDRESS_1 ; CP_IP_ADDRESS_2 CP_HOST_2 '
The value has segments that start with the keywords gateway ,
netmask , and ips . Separate the segments with a comma.
Note the following:
Surround the entire value in single quotes.
Whitespace isn't allowed except between an IP address and a
hostname.
In the list of IP addresses:
You can specify an individual IP address or a
CIDR
block of IP addresses.
Separate each IP address or CIDR block with a semicolon.
For an individual IP address, you can optionally specify a hostname
after the IP address. Separate the IP address and the hostname
with a space.
If you specify a CIDR block, do not specify a value for hostname.
For example:
--control-plane-ip-block 'gateway=192.168.0.1,netmask=255.0.0.0,ips=192.168.1.1;192.168.1.2 hostname-2;192.168.2.2/28`
Optional: --dns-search-domains= DNS_SEARCH_DOMAIN_1 ,... :
A comma-separated list of the DNS search domains for the hosts to use.
These domains are used as part of a domain search list.
For example:
--dns-search-domains example.com,examplepetstore.com
For a complete list of the flags and their descriptions, see the
gcloud CLI reference .
vSphere flags
Specify the following optional flags if needed:
--disable-aag-config : If you don't include this flag the VMware
Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) anti-affinity rules are
automatically created for your user cluster's nodes, causing them to be
spread across at least 3 physical hosts in your data center. Make
sure that your vSphere environment meets the
requirements .
If your cluster doesn't meet the requirements, include this flag.
Note: If you followed
Set up minimal infrastructure ,
you only have one ESXi host, so be sure to include this flag.
--disable-vsphere-csi : If you don't include this flag, the vSphere
Container Storage Interface (CSI) components are deployed in the user
cluster. The CSI driver runs in a native Kubernetes cluster
deployed in vSphere to provision persistent volumes on vSphere storage.
For more information, see
Using the vSphere Container Storage Interface driver .
If you don't want to deploy the CSI components, include this flag.
For a complete list of the flags and their descriptions, see the
gcloud CLI reference
Track cluster creation progress
The output from the cluster create command is similar to the following:
Waiting for operation [projects/example-project-12345/locations/us-west1/operations/operation-1679543737105-5f7893fd5bae9-942b3f97-75e59179] to complete.
In the example output, the string operation-1679543737105-5f7893fd5bae9-942b3f97-75e59179
is the OPERATION_ID of the long-running operation. You
can find out the status of the operation with the following command:
gcloud container vmware operations describe OPERATION_ID \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION
For more information, see
gcloud container vmware operations .
It takes 15 minutes or more to create the user cluster. You can view
the cluster in the Google Cloud console on the
GKE clusters
page.
Create a node pool
After the cluster is created, you need to create at least one node pool before
deploying workloads.
gcloud container vmware node-pools create NODE_POOL_NAME \
--cluster= USER_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION \
--image-type= IMAGE_TYPE \
--boot-disk-size= BOOT_DISK_SIZE \
--cpus= vCPUS \
--memory= MEMORY \
--replicas= NODES \
--enable-load-balancer
Replace the following:
NODE_POOL_NAME : A name of your choice for the node
pool. The name must:
contain at most 40 characters
contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or a hyphen ( - )
start with an alphabetic character
end with an alphanumeric character
USER_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the newly-created
user cluster.
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project that
the cluster is registered to.
REGION : The Google Cloud region that you
specified when you created the cluster.
IMAGE_TYPE : The type of OS image to run on the VMs in
the node pool. Set to one of the follow: ubuntu_containerd or cos .
BOOT_DISK_SIZE : The size of the boot disk in
gibibytes (GiB) for each node in the pool. The minimum is 40 GiB.
vCPUs : The number of vCPUs for each node in the
node pool. The minimum is 4.
MEMORY : The memory size in mebibytes (MiB) for each
node in the pool. The minimum is 8192 MiB per user cluster worker node and
the value must be a multiple of 4.
NODES : The number of nodes in the node pool. The
minimum is 3.
If you are using MetalLB as the load balancer, optionally, include
--enable-load-balancer if you want to allow the MetalLB speaker to run on
the nodes in the pool. MetalLB must be enabled in at least one node pool.
If you don't include this flag, you must create another node pool to use for
MetalLB.
For information about optional flags, see
Add a node pool
and the

Terraform
Before you begin
Get the name and the fleet membership location of your admin cluster:
gcloud container fleet memberships list \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID
Replace FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID with ID of the
project that the admin cluster is registered to.
The output is similar to the following:
NAME EXTERNAL_ID LOCATION
admin-cluster-1 bb7803b4-8438-4b22-859f-4559b4b29072 global
admin-cluster-2 ee16ee2b-6ec0-49fc-9413-3c89cbc70854 global
admin-cluster-3 fc2b7ef5-39ff-4b63-b919-04c5adc67be4 us-west1
The location specifies where the Fleet and Connect services run. Admin
clusters created prior to 1.28 are managed by the global Fleet and
Connect services. In 1.28 and later, you can specify either global or
a Google Cloud region when you create the cluster.
Get a list of available versions:
gcloud container vmware clusters query-version-config \
--admin-cluster-membership= ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--admin-cluster-membership-project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--admin-cluster-membership-location= ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION \
--location= REGION
Replace the following:
ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME : The name of the admin cluster.
FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID : The ID of the project that
the admin cluster is registered to.
ADMIN_CLUSTER_REGION : The admin cluster's
fleet membership region. This is either global or a Google Cloud
region. Use the location for the admin cluster from the output
of gcloud container fleet memberships list .
REGION : The Google Cloud region that you
will use when you create the cluster. This is the region in which
the GKE On-Prem API and the Fleet and Connect services run. Specify
us-west1 or another
supported region .
The output of the command is similar to the following:
versions:
- isInstalled: true
version: 1.14.3-gke.25
- version: 1.14.4-gke.54
- version: 1.15.0-gke.581
The command also outputs an explanation of the versions that you can use
for user cluster creation or upgrade. Allowable versions are annotated with
isInstalled: true , which means the admin cluster has the version-specific
components it needs to manage user clusters of that version. If you want to
use a version that is installed on the admin cluster, skip to the
Example section to create the user cluster.
Install a different version
An admin cluster can manage user clusters at different versions. The output
of the query-version-config command lists other versions that you can use
when you create the cluster. If you want to create a user cluster that is a
different version than the admin cluster, you need to download and deploy the
components that the admin cluster needs to manage user clusters of that version,
as follows:
gcloud container vmware admin-clusters update ADMIN_CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= FLEET_HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--location= REGION \
--required-platform-version= VERSION
Replace VERSION with one of the versions listed in the
output of the query-version-config command.
The command downloads the version of the components that you specify in
--required-platform-version to the admin cluster, and then deploys the
the components. You can now create a user cluster with the specified
version.
If you rerun the gcloud container vmware clusters query-version-config ,
the version that you specified is annotated with isInstalled: true .
Example
You can use the following basic configuration sample to create a user cluster
with the bundled MetalLB load balancer and one node pool using the Google
provider for Terraform.
When you create a user cluster, the Terraform configuration file must contain at
least one
google_gkeonprem_vmware_node_pool
resource to create a node pool. Terraform can't create the node pool resource,
however, until it has completed all operations on the upstream
google_gkeonprem_vmware_cluster user cluster resource. To enforce this
dependency, include a depends_on statement in the
google_gkeonprem_vmware_node_pool resource as shown in the following example
main.tf file. For more information about using depends_on for specifying
resource dependencies, see the Terraform resource
documentation .
To learn more about the example, click the following link:
main.tf for creating a user cluster
The example main.tf contains the following modules and
resources:
enable_google_apis_primary : enables the required Google
APIs in the project. You only need to enable the APIs in a project
once. If the APIs have already been enabled in your project, you don't
need to include this in a Terraform configuration file.
google_project_service : enables the
GKE On-Prem API in the project. Like the other required Google APIs,
you only need to enable the GKE On-Prem API once.
gcloud_update_admin_cluster_platform_controller :
updates the platform controller on your admin cluster. This
is necessary for user cluster upgrades. If the admin cluster is
already on the correct version, then this module doesn't change
anything. Although this module is optional, user cluster creation
fails if there is a version mismatch between the version of the
platform controller on the admin cluster and the version you
specify for the user cluster.
google_gkeonprem_vmware_cluster : creates
the user cluster. This resource is required. The user cluster is enrolled
in the GKE On-Prem API and is registered to the same fleet as the
admin cluster. The example creates the cluster using the bundled
MetalLB. The google_gkeonprem_vmware_cluster
reference documentation provides an example of configuring a manual
load balancer.
google_gkeonprem_vmware_node_pool :
creates a node pool. This resource is required in the Terraform
configuration file. A newly created user cluster must have at least one
node pool to transition to a healthy state.

Set variables in terraform.tfvars
The sample provides an example variables file to pass in to main.tf , which
shows how to configure the bundled MetalLB load balancer and enable
your cluster nodes to get their IP addresses from a DHCP server that you
provide.
Clone the anthos-samples repository and change to the directory
where the Terraform sample is located:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-samples
cd anthos-samples/anthos-onprem-terraform/avmw_user_cluster_metallb
Make a copy of the terraform.tfvars.sample file:
cp terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars
Modify the parameters values in terraform.tfvars .

The following list describes the variables:
project_id : The ID of the project that you want to create the cluster
in. The specified project is also used as the fleet host project. This
must be the same project that the admin cluster is registered to. After
the user cluster is created, it is automatically registered to the
selected project's fleet. The fleet host project can't be changed after
the cluster is created.
region : The Google Cloud region in which the
GKE On-Prem API ( gkeonprem.googleapis.com ), Fleet service
( gkehub.googleapis.com ), and the Connect service
( gkeconnect.googleapis.com ) run. Specify us-west1 or another
supported region .
admin_cluster_name : The name of the admin cluster that manages the user
cluster. The example assumes that the admin cluster uses global as the
region. If you have a regional admin cluster:
Open main.tf in a text editor.
Search for admin_cluster_membership , which looks like the
following:
admin_cluster_membership = "projects/${var.project_id}/locations/global/memberships/${var.admin_cluster_name}"
Change global to the region that the admin cluster uses and save the file.
on_prem_version : The Google Distributed Cloud version for your user cluster.
admin_user_emails : A list of email addresses of the users to be granted
administrative privileges on the cluster. Be sure to add your email
address if you intend to administer the cluster.
When the cluster is created, the GKE On-Prem API applies the
Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies to the cluster
to grant the admin users the Kubernetes clusterrole/cluster-admin
role, which provides full access to every resource in the cluster
in all namespaces. This also lets users log on to the
console using their Google identity.
cluster_name : A name of your choice for your user cluster. The name
can't be changed after the cluster is created. The name must:
contain at most 40 characters
contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or a hyphen ( - )
start with an alphabetic character
end with an alphanumeric character
control_plane_node_cpus : The number of vCPUs for each control-plane
node for your user cluster. The minimum is 4 vCPUs.
control_plane_node_memory : The memory size in mebibytes (MiB) for each
control-plane for your user cluster. The minimum value is 8192 and
it must be a multiple of 4.
control_plane_node_replicas : The number of control-plane nodes for
your user cluster. For example, you may enter 1 control-plane node for a
development environment and 3 control-planes nodes for high availability
(HA), production environments.
control_plane_vip : The virtual IP address (VIP) that you have chosen
to configure on the load balancer for the Kubernetes API server of the
user cluster.
ingress_vip : The IP address that you have chosen to configure on the
load balancer for the ingress proxy.
lb_address_pools : A list of maps that define the address pools to be
used by the MetalLB load balancer. The ingress VIP must be in one of
these pools. Specify the following:
name : A name for the pool.
addresses : An address range either in
CIDR notation or
hyphenated-range format. To specify a single IP
address in a pool (such as for the ingress VIP), use /32 in CIDR
notation, for example: 192.0.2.1/32 .
Replace the example IP addresses with your values, and add additional
address pools if needed.
Save the changes in terraform.tfvars . If you don't want to make any
optional changes to main.tf , skip to the section that follows,
Create the cluster and one node pool .
Configure Controlplane V2
In version 1.30 and higher, you must enable Controlplane V2. The main.tf
file in the example doesn't enable Controlplane V2. You must change
main.tf to enable Controlplane V2 and add the IP addresses for the
gateway, netmask, and control-plane nodes. Before making changes, make a
backup of main.tf :
cp main.tf main.tf.bak
To configure Controlplane V2, make the following changes to main.tf :
Add the following line to the resource block:
enable_control_plane_v2 = "true"
Add a control_plane_v2_config map to the network_config block, for
example:
control_plane_v2_config {
control_plane_ip_block {
netmask = "255.255.252.0"
gateway = "10.250.71.254"
ips {
ip = "10.250.68.54"
hostname = "cpv2-vm1"
}
ips {
ip = "10.250.68.128"
hostname = "cpv2-vm2"
}
ips {
ip = "10.250.71.50"
hostname = "cpv2-vm3"
}
}
}
Replace the values for netmask and gateway with IP addresses from your
network. Replace ip and hostname with the IP addresses of your
control plane nodes.
Optional: Enable advanced cluster
By default in version 1.32 and higher, user clusters created using Terraform
don't have advanced cluster enabled. If you want to enable advanced cluster, add
the following top-level field to main.tf :
enable_advanced_cluster = true
Be sure to review
Differences when running advanced clusters
before enabling advanced cluster.
Optional: Worker node IP addressing mode
This section explains some optional configuration changes that you can
make in main.tf . Before making changes, make a backup of main.tf :
cp main.tf main.tf.bak
By default, main.tf configures the cluster to use a DHCP server that you
provide to assign IP addresses to the cluster's worker nodes. DHCP is
configured by including the dhcp_config map within the network_config
block. If you want to provide static IP addresses for your worker nodes, make
the following changes to main.tf :
Replace the network_config block and include a static_ip_config block.
For example:
network_config {
service_address_cidr_blocks = [ "10.96.0.0/12" ]
pod_address_cidr_blocks = [ "192.168.0.0/16" ]
host_config {
dns_servers = [ "10.254.41.1" ]
ntp_servers = [ "216.239.35.8" ]
}
static_ip_config {
ip_blocks {
netmask = "255.255.252.0"
gateway = "10.251.31.254"
ips {
ip = "10.251.30.153"
hostname = "vm-1"
}
ips {
ip = "10.251.31.206"
hostname = "vm-2"
}
ips {
ip = "10.251.31.193"
hostname = "vm-3"
}
ips {
ip = "10.251.30.230"
hostname = "vm-4"
}
}
}
}
Replace the following with your values:
service_address_cidr_blocks : A range of IP addresses, in CIDR format,
to be used for Services in your cluster. Must be at least a /24 range.
pod_address_cidr_blocks : A range of IP addresses, in CIDR format, to
be used for Pods in your cluster. Must be at least a /18 range.
dns_servers : A list of the IP addresses of DNS servers for the VMs.
ntp_servers : A list of the IP addresses of time servers for the VMs
to use.
In the static_ip_config block, replace the values for netmask
and gateway with the addresses for your network. Replace ip and
hostname with the IP addresses and hostnames of your worker nodes.
Create the cluster and one node pool
Initialize and create the Terraform plan:
terraform init
Terraform installs any needed libraries, such as the Google Cloud provider.
Review the configuration and make changes if needed:
terraform plan
Apply the Terraform plan to create the user cluster:
terraform apply
It takes about 15 minutes or more to create the user cluster, and
another 15 minutes to create the node pool. You can view
the cluster in the Google Cloud console on the
GKE clusters
page.
Optional: Run command-line tools before resource creation
If needed, you can run command-line tools such as the gcloud CLI and
gkectl to perform setup or configuration tasks before resource creation. You
define the command lines to run within the Terraform configuration file using
the local-exec provisioner, which lets you reuse the defined Terraform
variables.
The following example shows how to modify main.tf to run the
gkectl prepare command before cluster creation:
resource "null_resource" "gkectl_prepare" {
provisioner "local-exec" {
command = "gkectl prepare --kubeconfig=${var.kubeconfig} --cluster-name=${var.cluster_name} --vcenter-username=${var.vcenter_username} --vcenter-password=${var.vcenter_password} --vcenter-address=${var.vcenter_address} --datacenter=${var.datacenter} --datastore=${var.datastore} --network=${var.network} --os-image=${var.os_image} --service-account-key-file=${var.service_account_key_file} --location=${var.location}"
working_dir = path.module # Important: Set working directory
environment = {
# Optional: set environment variables if needed.
# Example: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "/path/to/your/credentials.json"
}
}
}
resource "google_gkeonprem_vmware_cluster" "cluster" {
# ... your cluster configuration ...
# Ensure this depends on the null_resource
depends_on = [ null_resource.gkectl_prepare ]
# ... rest of your cluster configuration ...
location = var.location
name = var.cluster_name
# ... other required fields ...
}
