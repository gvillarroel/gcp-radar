Create an admin workstation
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document shows how to create an admin workstation, for
Google Distributed Cloud. The admin workstation hosts command-line
interface (CLI) tools and configuration files to provision clusters during
installation, and CLI tools for interacting with provisioned clusters
post-installation.
This page is for Admins, Architects, and Operators who set up,
monitor, and manage the tech infrastructure. To learn more about common roles
and example tasks that we reference in Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
The instructions here are complete. For a shorter introduction to creating an
admin workstation, see Create an admin
workstation
in the Create basic clusters guide.
Choose how to create the admin workstation
There are two ways you can create an admin workstation:
Use gkeadm to create an admin workstation VM in your vSphere environment.
Create a user-managed admin workstation on any computer of your choice.
Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages.
When you use gkeadm to create your admin workstation, gkeadm does
the following, which simplifies the setup:
Creates the admin workstation VM.
The VM template that gkeadm uses to create the admin workstation has all the
software that you need to create and manage clusters using the gkectl
command-line tool.
Creates one user account that you or other administrators use to log on to the
admin workstation.
Provides the SSH command to log on to the admin workstation with the
provided user account.
A gkeadm -created admin workstation can only manage one admin cluster. If
you plan to create several admin clusters, then you need to create an admin
workstation for each admin cluster.
The gkeadm -created admin workstation is tied to cluster lifecycle. When you
upgrade an admin cluster or any of the user clusters managed by the admin
cluster, you first have to upgrade the admin workstation.
When you set up your own admin workstation, you have to install one of the
required operating systems and all the required software. This makes the initial
setup more time consuming because creating a VM from a template is faster than
installing the required software on a computer. However, after the workstation
is set up, it has the following advantages over a gkeadm -created admin
workstation:
You can configure the user-managed workstation to create and manage more
than one admin cluster.
You don't need to upgrade a user-managed admin workstation when you upgrade a
cluster.
You can use standard CI/CD tools to automate cluster lifecycle management.
You can use standard authentication methods such as Active Directory to
control access to the admin workstation.
You can use standard authorization systems to control what users can
access on the admin workstation and to audit their actions.
You can choose the software that you want to use to create snapshots or
backups of the admin workstation.
Create the admin workstation
gkeadm
Before you begin
Know your vCenter server address.
Know your CA cert path.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
Create one or more Google Cloud projects as described in
Using multiple Google Cloud projects .
Planning your service accounts
When you use gkeadm to create an admin workstation, you have the option of
letting gkeadm create some of your service accounts and keys for you. In that
case, gkeadm also grants the appropriate Identity and Access Management roles to the service
accounts.
As an alternative, you can create your service accounts and keys manually.
In that case, you must manually grant IAM roles to your service
accounts.
Creating service accounts manually gives you more flexibility than having
gkeadm create them for you:
Automatically created service accounts all have the same parent
Google Cloud project as your component access service account.
When you create a service account manually, you can choose the parent
Google Cloud project.
Automatically created service accounts are all granted IAM
roles on the parent Google Cloud project of your component access service
account. This is fine if that is the only Google Cloud project associated
with your clusters. But if you want to associate your clusters with
multiple Google Cloud projects ,
then you need the flexibility to grant roles to a service account on a
Google Cloud project of your choice.
If you decide to create your own service accounts, follow the instructions in
Service accounts and keys .
Regardless of whether you have gkeadm create service accounts
for you automatically, there is one service account that you must create
manually: your component access service account. For instructions on how to create
your component access service account and grant it the appropriate
IAM roles, see
Component access service account .
There is one other service account that you might need to create manually:
your
audit logging service account .
If you want to use a
GKE On-Prem API
client to manage your user clusters, then you must enable
audit logging
in your admin cluster.
Generating templates for your configuration files
Download gkeadm to your current directory.
Generate templates:
./gkeadm create config
The preceding command created these files in your current directory:
credential.yaml
admin-ws-config.yaml
Filling in credential.yaml
In credential.yaml , fill in your vCenter username and password. For example:
kind: CredentialFile
items:
- name: vCenter
username: "my-account-name"
password: "AadmpqGPqq!a"
Filling in admin-ws-config.yaml
Note: Admin workstations cannot contain special characters and cannot be renamed
after creation.
Several fields in admin-ws-config.yaml are already filled in with default
or generated values. You can keep the populated values or make changes as you
prefer.
See the fields that are already filled in.
vCenter:
credentials:
fileRef:
path: credential.yaml
entry: vCenter
adminWorkstation:
name: gke-admin-ws-...
cpus: 4
memoryMB: 8192
diskGB: 100
dataDiskName: gke-on-prem-admin-workstation-data-disk,,,.vmdk
dataDiskMB: 512
network:
ntpServer: ntp.ubuntu.com
Warning: If you will be using static IPs for your admin and user clusters,
make sure that admin workstation name specified in admin-ws-config.yaml
isn't included as a hostname in the IP block files
admin-ip-block.yaml and user-ip-block.yaml .
Fields that you must fill in
Fill in the following required fields. For information on how to fill in the fields,
Admin workstation configuration file .
gcp:
componentAccessServiceAccountKeyPath: " Fill in "
vCenter:
credentials:
address: " Fill in "
datacenter: " Fill in "
datastore: " Fill in "
cluster: " Fill in "
network: " Fill in "
resourcePool: " Fill in "
caCertPath: " Fill in "
If you want to create your admin workstation inside a vSphere VM folder, fill in the vCenter.folder field:
vCenter:
folder: " Fill in "
If your admin workstation will be behind a proxy server, fill in the
proxyURL field:
adminWorkstation:
proxyURL: " Fill in "
If you want your admin workstation to get its IP address from a DHCP server,
set ipAllocationMode to "dhcp" , and remove the hostconfig section:
adminWorkstation:
network:
ipAllocationMode: "dhcp"
If you want to specify a static IP address for your admin workstation, set
ipAllocationMode to "static" , and fill in the
hostconfig
section:
adminWorkstation:
network:
ipAllocationMode: "static"
hostconfig:
ip: " Fill in "
gateway: " Fill in "
netmask: " Fill in "
dns:
- " Fill in "
Note: Check the vCenter network to make sure the static IP address that you
enter is not already in use.
Logging in
Log in with any Google Account. This sets your SDK account property:
gcloud auth login
Verify that your SDK account property is set correctly:
gcloud config list
The Google Account that is set as your SDK account property
is called your SDK account . The gkeadm command-line tool uses your SDK
account to download the admin workstation OVA and enable services in your
Google Cloud project.
If you choose to have gkeadm automatically create service accounts for you,
then gkeadm also uses your SDK account to create service accounts and keys,
and to grant roles to service accounts.
So it is important that you set your SDK account property before you run
gkeadm to create an admin workstation.
The output shows the values of your SDK account property.
For example:
[core]
account = my-name@google.com
disable_usage_reporting = False
Your active configuration is: [default]
Grant roles to your SDK account
Your SDK account must have the following
IAM role
on the parent Google Cloud project of your component access service account.
This is so that gkeadm can enable services on the Google Cloud project.
serviceUsage.serviceUsageAdmin
If you choose to have gkeadm automatically create service accounts for you,
then your SDK account must also have the following roles on the parent
project of your component access service account. This is so that gkeadm can
create service accounts and keys.
resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin
iam.serviceAccountCreator
iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin
To grant roles on a Google Cloud project, you must have certain permissions on the
Google Cloud project. For details, see
Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources .
If you have the required permissions, you can grant the roles yourself.
Otherwise, someone else in your organization must grant the roles for you.
To grant the required role to your SDK account:
Linux and macOS
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member="user: ACCOUNT " \
--role="roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin"
Windows
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID ^
--member="user: ACCOUNT " ^
--role="roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the parent
Google Cloud project of your component access service account
ACCOUNT : your SDK account
To grant additional roles in case you want gkeadm to automatically create
service accounts:
Linux and macOS
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member="user: ACCOUNT " \
--role="roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member="user: ACCOUNT " \
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member="user: ACCOUNT " \
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
Windows
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID ^
--member="user: ACCOUNT " ^
--role="roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID ^
--member="user: ACCOUNT " ^
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID ^
--member="user: ACCOUNT " ^
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the parent project of your
component access service account
ACCOUNT : your SDK account
Creating your admin workstation
Enter this command to create your admin workstation. If you want
gkeadm to create the
connect-register
and
logging-monitoring
service accounts for you, include the
--auto-create-service-accounts flag. If you want to create those service
service accounts manually, omit the flag.
./gkeadm create admin-workstation [--auto-create-service-accounts]
The output gives detailed information about the creation of your admin
workstation:
...
Getting ... service account...
...
********************************************************************
Admin workstation is ready to use.
Admin workstation information saved to /usr/local/google/home/me/my-admin-workstation
This file is required for future upgrades
SSH into the admin workstation with the following command:
ssh -i /usr/local/google/home/me/.ssh/gke-admin-workstation ubuntu@172.16.5.1
********************************************************************
Getting an SSH connection to your admin workstation
Near the end of the preceding output there is a command you can use to get an
SSH connection to your admin workstation. Enter that command now. For example:
ssh -i /usr/local/google/home/me/.ssh/gke-admin-workstation ubuntu@172.16.5.1
List the files on your admin workstation:
ls -1
In the output, you can see two cluster configuration files, your CA
certificate file, and the JSON key file for your component access service
account. If gkeadm created service accounts for you, you can also
see the JSON key files for those service accounts. For example:
admin-cluster.yaml
user-cluster.yaml
vcenter-ca-cert.pem
component-access-key.json
Verify that gkeadm activated your component access service account on your
admin workstation:
gcloud config get-value account
Copying JSON key files to your admin workstation
Before you create a cluster, the JSON key files for your service accounts must
be on your admin workstation in the home directory.
The key for your component access service account is already on your admin
workstation.
If you included the --auto-create-service-accounts flag when you ran
gkeadm create admin-workstation , then then the keys for the following service
accounts are already on your admin workstation in the home directory. Otherwise
you must manually copy the keys to the home directory of your admin workstation:
Connect-register service account
Logging-monitoring service account
If you created any of the following service accounts, you must manually copy the
keys for those service accounts to the home directory of your admin workstation:
Audit logging service account
Binary Authorization service account
Restoring the admin workstation from a backup file
When you upgrade an admin workstation, the gkeadm upgrade
command saves a backup file. Later, if you no longer have an admin
workstation, or if you have lost some of the files that were on your upgraded
admin workstation, you can use this backup file to create an admin workstation
that is restored to what was in place immediately after the upgrade.
To create an admin workstation from a backup file, run this command:
gkeadm create admin-workstation --restore-from-backup ADMIN_WORKSTATION_NAME -backup.tar.gz
Replace ADMIN_WORKSTATION_NAME with the name of the admin workstation.
User-managed
Choose a computer to serve as your admin workstation. You can use either
Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). These are the requirements:
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS
4 CPU cores
8 GiB RAM
100 GiB of storage
RHEL 8.6, 8.7, or 8.8
4 CPU cores
12 GB RAM
256 GiB of storage
Access to Google Cloud
Your admin workstation must have access to Google Cloud to download and
install tools, process authorization requests, create service accounts, and
more.
For information on different ways to connect to Google Cloud, see
Connect to Google .
Access to Google Cloud can be direct or via a proxy server.
For information on firewall rules and configuring a proxy server, see
Proxy and firewall rules .
Access to vCenter Server
To create and manage clusters from your admin workstation, you need access to
your instance of vCenter Server. For information, see:
vSphere requirements
Determine your vCenter server address
Getting your vCenter CA root certificate
Set up an NTP server
When your cluster is configured to use an NTP server, you need to set up a
time sync service on your admin workstation to ensure that timedatectl
reports time that is in sync with the cluster. This is required to avoid large
clock drift issues, which might cause certificate verification failures due
to unmatched expiration dates.
Ubuntu
We recommend that you use the chrony time server.
To install chrony :
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install chrony
This provides two binaries:
chronyd - the daemon to sync and serve via the Network Time Protocol
chronyc - the command-line interface for the chrony daemon
To configure chronyd :
Edit /etc/chrony/chrony.conf to add or remove server lines. Then restart
chrony :
sudo systemctl restart chrony.service
RHEL
We recommend that you use the chrony time server.
For installation instructions, see
How to configure chrony .
Passwordless sudo
If your security policy allows it, enable passwordless sudo for the
current user. This allows gkectl to prepare a private registry if one is
provided, setup proxy for docker if your network is behind a proxy server, and
force delete the bootstrap cluster that is used for admin cluster lifecycle
operations in case the deletion fails.
If you choose not to enable passwordless sudo, and you intend to use a
private registry
for your admin cluster, then do the following manual configuration before you
create the admin cluster:
Place the
CA root certificate
for the private registry in this directory:
/etc/docker/certs.d/ REGISTRY_ADDRESS /
Replace REGISTRY_ADDRESS with the
address
of the machine that runs the private registry.
For more information, see
Verify repository client with certificates .
If your network is behind a proxy server, specify the
proxy server
in the admin cluster configuration file, and
configure Docker to use the proxy server .
If you choose not to enable passwordless sudo, you might need to manually
delete the kind cluster after you create an admin cluster. For more
information, see
Kind cluster does not get deleted
in the troubleshooting documentation.
Install software
Ubuntu
Install the following software:
Docker version 19.03 or later : See
Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu .
Ensure that the non-root user is a member of the docker group. See
Manage Docker as a non-root user .
Google Cloud CLI latest version : See Install the gcloud CLI .
kubectl : Run gcloud components install kubectl , or use apt-get :
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install kubectl
RHEL
Install the following software:
Docker 19.03 or later
Remove any previous Docker version:
sudo dnf remove docker \
docker-client \
docker-client-latest \
docker-common \
docker-latest \
docker-latest-logrotate \
docker-logrotate \
docker-engine
Remove podman-manpages:
sudo dnf remove podman-manpages
Install Docker 19.03+:
sudo dnf install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager \
--add-repo \
https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
sudo dnf install -y --allowerasing docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo systemctl start docker
Verify that you are now running version 19.03+:
sudo docker version
Compare your output with the following example to ensure the Client and
Server versions are 19.03+:
Client: Docker Engine - Community
Version: 19.03.13
...
Server: Docker Engine - Community
Engine:
Version: 19.03.13
Verify Docker runs:
docker run hello-world
You should see something similar to this:
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
Google Cloud CLI latest version :
See Install the gcloud CLI .
kubectl
Run gcloud components install kubectl .
Log in
The Google Account that is set as your
SDK account property
is called your SDK account . The gkectl command-line tool uses your SDK
account to download cluster node OVAs, pull container images and more. So it
is important that you set your SDK account property before you run gkectl
commands.
Log in with any Google Account. This sets your SDK account property:
gcloud auth login
Verify that your SDK account property is set correctly:
gcloud config list
The output shows the values of your SDK account property.
For example:
[core]
account = my-name@google.com
disable_usage_reporting = False
Your active configuration is: [default]
Download gkectl and the bundle
Navigate to a directory where you want to install gkectl .
Download gkectl :
gcloud storage cp gs://gke-on-prem-release/gkectl/ VERSION /gkectl ./
chmod +x gkectl
Replace VERSION with the version of Google Distributed Cloud. For
example: 1.16.0-gke.1 .
Download the Google Distributed Cloud bundle. Make sure the version matches the
one you used to download gkectl :
gcloud storage cp gs://gke-on-prem-release/gke-onprem-bundle/ VERSION /gke-onprem-vsphere- VERSION .tgz ./
Service accounts and keys
Make sure you have created the following required service accounts and JSON
key files:
component access
connect-register
logging-monitoring
Also Make sure you have created any optional service service accounts and JSON
key files that you need:
audit logging
Binary Authorization
Place all of your JSON key files in the home directory of your admin
workstation.
Troubleshooting
The following section re-enables SSH access to the admin workstation in the
event the SSH key is lost or corrupted.
SSH key recovery
Use a temporary VM to perform the following steps:
To generate a new set of SSH keys, follow the instructions in Create SSH
keys in the
Compute Engine documentation.
Verify that the temporary VM and the admin workstation are in a Powered
Off state.
Within vSphere, attach the boot disk of the admin workstation to the
temporary VM.
The boot disk has the label Hard disk 1 .
Mount the boot disk inside the VM by running the following commands:
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot-disk
sudo mount DISK_ID /mnt/boot-disk
Replace DISK_ID with your boot disk identifier, which
should have a format similar to dev/sdc1 .
Edit the authorized_keys file on the boot disk to append the contents of
the public key file generated in the first step:
vi /mnt/boot-disk/.ssh/authorized_keys
Shut down the temporary VM.
Power on the admin workstation.
Use the newly generated private key to access the admin workstation.
ssh -i ~/.ssh/new-admin-ws.key ubuntu@ " ${ ADMIN_WS_IP } "
Use the newly generated private key to continue accessing your admin
workstation.
