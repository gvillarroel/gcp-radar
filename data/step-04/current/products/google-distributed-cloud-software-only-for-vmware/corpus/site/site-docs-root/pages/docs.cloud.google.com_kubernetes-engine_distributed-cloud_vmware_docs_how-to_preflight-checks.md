Running preflight checks
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides information about preflight checks that are run when
you create or upgrade a cluster in Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for
VMware.
Review your firewall rules
In version 1.29 and later, server-side preflight checks are enabled by default
when you create, update, and upgrade clusters. Server-side preflight checks
require additional firewall rules. In
Firewall rules for admin clusters ,
search for "Preflight checks" and make sure all required firewall rules are
configured.
Running gkectl check-config
If you plan to create clusters using gkectl , you run gkectl create-config to
generate a configuration file. The configuration file drives your installation:
you provide information about your vSphere environment, your network and load
balancer, and how you'd like your clusters to look. You're able to generate a
configuration file before or after you've created an admin workstation. For
certain checks to pass, they need to be run from the admin workstation.
After you've modified the file to meet the needs of your environment and your
clusters, you use the file to create your clusters in your on-prem environment.
Before you create clusters using gkectl , run gkectl check-config to
validate the configuration file with several preflight checks.
If the command returns any FAILURE messages, fix the issues
and validate the file again. If a certain feature validation returns any WARNING
messages, you must fix the underlying issues before you can use that feature.
Warning: gkectl check-config should only be used before cluster creation. Running it against an already existing cluster will result in unexpected FAILURE messages. Warning: Some fields in the configuration file have been deprecated. If you run
gkectl check-config against a file that has a deprecated field, the command
might fail. For an example, see this
release note .
Preflight check modes and skipping validations
gkectl check-config has a default mode and a fast mode:
In default mode, the command comprehensively validates each field. Also, the
default mode creates temporary vSphere virtual machines (VMs) as part of
its validations, which can take more time.
In fast mode, the command skips checks that create test VMs and runs only the
fast checks. You enable fast mode by passing in the --fast flag.
You can skip specific validations by passing in other flags, which are described
in gkectl check-config --help .
Traffic between the admin workstation and the test VMs
In default mode, the preflight check creates test VMs for the cluster.
Each test VM runs an HTTP server that listens on port 443 and
on node ports that you specified in your configuration file.
Several IP addresses are assigned to the test VMs. If your configuration file
indicates that your cluster nodes will get their IP addresses from a DHCP
server, then the preflight check uses a DHCP server to assign IP addresses to
the test VMs. If your configuration file indicates that your cluster nodes will
be assigned static IP addresses, then the preflight check assigns static
IP addresses that you specified in your
IP block files
to the test VMs.
The preflight check, running on the admin workstation, sends HTTP requests to
the test VMs using the various IP addresses that are assigned to the VMs.
The requests are sent to port 443 and to the node ports that you specified in
your configuration file.
When should I run preflight checks?
It is a best practice to run preflight checks early and before attempting to
create clusters.
Running preflight checks early can help confirm that you've
configured your vSphere environment and your network correctly.
If you are using version 1.2.0-gke.6, run gkectl check-config twice:
Run gkectl check-config --fast .
Run gkectl prepare .
Run gkectl check-config again, without the --fast flag.
The reason for running twice is that gkectl prepare uploads the VM template for
the cluster node OS image to your vSphere environment. That VM template must be
in place before you run the full set of validations.
In version 1.2.1 and later, the check-config command itself uploads the VM
template, so you can run the full set of validations before you run gkectl
prepare :
Run gkectl check-config , without the --fast flag.
Run gkectl prepare .
The preflight checks validate the values you've provided to the file. You don't
need to fill every field in the configuration file to run preflight checks
against the file; rather, you can validate the file iteratively as you populate
its fields. For example, if you only wanted to validate your vCenter
configuration, you could fill only the vcenter fields and run checks against
those.
Keep in mind that your configuration becomes immutable after you've created your
clusters. Running preflight checks helps you discover and resolve issues in your
configuration before creating your clusters.
Preserving the test VM for debugging
Starting with version 1.2.1, the gkectl check-config command has a --cleanup
flag.
When gkectl check-config performs a full set of validations, it creates a
test VM and an associated SSH key. If you want to preserve the test VM and the
SSH key for debugging purposes, set --cleanup to false.
The default value of --cleanup is true.
List of preflight checks
The preflight checks validate each field in the configuration file. Here are the
current checks:

following unsupported parameters:
hostfailurestotolerate
forceprovisioning
cachereservation
diskstripes
objectspacereservation
iopslimit
diskformat
If your cluster has StorageClasses with any of the preceding
parameters that might mean that you need to migrate your volumes.
For more information, see
Considerations for Migration of In-Tree vSphere Volumes
and the known issues section about upgrades in 1.15 .
Annotations in statically created vSphere in-tree PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaims
Before upgrade, checks annotations in vSphere in-tree PersistentVolumes
and vSphere PersistentVolumeClaims:
The statically created vSphere in-tree PersistentVolumes
have the annotation pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
The statically created vSphere PersistentVolumesClaims
have the annotation volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
and volume.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
If your cluster has vSphere in-tree PersistentVolumes or vSphere PersistentVolumeClaims
without these annotations, you must annotate the PersistentVolumes and
PersistentVolumeClaims before continuing, see
Considerations for Migration of In-Tree vSphere Volumes .
CSI Workload
Validates that the cluster can successfully run a workload
that uses a dynamically provisioned PersistentVolume created
through the vSphere CSI Driver.
This checks runs during upgrade and only if there are
in-tree vSphere volumes and no vSphere CSI Volumes.
This check:
Checks that there are no lingering resources left from
previous runs of the validation.
Finds or creates a StorageClass with the provisioner field set to
the provisioner field set to "csi.vsphere.vmware.com".
In user clusters it selects the CSI StorageClass
standard-rwo .
In admin clusters it finds a StorageClass with the
the provisioner field set to csi.vsphere.vmware.com .
If there's no such StorageClass in the cluster then
the test temporarily creates a new CSI StorageClass and use it in the check.
Creates a PersistentVolumeClaim in the default namespace using
the StorageClass found or created in the previous step and waits for
the dynamically created PersistentVolume to be in the Bound phase.
Creates a writer Job in the default namespace mounting the
PersistentVolume created above. A writer Pod is scheduled and on startup
it writes a string to a file in the mounted filesystem.
Tears down the writer Job and its associated Pod.
Creates a reader Job in the default namespace mounting the
PersistentVolume created above. A reader Pod is scheduled and on startup
it reads the file written by the writer Pod making sure
that the data written by the writer Pod is read successfully.
Tears down the reader Job and its associated Pod.
Tears down the PersistentVolumeClaim, as a result the
PersistentVolume is also deleted.
Tears down the StorageClass if it was created during the test.
Hosts for anti-affinity groups
Validates that the number of physical vCenter hosts is at least
three if antiAffinityGroups is enabled.
To disable antiAffinityGroups for a cluster, see
antiAffinityGroups.enabled
and this
release note .
Skipped with the --skip-validation-infra flag.
Load balancer
Validates load balancing configuration:
If load balancing mode is integrated ( lbmode: Integrated ),
validates that all bigip fields are present in the
admincluster and usercluster specifications.
If load balancing mode is manual ( lbmode: Manual ),
validates that all manuallbspec fields are present in
admincluster and usercluster specifications.
Integrated load balancing
bigip.credentials.[*]
Validates your F5 BIG-IP credentials.
bigip.partition
Validates that the partition provided exists.
F5 BIG-IP user role
Validates that the F5 BIG-IP user provided holds either the
Administrator or Resource Administrator role.
bigip.vips.[*]
Validates VIPs provided.
Skipped with the --fast or
--skip-validation-load-balancer flags.
Manual load balancing
Networking configuration
Validates VIPs, node IPs, etc.
Skipped with the
--fast or --skip-validation-load-balancer
flags.
[*].manuallbspec.[*]
Validates the provided node ports.
Skipped with the --skip-validation-load-balancer flag.
Networking
Validates that the provided CIDR ranges, VIPs, and static IPs (if
configured) are available. Checks that IP addresses don't overlap.
Skipped with the --skip-validation-net-config flag.
DNS
Validates that the provided DNS server is available.
Skipped with the --skip-validation-dns flag.
NTP
Validates that the provided Network Time Protocol (NTP) server is available.
Skipped with the --skip-validation-tod flag.
VIPs
Pings the VIPs provided. This check is successful if the ping fails,
indicating the expected VIP is not already taken.
Skipped with the
--skip-validation-vips flag.
Node IPs
Pings the node IP addresses provided. This check is successful if the
ping fails, indicating the expected node IP is not already taken.
Skipped with the
--skip-validation-node-ips flag.
Preflight check results
Preflight checks can return the following results:
SUCCESS
The field and its value passed the check.
FAILURE
The field and/or its value did not pass the check. If a check returns a
FAILURE message, fix the issues and validate the file again.
SKIPPED
The check was skipped, likely because the check is not relevant to your
configuration. For example, if you are using a DHCP server, checks for
DNS and node IPs checks—relevant only to a static IP configuration—are skipped.
If you pass in a flag that skips a validation, the skipped check does not
return a SKIPPED result; rather, the validation isn't run and doesn't appear
in the command output at all.
UNKNOWN
The skip returned a non-zero code. You can consider UNKNOWN results to be
failed checks. UNKNOWN usually indicates that the check failed to run some
system package, such as failing to run nslookup or failing to run gcloud.
Coming soon
The following preflight checks will be added in a future release:
NTP server
Running preflight checks
You run preflight checks by running the following command:
gkectl check-config --config [CONFIG]
where [CONFIG] is the path to your configuration file
Running in fast mode
If you prefer, you can run preflight checks in "fast mode," which skips the
validations that create temporary test VMs, such as the load balancing VIP and
node IP validations. To do so, pass in --fast :
gkectl check-config --config [CONFIG] --fast
Skipping specific validations
You can pass in flags to granularly skip specific validations, such as DNS,
proxy, and networking. Each skip flag is prefixed with --skip-[VALIDATION] .
To learn about the available skip flags, run the following command:
gkectl check-config --help
For example, to skip the load balancer validations:
gkectl check-config --config my-config.yaml --skip-validation-load-balancer
Cancelling preflight checks
If you started running preflight checks and want to cancel, press CTRL + C
twice. If a preflight check created a test VM, cancelling should also clean up
the VM automatically.
Cleaning up a test VM
If a test VM is leftover after preflight checks are complete, you can delete the
VM from vCenter. A test VM has a name like this:
check-config-[dhcp|static]-[random number]
To delete the VM:
Right-click the VM, and click Power > Power Off
After the VM has powered off, right-click the VM again, and click Delete
from Disk .

Known issues
For version 1.3.0-gke.16:
You must run fast validation checks, gkectl check-config --fast , for your
preflight checks if both of the following apply:
You configured Google Distributed Cloud to use a proxy.
You installed one of the following bundles:
The /var/lib/gke/bundles/gke-onprem-vsphere-1.3.0-gke.16.tgz
bundle from the Downloads page.
The /var/lib/gke/bundles/gke-onprem-vsphere-1.3.0-gke.16.tgz
bundle from the admin workstation.
You can run full set of validation only if you installed the
full bundle. For example:
/var/lib/gke/bundles/gke-onprem-vsphere-1.3.0-gke.16-full.tgz
For version 1.2.0-gke.6:
If you are using nested resource pools or the default resource pool,
gkectl check-config fails when you attempt to do a full set of validations.
However, you can do a smaller set of validations by passing the --fast flag.
gkectl check-config --config [CONFIG] --fast
