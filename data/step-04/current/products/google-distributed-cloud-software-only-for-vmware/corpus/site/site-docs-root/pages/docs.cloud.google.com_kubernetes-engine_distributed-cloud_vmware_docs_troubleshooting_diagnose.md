Diagnose cluster issues
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The gkectl tool has two commands for troubleshooting issues with clusters:
gkectl diagnose cluster and gkectl diagnose snapshot . The commands work
with both admin and user clusters. This document shows how to use the
gkectl diagnose command to diagnose issues in your clusters.
Note the following limitation with advanced clusters:
Version 1.31: the gkectl diagnose commands aren't supported on
advanced clusters .
Version 1.32 and higher: the gkectl diagnose commands are supported on
advanced clusters.
For more information how to use the gkectl diagnose snapshot command to
create snapshots that can help Cloud Customer Care diagnose issues, see
Create snapshots to diagnose clusters .
Tip: After running a gkectl diagnose command, use
Gemini Cloud Assist
( Preview ) to help you understand the output.
For example, you can paste the generated report or specific error messages into
Gemini Cloud Assist, and ask it to explain the potential causes
of any issues and recommend next steps.
gkectl diagnose cluster
This command performs health checks on your cluster and reports errors. The
command runs health checks on the following components:
vCenter
Credential
DRS
Anti-affinity groups
Network
Version
Datacenter
Datastore
ResourcePool
Folder
Network
Load balancer (F5, Seesaw, or Manual)
User cluster and node pools
Cluster objects
Konnectivity server readiness of the user cluster
Machine objects and the corresponding cluster nodes
Pods in the kube-system and gke-system namespaces
Control plane
vSphere persistent volumes in the cluster
User and admin cluster vCPU (virtual CPU) and memory contention signals
User and admin cluster ESXi
preconfigured Host CPU Usage and Memory Usage alarms .
Time of day (TOD)
Node network policy for a cluster with Dataplane V2 enabled
Overall healthiness of the Dataplane V2 node agent
Diagnose an admin cluster
To diagnose an admin cluster, specify the path to your admin cluster:
gkectl diagnose cluster --kubeconfig= ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
Replace ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG with the path of
your admin cluster kubeconfig file.
The following example output is returned from the gkectl diagnose cluster
command:
Preparing for the diagnose tool ...

Cluster is healthy !
If there's an issue with a virtual IP address (VIP) in the target cluster,
use the --config flag to provide the admin cluster configuration file to
provide more debugging information.
gkectl diagnose cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG --config CLUSTER_CONFIG
Replace CLUSTER_CONFIG with the path of the admin
or user cluster configuration file.
Note: Always set --kubeconfig to the path of the admin cluster kubeconfig
file, regardless of whether you are diagnosing an admin or user cluster.
The following example output shows that the gkectl diagnose cluster command
can now correctly connect to the cluster and check for issues:
Failed to access the api server via LB VIP "..." : ...

Diagnose a user cluster
To diagnose a user cluster, you must specify the user cluster name. If you need
to get the name of a user cluster, run the following command:
kubectl get cluster --kubeconfig= USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
Replace USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG with the path of
the user cluster kubeconfig file.
Specify the name of the user cluster along with the config file as follows:
gkectl diagnose cluster --kubeconfig= ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG \
--cluster-name= USER_CLUSTER_NAME
Replace USER_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of the user
cluster.
The following example output is returned from the gkectl diagnose cluster
command:

Diagnose virtual machine status
If an issue arises with virtual machine creation, run gkectl diagnose cluster
to obtain a diagnosis of the virtual machine status.
The output is similar to the following:
- Validation Category: Cluster Healthiness
Checking cluster object...SUCCESS
Checking machine deployment...SUCCESS
Checking machineset...SUCCESS
Checking machine objects...SUCCESS
Checking machine VMs...FAILURE
Reason: 1 machine VMs error(s).
Unhealthy Resources:
Machine [NODE_NAME]: The VM's UUID "420fbe5c-4c8b-705a-8a05-ec636406f60" does not match the machine object's providerID "420fbe5c-4c8b-705a-8a05-ec636406f60e".
Debug Information:
null
...
Exit with error:
Cluster is unhealthy!
Run gkectl diagnose cluster automatically in gkectl diagnose snapshot

Troubleshoot
The following table outlines some possible resolutions for problems with running
the gkectl diagnose cluster command:
Issue Possible causes Resolution
Kubernetes API server is not reachable, either for the admin cluster, or for user clusters.
Check the virtual machine health OOB (out-of-box) memory latency graphs, which ideally should have a memory latency around zero. Memory contention can also increase CPU contention, and the CPU readiness graphs might have a spike as there will be swapping involved.
Increase physical memory. For other options, see VMware troubleshooting suggestions .
Nodepool creation times out.
VMDK high read/write latency. Check VM health OOB for virtual disk read and write latency. According to VMware, a total latency greater than 20ms indicates a problem.
See VMware solutions for disk performance problems .
BundleUnexpectedDiff error
The Kubernetes Cluster API resource managed by a Google Distributed Cloud bundle
might be accidentally modified which can cause failure of system components, or
cluster upgrade or update failure.
In Google Distributed Cloud version 1.13 and later, the
onprem-user-cluster-controller periodically checks the status of objects, and
reports any unexpected differences from the desired state through logs and
events. These objects include the user cluster control plane and add-ons such as
Services and DaemonSets.
The following example output shows an unexpected difference event:
Type Reason Age From Message
---- ------ ---- ---- -------
Warning BundleUnexpectedDiff 13m onpremusercluster/ci-bundle-diff Detected unexpected difference of user control plane objects: [ConfigMap/istio], please check onprem-user-cluster-controller logs for more details.
The following example output shows logs generated by the
onprem-user-cluster-controller :

2022 - 08 - 06 T02 : 54 : 42.701462434 Z }
The events and logs won't block cluster operation. Objects that have
unexpected differences from their desired state are overwritten in the next
cluster upgrade.
