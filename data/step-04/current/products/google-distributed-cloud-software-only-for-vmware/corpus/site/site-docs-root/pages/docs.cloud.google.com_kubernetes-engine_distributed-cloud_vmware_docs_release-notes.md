Fixed
The following issues were fixed in 1.33.600-gke.40:
Fixed an issue where if updates or upgrades to advanced admin clusters failed and the external bootstrap cluster was deleted, you could lose critical data.
Fixed
The following issues were fixed in 1.32.1000-gke.57:
Fixed an issue where the node-problem-detector was incorrectly deployed onto
non-Advanced (V1) VMware clusters, causing the containerd runtime to
continuously restart on affected nodes, leading to ETCD/CRI failures and
unsuccessful cluster upgrades.
Fixed an issue where setting the deprecated stackdriver.enableVPC field to
true in a cluster configuration file would block upgrades to an Advanced
Cluster. The stackdriver.enableVPC field has been deprecated and its setting is
now ignored during the upgrade validation process.
Fixes an issue where Advanced Clusters incorrectly deployed the node problem
detector onto non-Advanced clusters, which caused containerd to continuously
restart and led to cluster upgrade failures.
Fixed an issue where the system certificate pool was ignored when a custom CA
certificate was configured for a registry mirror.
Fixed an issue where retrying the gkectl upgrade admin command after a
previous failure could fail with "AlreadyExists" errors in the bootstrap cluster.
Fixed an issue where cluster creation or upgrade failed if the proxy or
noProxy configuration fields contained extraneous whitespaces. These spaces
interfered with internal command-line argument parsing, causing the control
plane load balancer initialization to fail.
Fixed an issue where if updates or upgrades to advanced admin clusters failed
and the external bootstrap cluster was deleted, you could lose critical data.

Change
Important: Mandatory flag for admin cluster upgrades
If an update or upgrade to advanced admin clusters fails in versions 1.32 and newer, don't delete the external bootstrap cluster from the workstation. The bootstrap cluster contains required information about states that you need to resume the update or upgrade. If an update or upgrade to admin clusters fails, and you re-run gkectl upgrade admin , you must add the flag --reuse-bootstrap-cluster or you can lose critical data.

Fixed
The following issues were fixed in 1.34.200-gke.68:
Fixed vulnerabilities listed in Vulnerability fixes .
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware V2 (Advanced Clusters) versions 1.31
and earlier were missing a configuration step in the node startup script that
defined the Docker default bridge IP range. As a result, Docker defaulted to
using the 172.17.0.0/16 (and in some cases 172.16.0.0/16) address range.
Fixed an issue where an admin cluster upgrade appeared to be stuck indefinitely
and users would see the VSphereMachine remaining in the Creating phase
without actionable error messages.

Change
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware V2 (Advanced Clusters) versions 1.31
and earlier were missing a configuration step in the node startup script that
defined the Docker default bridge IP range. As a result, Docker defaulted to
using the 172.17.0.0/16 (and in some cases 172.16.0.0/16) address range.
If this default range overlaps with customer network infrastructure,
connectivity failures during cluster creation or operation can occur.
This issue has been resolved. The Docker default bridge IP for cluster nodes in
advanced clusters is now explicitly set to 169.254.123.1/24.

non-advanced cluster from version 1.33 to 1.34, the cluster is automatically
converted to an advanced cluster. If you use custom code that depends on the
non-advanced cluster configuration, this can be a breaking change. For more
information, see
Key differences after moving to advanced clusters .

Change
GA: Changed the cluster creation process so that all new clusters are advanced clusters .
Clusters are automatically converted to advanced clusters when you upgrade to
version 1.33.
You must use the gkectl command line tool to upgrade non-advanced clusters
to version 1.33. The GKE On-Prem API clients, Terraform, the
Google Cloud console, and the gcloud CLI, aren't supported.
Upgraded the etcd component to version 3.4.33.
Feature
GA: Enabled the vsphere-metrics-exporter component for advanced clusters. This exporter provides greater visibility into the VMware vSphere environment by collecting key performance and health metrics.
GA: Added support for VM-Host affinity groups in advanced clusters. This feature allows for the creation of rules that constrain cluster nodes to run on specific, predefined groups of hosts.
GA: Added support for automatic node resizing in advanced clusters. This feature optimizes resource use by automatically adjusting the CPU and memory allocated to control plane nodes in response to workload demands.
Public Preview: Added support for Virtual Machine (VM) tracking using vSphere
tags in advanced clusters. This feature simplifies resource management by
automatically applying identifying tags to cluster VMs.
GA: Introduced an Envoy proxy sidecar to the GKE Identity Service for clusters
that use Controlplane V2. This change enhances the security, reliability, and
performance of the authentication service.

Announcement
The original 1.31.0-gke.889 release notes stated incorrectly that the GKE Identity Service allows TLS 1.1 and higher connections, by default. Here is the correct change description:
GKE Identity Service now requires that all HTTPS connections use transport layer security (TLS) 1.2 or 1.3. For versions 1.31.0 and higher, TLS 1.1 is disabled by default, however it can be re-enabled if needed.
If you require support for TLS 1.1, reach out to Cloud Customer Care for assistance.
The 1.31.0-gke.889 release notes have been updated to reflect the correct default behavior.
December 18, 2024
Announcement
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware 1.31.0-gke.889 is now
available for
download .
To upgrade, see Upgrade a cluster or a node
pool .
Google Distributed Cloud 1.31.0-gke.889 runs on Kubernetes v1.31.3-gke.100.
If you are using a third-party storage vendor, check the GDC Ready storage
partners
document to make sure the storage vendor has already passed the qualification
for this release.
After a release, it takes approximately 7 to 14 days for the version to become
available for use with GKE On-Prem API
clients :
the Google Cloud console, the gcloud CLI, and Terraform.
Feature
Announcing an early look at two preview features:
A new architecture called advanced
clusters . When advanced cluster is enabled, the underlying Google Distributed Cloud software deploys controllers that allow for a more extensible architecture. Enabling advanced clusters gives you access to new features and capabilities, such as topology domains.
A topology domain is a pool of cluster nodes that are considered to be part of the same logical or physical grouping. Topology domains correspond to some underlying hardware or software that has the possibility of correlated failure, like networking equipment in a rack. As part of setting up a topology domain, you create a topology label that is set on all the nodes in the topology domain during cluster creation. This label lets you set up Pod Topology Spread Constraints .
Note the following limitations of the preview:
You can enable the features only on new 1.31 clusters.
You won't be able to upgrade the clusters to 1.32, so only enable the features in a test environment.
To test topology domains, we recommend that you configure the
cluster-wide built-in default spread constraints because configuring your own
cluster-wide spread constraints isn't available.
Change
Upgrade changes:
Dataplane V2 is required for all user clusters. Before upgrading a user
cluster to 1.31, follow the steps in Enable Dataplane
V2 .
To upgrade clusters to 1.31, you must upgrade your admin cluster first and
then user clusters. For more information, see Version
rules .
Version changes:
COS was upgraded to milestone
113 .
Other changes:
(Edited: January 7, 2025) GKE Identity Service now requires that all HTTPS connections use transport layer security (TLS) 1.2 or 1.3. For versions 1.31.0 and higher, TLS 1.1 is disabled by default, however it can be re-enabled if needed.
If you require support for TLS 1.1, reach out to Cloud Customer Care for assistance.
Removed TLS/SSL weak message authentication code cipher suites in the vSphere
cloud controller manager.
Fixed
The following issues are fixed in 1.31.0-gke.889:
Fixed the issue that additional manual steps are needed after disabling
always-on secrets encryption with gkectl update cluster .
Fixed the known
issue
that caused migrating a user cluster to Controlplane V2 to fail if secrets
encryption has ever been enabled on the user cluster, even if it's already
disabled.
Fixed the known
issue
where the gkectl upgrade command returned an incorrect error about the
netapp storageclass.
Fixed the known
issue
where updating DataplaneV2 ForwardMode doesn't automatically trigger anetd
DaemonSet restart.

Announcement
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware 1.30.0-gke.1930 is now
available for
download .
To upgrade, see
Upgrade a cluster or a node pool .
Google Distributed Cloud 1.30.0-gke.1930 runs on Kubernetes v1.30.3-gke.200.
If you are using a third-party storage vendor, check the
GDCV Ready storage partners
document to make sure the storage vendor has already passed the qualification
for this release.
After a release, it takes approximately 7 to 14 days for the version to become
available for installations or upgrades with the
GKE On-Prem API clients :
the Google Cloud console, the gcloud CLI, and Terraform.
Feature
GA:
StatefulSet CSI Migration Tool
GA:
Migrate clusters to use recommended features
Preview: The gcloud beta container fleet memberships get-credentials
command uses a preview feature of the Connect gateway that lets you run the
kubectl attach , cp , and exec commands. For more information, see
Limitations
in the Connect gateway documentation.
Breaking
For admin and user clusters created at 1.30 and later versions,
loadBalancer.Kind needs to be set to either MetalLB or ManualLB .
For user clusters created at 1.30 and later versions,
enableControlplaneV2 needs to be set to true .
The featureGates.GMPForSystemMetrics field in the stackdriver CR is
now always on and can't be disabled. It has been default on since 1.16. If
you have manually turned it off, this upgrade means a breaking change in
some system metrics format. For information on changing this field, see
Enabling and disabling Managed Service for Prometheus . The field name in this note is incorrect, it should be enableGMPForSystemMetrics , instead of GMPForSystemMetrics ; see updated entry for March 25, 2025 .
Change
Version changes in 1.30.0-gke.1930:
Existing Seesaw load balancers now require TLS 1.2.
COS was upgraded to m109
Updated Dataplane V2 to use Cilium 1.13
Other changes in1.30.0-gke.1930:
Enhanced the upgrade process to include an automatic pre-upgrade
check. Before you upgrade your admin or user cluster, the system runs this
check to detect known issues. The check also provides guidance to ensure a
smooth upgrade experience.
Ingress node ports are optional for ControlplaneV2 clusters.
Admin clusters created in 1.30 will use Dataplane V2, Google's Container
Network Interface (CNI) implementation, which is based on
Cilium .
Admin clusters upgraded to 1.30 from 1.29 will use Dataplane V2.
Removed mTLS on system metrics scrape endpoints, which makes it easier
to integrate with 3rd party monitoring systems.
Stopped bundling cert-manager and removed the monitoring-operator
because system components no longer depend on them. Cert-manager from
existing 1.29 clusters will continue running, but stop being managed by
Google after upgrading to 1.30. If you don't use cert-manager, you can
delete cert-manager after upgrade. New clusters in 1.30 and higher won't
come with cert-manager. If you rely on the bundled cert-manager for their
own use case, you should install their own in new clusters.
We recommend that you don't use the preview feature
usage metering when you create new clusters. However, existing clusters using this feature will continue to function. As the alternative, we recommend that you use the predefined dashboard, Anthos Cluster Utilization Metering , to understand resource usage at different levels.
Fixed
​​The following issues were fixed in 1.30.0-gke.1930:
Fixed the
known issue
where cluster creation failed due to the control plane VIP in a different
subnet.
Fixed the
known issue where
a user cluster with Binary Authorization failed to come up.
Fixed the
known issue
that caused the Connect Agent to lose connection to Google Cloud after a
non-HA to HA admin cluster migration.
Fixed the
known issue
where the admin cluster upgrade failed for clusters created on versions
1.10 or earlier.
Fixed the
known issue
where the Docker bridge IP used 172.17.0.1/16 for COS cluster control plane
nodes.
Fixed the
known issue
where the HA admin cluster installation preflight check reported the wrong
number of required static IPs.
Fixed the
known issue
that caused multiple network interfaces with the standard CNI didn't work.
Fixed a gkeadm preflight check that wasn't validating the VM folder.

Announcement
GKE on VMware 1.29.0-gke.1456 is now available. To upgrade, see
Upgrade a cluster or a node pool .
GKE on VMware 1.29.0-gke.1456 runs on Kubernetes v1.29.3-gke.600.
If you are using a third-party storage vendor, check the
GDCV Ready storage partners
document to make sure the storage vendor has already passed the qualification
for this release of GKE on VMware.
Feature
Preview : Support
migrating a vSphere datastore to SPBM .
Preview : Support
migrating the configuration for integrated F5 BIG-IP to manual load balancing mode .
Preview : Support
migrating a user cluster to Controlplane V2 .
Preview : Support
migrating a non-HA admin cluster to HA .
GA : Support
migrating disks from one vSphere datastore to another vSphere datastore with SPBM .
GA : Support updating multiple service account keys together with
gkectl update credentials .
GA : A user cluster control plane can be
two minor versions later
than its node pools and admin cluster.
GA : Support for
cgroupv2 Linux images for cluster nodes.
GA : Support
GKE Identity Service v2 capability
for an improved security flow when you authenticate with third-party identity solutions.
Warning : GKE Identity Service v2 requires ports 11001 and 11002 on the user cluster control plane nodes. Ensure these ports are open and available before you upgrade a cluster to version 1.29.0-gke.1456 and higher.
Breaking
Server-side preflight checks are enabled by default for admin and user cluster
create, update, and upgrade. Server-side preflight checks require the following
additional firewall rules from your admin cluster control-plane nodes:
Admin cluster F5 BIG_IP API (only if using the F5 BIG-IP load balancer)
User cluster F5 BIG_IP API (only if using the F5 BIG-IP load balancer)
Admin cluster NTP servers
User cluster NTP servers
Admin cluster DNS servers
User cluster DNS servers
User cluster on-premises local Docker registry (if your user cluster is
configured to use a local private Docker registry instead of gcr.io )
Admin cluster nodes
User cluster nodes
Admin cluster Load Balancer VIPs
User cluster Load Balancer VIPs
User cluster worker nodes
For the complete list of firewall rules required for server-side preflight
checks, see
Firewall rules for admin clusters
and search for "Preflight checks".
Change
Version changes in GKE on VMware 1.29.0-gke.1456:
Updated Dataplane V2 to use Cilium 1.13.
Bumped the AIS version to hybrid_identity_charon_20240331_0730_RC00.
Other changes in GKE on VMware 1.29.0-gke.1456:
The gkectl create cluster command prompts for confirmation if the
cluster configuration file enables legacy features.
The gkectl prepare command always prepares cgroup v2 images.
Cluster configuration files are prepopulated with ubuntu_cgv2
(cgroupv2) as the osImageType .
The gkeadm tool isn't supported on macOS and Windows.
A lightweight version of
gkectl diagnose snapshot
is available for both admin and user clusters.
User cluster upgrades: the --dry-run flag for gkectl upgrade cluster
runs preflight checks but doesn't doesn't start the upgrade process.
The --async flag for gkectl upgrade cluster to run an asynchronous
upgrade is now supported for admin clusters
Fixed
The following issues are fixed in 1.29.0-gke.1456:
Fixed the issue where the admin cluster backup did a retry on
non-idempotent operations.
Fixed the
known issue
where the controlPlaneNodePort field defaults to 30968 when the
manualLB spec is empty`
Fixed the
known issue
that caused the preflight check to fail when the hostname wasn't in the IP
block file.
Fixed the
known issue
that caused Kubelet to be flooded with logs stating that
"/etc/kubernetes/manifests" does not exist on the worker nodes.
Fixed the manual load balancer issue where the IngressIP is overwritten
with the Spec.LoadBalancerIP even if it is empty.
Fixed the issue that preflight jobs might be stuck in the pending state.
Fixed an issue where egress NAT erroneously broke long-lived connections.
Fixed Seesaw crashing on duplicated service IP.
Fixed a warning in the storage preflight check.

Announcement
GKE on VMware, formerly Anthos clusters on VMware, is a component of Google
Distributed Cloud Virtual, software that brings
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
to on-premises data centers. We are in the process of updating documentation and the Google Cloud Console UI with the new name.
GKE on VMware 1.28.0-gke.651 is now available. GKE on VMware 1.28.0-gke.651
runs on Kubernetes v1.28.3-gke.700. To upgrade, see
Upgrading GKE on VMware clusters .
For easier identification of the Kubernetes version for a given release, we are
aligning GKE on VMware version numbering with GKE version numbering.
This change starts with the December 2023 minor release, which is version 1.28.
Additionally, GKE on VMware patch versions ( z in the semantic version
numbering scheme x.y.z-gke.N ) will increment by 100.
Example version numbers for GKE on VMware:
Minor release: 1.28.0-gke.651
First patch release (example): 1.28.100-gke.27
Second patch release (example): 1.28.200-gke.19
This change affects numbering only. Upgrades from 1.16 to 1.28 follow the same
process as upgrades between prior minor releases.
If you use a third-party storage vendor, check the GDCV Ready storage partners document to make sure the storage vendor has already passed the qualification for this release of GKE on VMware.
Change
Version changes in GKE on VMware 1.28.0-gke.651:
Bumped etcd to version v3.4.27-0-gke.1.
Bumped istio-ingress to version 1.19.3.
Bumped the AIS version to hybrid_identity_charon_20230830_0730_RC00.
Other changes in GKE on VMware 1.28.0-gke.651:
Creating non-HA admin clusters isn't allowed. New admin clusters are required to be highly available. Non-HA admin clusters have 1 control plane node and 2 add-on nodes. An HA admin cluster has 3 control plane nodes with no add-on nodes, so the number of VMs that a new admin cluster requires hasn't changed.
HA admin clusters now have a long running controller to perform
reconciliation periodically.
The command gkectl repair admin-master --restore-from-backup now
supports restoration of etcd data for HA admin clusters.
When upgrading user clusters to version 1.28, we validate all changes
made in the configuration file, and return an error for unsupported
changes. See
Remove unsupported changes to unblock upgrade .
The vSphere cloud controller manager is enabled in Controlplane V2 user
clusters.
We now always write the local k8s audit log file, even when Cloud audit
logging is enabled. This allows for easier third party logging system
integration.
MetalLB will be the default load balancer for 1.29 user and admin
clusters. The ability to use Seesaw as a load balancer will be removed
with 1.29. We recommend migrating to the MetalLB load-balancer. Upgrades
from existing Seesaw clusters will continue to work for a few more releases.
The loadBalancer.manualLB.addonsNodePort field is deprecated. The
field was used for the in-cluster Prometheus and Grafana add-ons, which was
deprecated in version 1.16.
The loadBalancer.vips.addonsVIP field is deprecated. The field was
used for the in-cluster Prometheus and Grafana add-ons, which was
deprecated in version 1.16.
yq is no longer pre-installed on the admin workstation.
Control-plane nodes now have the
node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane taint.
In-tree GlusterFS is removed from Kuberentes 1.27. Add storage
validation to detect in-tree GlusterFS volumes.
Metrics data are now gzip compressed when they are sent to Cloud monitoring.
Breaking
Breaking changes in GKE on VMware 1.28.0-gke.651:
Cloud Monitoring now requires projects to enable the
kubernetesmetadata.googleapis.com API and grant the
kubernetesmetadata.publisher IAM role to the
logging-monitoring service account .
This applies to both creating new 1.28 clusters and upgrading existing clusters
to 1.28. If your organization has set up an
allowlist
that lets traffic from Google APIs and other addresses pass through your proxy server, add
kubernetesmetadata.googleapis.com to the allowlist.
The admin workstation must have at least 100 GB of disk space. If you are
upgrading to 1.28, check the adminWorkstation.diskGB field in the
admin workstation configuration file and make sure that the specified size is at least 100.
Fixed
The following issues are fixed in 1.28.0-gke.651:
Fixed an issue where disable_bundled_ingress failed user cluster load balancer validation.
Fixed an issue where the cluster-health-controller sometimes leaked
vSphere sessions.
Fixed an etcd hostname mismatch issue when using FQDN.
Fixed a
known issue
where admin cluster update or upgrade failed if the projects or locations
of add-on services didn't match each other.
Fixed a
known issue
where the CSI workload preflight check failed due to a Pod startup failure.
Fixed an issue where deleting a user cluster with a volume attached
might get stuck.
Fixed a
known issue
where deleting a Controlplane V2 user cluster might get stuck.
Fixed a logrotate error on the ubuntu_containerd image.
Fixed a disk full issue on Seesaw VMs due to no log rotation for fluent-bit.
Fixed a
known issue
where Seesaw didn't set the target IP in GARP replies.
Fixed a flaky SSH error on non-HA admin control-plane nodes after
update/upgrade.

Issue
Upgrading an admin cluster with always-on secrets encryption enabled might fail.
An admin cluster upgrade from 1.14.x to 1.15.0 - 1.15.4 with always-on secrets encryption enabled might fail depending on whether the feature was enabled during cluster creation or during cluster update.
We recommend that you don't upgrade your admin cluster until a fix is available in 1.15.5. If you must upgrade to 1.15.0-1.15.4, do the steps in
Preventing the upgrade failure before upgrading the cluster.
For information on working around an admin cluster failure because of this issue, see
Upgrading an admin cluster with always-on secrets encryption enabled fails . Note that the workaround relies on you having the old encryption key backed up. If the old key is no longer available, you will have to recreate the admin cluster and all user clusters.

has been updated to provide a summary that customers can copy and paste when opening support cases.
In-tree GlusterFS is removed from Kuberentes 1.27. Add storage
validation to detect in-tree glusterFS volumes.
Metrics data are now gzip compressed when sending to Cloud Monitoring.
The stackdriver-log-forwarder (fluent-bit) now sends logs to Cloud
Logging with gzip compression to reduce egress bandwidth needed.
Prometheus and Grafana are no longer bundled for in-cluster monitoring
and they are replaced with Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus.
The following flags in the
stackdriver custom resource
are deprecated and changes to their values aren't honored:

Connect Agent after an upgrade to 1.15.
Fixed the
known issue
of Cloud Audit Logging failure due to permission denied.
Fixed a
known issue
where the update operation cannot be fulfilled due to KSA signing key
version unmatched.
Fixed a
known issue
where $ in the private registry username caused admin control plane machine
startup failure.

journalctl commands running on the cluster nodes when you take a cluster
snapshot with the --log-since flag.
Fixed a
known issue
where node ID verification failed to handle hostnames with dots.
Fixed continuous increase of logging agent memory.
Fixed the issue that caused gcloud to fail to update the platform when
the required-platform-version is already the current platform version.
Fixed an issue where cluster-api-controllers in a high-availability
admin cluster had no Pod anti-affinity. This could allow the three
clusterapi-controllers Pods not to be scheduled on different
control-plane nodes.
Fixed the wrong admin cluster resource link annotation key that can
cause the cluster to be enrolled again by mistake.
Fixed a
known issue
where node pool creation failed because of duplicated VM-Host affinity rules.
The preflight check for StorageClass parameter validations now throws a
warning instead of a failure on ignored parameters after CSI Migration.
StorageClass parameter diskformat=thin is now allowed and does not
generate a warning.
Fixed a false error message for gkectl prepare when using a
high-availability admin cluster.
Fixed an issue during the migration from the Seesaw load balancer to
MetalLB that caused 'DeprecatedKubeception' always shows up in the diff.

Security bulletin
A new vulnerability, CVE-2023-0468, has been discovered in the Linux kernel that could allow an unprivileged user to escalate privileges to root when io_poll_get_ownership will keep increasing req->poll_refs on every io_poll_wake then overflow to 0 which will fput req->file twice and cause a struct file refcount issue. GKE clusters, including Autopilot clusters, with Container-Optimized OS using Linux Kernel version 5.15 are affected. GKE clusters using Ubuntu images or using GKE Sandbox are unaffected.

Issue
Known issue
If you create a version 1.13.8 or version 1.14.4 admin cluster, or upgrade an admin cluster to version 1.13.8 or 1.14.4, the kind cluster pulls the following container images from docker.io :
docker.io/kindest/kindnetd
docker.io/kindest/local-path-provisioner
docker.io/kindest/local-path-helper
If docker.io isn't accessible from your admin workstation, the admin cluster creation or upgrade fails to bring up the kind cluster.
This issue affects the following versions of Anthos clusters on VMware:
1.14.4
1.13.8

Breaking
CSI migration for the vSphere storage driver is enabled by default. A new storage preflight check and a new CSI workload preflight check verify that PersistentVolumes that used the old in-tree vSphere storage driver will continue to work with the vSphere CSI driver. There is a known issue during admin cluster upgrade. If you see a preflight check about a StorageClass diskformat parameter, you can use --skip-validation-cluster-health to skip the check. This issue will be fixed in a future release.
The minimum required version of vCenter and ESXi is 7.0 Update 2.
Change
Admin cluster update operations are now managed by an admin cluster controller.
The Connect Agent now runs in high availability mode.
The metrics server now runs in high-availability mode.
Upgraded the VMware vSphere Container Storage Plug-in from 2.7 to 3.0. This includes support for Kubernetes version 1.26. For more information, see the plug-in release notes .
Upgraded Anthos Identity Service to hybrid_identity_charon_20230313_0730_RC00.
Switched the node selector from node-role.kubernetes.io/master to node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane and added toleration node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane to system components.
Controlplane V2 is now the default for new user clusters.
Now when you delete a Controlplane V2 user cluster , the data disk is automatically deleted.
Cluster DNS now supports ordering policy for upstream servers.
Added admin cluster CA certificate validation to the admin cluster upgrade preflight check.
Upgraded Anthos Network Gateway to 1.4.4.
Updated anthos-multinet .
When you upload and share a snapshot using gkectl diagnose snapshot with a Google Support team service account service-[GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER]@gcp-sa-anthossupport.iam.gserviceaccount.com , gkectl helps provision the service account automatically.
Upgraded node-exporter from 1.0.1 to 1.4.1.
Upgraded Managed Service for Prometheus for application metrics from 0.4 to 0.6.
We now allow storage DRS to be enabled in manual mode.
GKE connect is now required for admin clusters, and you cannot skip the corresponding validation. You can register existing admin clusters by using gkectl update admin .
We no longer silently skip saving empty files in diagnose snapshots, but instead collect the names of those files in a new empty_snapshots file in the snapshot tarball.
We now mount /opt/data using disk label data .
In the vSphere CSI driver, enabled improved-csi-idempotency and async-query-volume , and disabled trigger-csi-fullsync . This enhances the vSphere CSI driver to ensure volume operations are idempotent.
Changed the relative file path fields in the admin cluster configuration file to use absolute paths
Removed kubectl describe events in cluster snapshots for a better user experience. kubectl describe events fail when the target event expires. In contrast kubectl get events survive and provide enough debugging information.
Change
Deprecations
Support for gkeadm on MAC and Windows is deprecated.
The enableWindowsDataplaneV2 field in the user cluster configuration file is deprecated.
The gkectl enroll cluster command is deprecated. Use gcloud to enroll a user cluster instead.

December 21, 2022
Change
Upgraded Kubernetes from 1.24 to 1.25:
Migrated PDB API version from policy/v1beta1 to policy/v1. You must ensure that any workload PDB API version is updated to policy/v1 before upgrading your cluster to 1.14.0.
Migrated autoscaling/v2beta1 to autoscaling/v2.
Disabled CSI Migration for vSphere as this is enabled by default in Kubernetes 1.25.
Added storage validation that checks if in-use Kubernetes PersistentVolumes (PV) have disks present in the configured datastore, and if node.Status.VolumesAttached is consistent with the actual PV/disk attachment states during admin and user cluster upgrade preflight checks.
Updated gcloud version to 410.0.0 on the admin workstation.
Upgraded VMware vSphere Container Storage Plug-in from 2.5 to 2.7. This version bump includes support for Kubernetes version 1.25. For more information, see VMware vSphere Container Storage Plug-in 2.7 Release Notes .
In the generated user cluster configuration template, the prepopulated value for enableDataplaneV2 is now true .
Removed unnecessary RBAC policies for managing the lifecycle of user clusters in the Google Cloud console.
Updated the parser of container logs to extract severity level.
Simplified the cluster snapshot uploading process by automatically retrieving GKE connect-register service account key, and making the flag --service-account-key-file optional. When the cluster is not registered correctly, and no additional service account key file is passed in through the flag, the gkectl diagnose snapshot command will use the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to authenticate the request.
Upgraded Container-Optimized OS to m101 .
In the admin cluster and user cluster configuration file templates, loadbalancer.kind field is now prepopulated with MetalLB .
Feature
Support for user cluster creation with Controlplane V2 enabled is now generally available. For more details on how to create a user cluster with this model, see Create a user cluster with Controlplane V2 .
Preview : You can now roll back node pools to a previous working version if you detect an issue in the new version after a cluster upgrade. For more information, see Rolling back a node pool after an upgrade .
Preview : The following private registry updates are now available:
Support for private registry credentials using prepared Secrets is now available as a preview feature. A new privateRegistry field has been added in the Secrets configuration file .
Added a new privateRegistry section in the user cluster configuration file. You can use different private registry credentials for the user cluster and admin cluster. You can also use a different private registry address for user clusters with Controlplane V2 enabled.
You can also update private registry credentials for an admin cluster or user cluster with the gkectl update credentials command. For more information, see Update private registry credentials .
Cluster names are now included in kubeconfig files when creating a new admin cluster or user cluster. If you are upgrading your existing cluster to 1.14.0 or higher, the existing kubeconfig file is updated with the cluster name.
cluster-health-controller is now integrated with health-check-exporter to emit metrics based on the periodic health check results, making it easy to monitor and detect cluster health problems.
GA : The node pool update policy is generally available. With this feature, you can configure the value of maximumConcurrentNodePoolUpdate in the user cluster configuration file to 1 . This will configure the maximum number of additional nodes spawned during cluster upgrade or update, which can potentially avoid two issues — resource quota limit issue and PDB deadlock issue. For more information, see Configure node pool update policy .
Support for vSphere cluster/host/network/datastore folders is generally available. You can use folders to group objects of the same type for easier management. For more information, see Specify vSphere folders in cluster configuration and the relevant sections in the admin cluster and user cluster configuration files.
Added a feature enabling cluster administrators to configure RBAC policies based on Azure Active Directory (AD) groups . Group information for users belonging to more than 200 groups can now be retrieved.
Feature
Anthos clusters on VMware 1.14.0-gke.430 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading Anthos clusters on VMware . Anthos clusters on VMware 1.14.0-gke.430 runs on Kubernetes 1.25.5-gke.100.

Fixed an issue where anet-operator could be scheduled to a Windows node with enableControlplaneV2: true .
Buggy IPs are excluded in node IPAM when a CIDR range is specified in the IP block file.
Increased memory limit of monitoring-operator- Pods 1 GB to avoid potential OOM events under certain configurations.
Fixed the issue of missing control plane metrics for user clusters that have Controlplane V2 enabled.
Switched the scraping port of metrics-agent from 10255 to 10250 (secure port) to collect kubelet summary API metrics.
Fixed the issue where nodes fail to register if the configured hostname in the IP block file contains one or more periods.
Fixed the issue where deleting a user cluster also deleted cluster-health-controller and vsphere-metrics-exporter ClusterRole objects.
Fixed the unspecified Internal Server error in ClientConfig when using the AIS hub feature to manage the OpenID Connect (OIDC) configuration.
Fixed a bug where running gkectl diagnose snapshot using system scenario did not capture Cluster API resources in the default namespace.
Fixed an issue where cluster deletion may be stuck at node draining when the user cluster control plane and node pools are on different datastores.
Fixed the issue of /var/log/audit/ filling up disk space on the admin workstation.
Fixed the issue where the Connect Agent in the admin cluster does not upgrade after failures to upgrade nodes in the user cluster control plane.
Improved the preflight check error message by including the project ID that requires the permission.
Fixed the issue during admin cluster creation where gkectl check-config fails due to missing OS images, if gkectl prepare is not run first.
Fixed the issue where updating a cluster to enable or disable anti-affinity does not work when Controlplane V2 is enabled.
Replaced text/template library with safetext/yamltemplate library to fix YAML injection vulnerabilities.
Converted the resource type of certain stackdriver-operator metrics from k8s_pod to k8s_container . If you keep the default setting of scalablemonitoring to true , the old resource type k8s_pod will remain.

October 12, 2022
Issue
The Connect Agent version used in Anthos clusters on VMware versions 1.8 and earlier is no longer supported. If you upgrade your user cluster to these versions, the gkectl updgrade cluster command may fail. If you encounter this issue and need further assistance, you should contact Google Support.
October 11, 2022
Issue
If you use gcloud anthos version 1.4.2, and authenticate an Anthos cluster on VMware with gcloud anthos auth , the command fails with the following error:
Decryption failed, no keys in the current key set could decrypt the payload.
To resolve this, you must upgrade gcloud anthos to 1.4.3 or above ( gcloud SDK 397.0.0 or above) to authenticate clusters with gcloud anthos auth .
September 29, 2022
Change
Upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04 and containerd 1.6.
connectgateway.googleapis.com API is now required to create new clusters in 1.13.0.
Updated the gcloud version in the admin workstation to 401.0.0.
Increased the default boot disk size for the admin workstation to 100GB.
SImplified the gkectl diagnose snapshot scenario usage. The --scenario flag is no longer needed for the admin cluster snapshot. Use system (default) or all values to specify scenarios for the user cluster snapshot. For more details, see Diagnosing cluster issues .
Improved gkectl diagnose cluster to detect and diagnose two general issues:
Node draining issues can block cluster upgrade
Kubernetes Cluster API resource managed by an Anthos clusters on VMware bundle might be accidentally modified which can cause failure of system components, or cluster upgrade or update failure.
Enforced admin cluster registration with preflight checks.
This also applies to admin clusters to be upgraded to 1.13. You can run gkectl update admin to register existing 1.12 admin clusters.
You can skip this check with the --skip-validation-config flag if you cannot register admin clusters for certain reasons.
Configuration for Logging and Monitoring is now enforced in admin and user cluster configuration files during creation preflight checking. You can run gkectl update cluster and gkectl update admin to enable Logging and Monitoring in existing 1.12 user or admin clusters before upgrading to 1.13. Otherwise, upgrade preflight checks will emit a warning. You can skip these checks with the --skip-validation-stackdriver flag if you cannot enable Logging and Monitoring for certain reasons. However, enabling Logging and Monitoring is strongly recommended to get better Google support, and there is no charge for this service on Anthos.
When Logging and Monitoring is enabled, the values of the gkeConnect.projectID field, stackdriver.projectID field, and cloudAuditLogging.projectID field must all be the same in the cluster configuration files. Otherwise, cluster creation preflight checks would fail with an error, and upgrade preflight checks would emit a warning. You can also skip these checks with the --skip-validation-stackdriver flag, but this is not recommended as using different project IDs for stackdriver and gkeconnect may cause friction during support and fleet management. Note you can still send logs and metrics to a different project through Cloud Logging sinks and metric viewer scoping .
Migrated metrics-server and addon-resizer to a new namespace: gke-managed-metrics-server .
Refined kube-state-metrics so that only core metrics are collected by default. Fewer resources are needed to collect this optimized set of metrics, which improves overall performance and scalability.
Issue
In the configuration file template generated by gkectl create-config cluster , the pre-populated value for the commented field kubeception is shown as false , while the default value is true .
In the configuration file template generated by gkectl create-config admin , gkeConnect is shown as an optional section, however it is actually a required section.
Fixed
Fixed the issue of cloud-init log not showing in the serial console for Ubuntu.
Fixed the issue where user cluster check-config fails when the admin cluster uses cos as the osImageType .
Updated virtual hardware version to version 15 for creating VMs in Anthos cluster on VMware 1.13.0.
Fixed the issue of two missing metrics, scheduler and controller-manager, in the admin and user cluster.
Fixed the issue of an empty CPU readiness chart in OOTB dashboards that was caused by deprecated metrics.
Fixed the issue where you may not be able to add a new user cluster if a user cluster is stuck in the deletion process, and your admin cluster is set up with a MetalLB load balancer configuration.
Fixed the following vulnerabilities:
Critical container vulnerabilities:
CVE-2022-2068

CVE-2022-0778
CVE-2022-1292
Feature
Cluster life-cycle Improvements:
GA : A new asynchronous variation of the user cluster upgrade is now supported. With this variation, the gkectl upgrade cluster command starts the upgrade and completes. You don't need to watch the output of the command for the entire duration of the upgrade. For more details, see Upgrade a user cluster .
Preview : You can now update node pools either sequentially or maintain the default parallel behavior by specifying the value of maximumConcurrentNodePoolUpdate in your user cluster configuration file. Setting the value to 1 will configure the node pool update to be sequential, which can potentially avoid two issues — resource quota limit issue and PDB deadlock issue.
Introduced an admin cluster controller for managing the admin cluster lifecycle.
Added new preflight checks:
Check that node IPs are in the subnet for IPAM.
A new preflight check was added to validate the clusterLocation field under stackdriver and cloudAuditLogging . This preflight check requires the component access service account to have the compute.viewer role, and the compute.googleapis.com to be allowlisted in the HTTP proxy and firewall settings. If you use an invalid value in the clusterLocation , the preflight check will fail. You can correct the invalid clusterLocation by removing the stackdriver and/or cloudAuditLogging configurations from the admin or user cluster configuration files, applying the changes with gkectl update , and then add the corrected configurations back. Or, you can use --skip-validation-gcp to skip the check. Note that having an invalid clusterLocation will cause a failure to export logs and metrics.
For a cluster in static IP mode, you need to have one IP address for each node and an additional IP address. This additional IP address will be used for a temporary node during cluster update, upgrade and auto-repair.
Validate that IP addresses are not in docker IP range in IPAM mode.
Check to make sure there is no node port collision among different user clusters in manual load balancing mode.
Check datastore size to ensure it has enough capacity for surge machine.
Check for an available IP address for creating Windows VM template in IPAM mode.
PDB preflight check to prevent multiple PDBs from matching with the same pod.
Platform enhancements:
GA : Support for cos OS image type in admin cluster nodes is now generally available. You can update the admin node image type with the gkectl update admin command.
Preview : A new user cluster deployment model with support for multi-vCenter deployments is available as a preview feature. For more details on how to create a user cluster with this new model, see Create a user cluster with a new installation model .
Preview : vSphere CSI volume snapshot is now available as a preview feature. This feature provides the ability to create volume snapshots and restore volumes from snapshots using VMware Cloud Native Storage. To use this feature, you must update both vCenter Server and ESXi to version 7.0 Update 3 or later.
Security enhancements:
GA : Support for storing credentials for user clusters as Kubernetes Secrets is generally available.
With this feature, users can prepare credentials for the user cluster, and store them as Kubernetes Secrets in the admin cluster before a user cluster is created. After credential preparation, users can delete the Secrets configuration file which contains the user cluster credentials from the admin workstation. When creating a user cluster, the prepared credentials will be used. For more details, see Configure prepared credentials for user clusters .
Kubernetes service account (KSA) Signing Key rotation is supported on user clusters. For more details, see Rotate KSA signing keys .
GA : Component access SA key rotation for both admin and user clusters is generally available.
GA : You can set up Connect gateway to use Google Group membership for authorization. For more information, see Set up the Connect gateway with Google Groups .
Changed kube-scheduler , kube-etcd , kube-apiserver and Key Management Service (KMS) components to run in rootless mode in the user cluster.
Simplify day-2 operations:
Preview : Added support of multi-line parsing for Go and Java logs.
GA : Launched the enablement of Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus to track metrics in Anthos on vSphere clusters, and introduced two separate flags to enable logging and monitoring for user applications separately: EnableCloudLoggingForApplications and EnableGMPForApplications . You can monitor and alert on the applications using Prometheus with Google-managed Prometheus without managing and operating Prometheus. You can set enableGMPForApplications in the Stackdriver spec to enable Google Managed Prometheus for application metrics without any other manual steps, and the Google Managed Prometheus components are then set up automatically. See Enable Managed Service for Prometheus for user applications for details.
Added a new Anthos Utilization Metering dashboard in Cloud Monitoring to monitor cluster health. The dashboard shows CPU and memory utilization in the clusters by namespace and Pod labels.
Breaking
vSphere versions below 7.0 Update 1 are no longer supported in Anthos clusters on VMware. You must upgrade vSphere (both ESXi and vCenter) to version 7.0 Update 1 or above before you can upgrade to Anthos clusters on VMware 1.13.0. If you want to use the vSphere Container Storage Interface driver or NFSv3 , then you must upgrade to vSphere 7.0 Update 2 or a later update of version 7.0.

Feature
Anthos clusters on VMware v1.12.0-gke.446 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading Anthos clusters on VMware . Anthos clusters on VMware v1.12.0-gke.446 runs on Kubernetes v1.23.5-gke.1504.
The supported versions offering the latest patches and updates for security vulnerabilities, exposures, and issues impacting Anthos clusters on VMware are 1.12, 1.11, and 1.10.
Feature
Platform enhancements:
General Availability (GA) : Separate vSphere data centers for the admin cluster and the user clusters are supported.
GA: Anthos Identity service LDAP authentication is supported.
GA: User cluster control-plane node and admin cluster add-on node auto sizing is supported.
Security enhancements:
Preview: Preparing credentials for user clusters as Kubernetes secrets before cluster creation.
The credential preparation feature prepares the credentials before a user cluster is created. After credential preparation, user cluster credentials are saved as versioned Kubernetes secrets in the admin cluster, and the template which is used for credential preparation can be deleted from the admin workstation. When creating a user cluster, it only needs to configure the namespace and the versions of the prepared secrets in the user cluster config file. Using this feature can help protect user cluster credentials.
Preview: The gkectl update credentials command supports rotating the component access SA key for both the admin and the user clusters.
The COS node image shipped in version 1.12.0 is qualified with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) L1 Server Benchmark .
The gkectl update credentials command supports register service account key rotation.
Cluster lifecycle Improvements:
Preview: You can configure the time duration of Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) violation timeout during a node drain. The default behavior is to always block on a PDB violation and to not force-delete pods during node drain, to avoid unexpected data corruption, and this default is unchanged. In certain cases, when users want to unblock the PDB violation deadlock with the bound timeout during cluster upgrade, they can apply the special annotation onprem.cluster.gke.io/pdb-violation-timeout: TIMEOUT on the machine objects.
Simplify day-2 operations
Preview: Launched the enablement of Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus to track metrics in Anthos on vSphere clusters, and introduced two separate flags to enable logging and monitoring for user applications separately: EnableCloudLoggingForApplications and EnableGMPForApplications . The legacy flag EnableStackdriverForApplications is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. Customers can monitor and alert on the applications using Prometheus with Google-managed Prometheus without managing and operating Prometheus. Customers can set enableGMPForApplications in the Stackdriver spec to enable Google Managed Prometheus for application metrics without any other manual steps, and the Google Managed Prometheus components are then set up automatically. See Enable Managed Service for Prometheus for user applications for details.
All sample dashboards to monitor cluster health are available in Cloud Monitoring sample dashboards. Customers can install the dashboards with one click. See Install sample dashboards .
Improvements to cluster diagnosis: The gkectl diagnose cluster command automatically runs when gkectl diagnose snapshot is run, and the output is saved in a new folder in the snapshot called /diagnose-report .
The gkectl diagnose cluster command surfaces more detailed information for issues arising from virtual machine creation.
A validation check for the existence of an OS image has been added to the gkectl update admin and gkectl diagnose cluster commands.
A blocking preflight check has been added. This check validates that the vCenter.datastore specified in the cluster configuration file doesn't belong to a DRS-enabled datastore cluster.
Announcement
Announcements
vSphere releases for versions lower than version 7.0 Update 2 are deprecated in Kubernetes 1.24. VMware's General Support for vSphere 6.7 will end on October 15, 2022. Customers are recommended to upgrade vSphere (both ESXi and vCenter) to version 7.0 Update 2 or above. vSphere versions less than version 7.0 Update 2 will no longer be supported in Anthos clusters on VMware in an upcoming version. You must upgrade vSphere to 7.0 Update 2 or above before you can upgrade to Anthos clusters on VMware 1.13.0.
Beta versions of VolumeSnapshot CRDs are deprecated in Kubernetes v1.20 and are unsupported in the Kubernetes v1.24 release.
The upcoming Anthos clusters on VMware version 1.13 release will no longer serve v1beta1 VolumeSnapshot CRDs. Make sure that you migrate manifests and API clients to use snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1 API version, available since Kubernetes v1.20.
All existing persisted objects remain accessible via the new snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1 APIs.
The dockershim component in Kubernetes enables cluster nodes to use the Docker Engine container runtime. However, Kubernetes 1.24 removed the dockershim component. Starting from Anthos clusters on VMware version 1.12.0, you cannot create new clusters that use the Docker Engine container runtime. All new clusters must use the default container runtime Containerd. A cluster update will also be blocked if you want to switch from containerd node pool to docker node pool, or if you add new docker node pools. For existing version 1.11.x clusters with docker node pools, you can continue upgrading it to version 1.12.0, but you must update the node pools to use containerd before you can upgrade to version 1.13.0 in the future.
Breaking
Breaking changes:
In Kubernetes 1.23, the rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API version is removed. Instead, use the rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 API. See the Kubernetes 1.23.5 release notes .
Change
Functionality changes:
Upgraded COS from m93 to m97 , and containerd to 1.6 on COS.
Metrics agent: Upgraded gke-metrics-agent from 1.1.0 to 1.8.3, which fixes some application metrics issues. The offline buffer in the metrics agent can now discard old data based on the age of metrics data, in addition to the total size of buffer. Metrics data is stored in an offline buffer for at most 22 hours in case of a network outage.
New metrics: Added 7 resource utilization metrics.

Announcement
The structure of the Anthos clusters on VMware documentation is substantially different from previous versions. For details, see New documentation structure .
Dockershim, the Docker Engine integration code in Kubernetes, was deprecated in Kubernetes 1.20 , and will be removed in Kubernetes 1.24. Thus, the ubuntu OS node image type will not be supported at that time. You should plan to convert your node pools to use either the ubuntu_containerd or the cos OS image type as soon as possible. For more details, see Using containerd for the container runtime .
The connect project is now called fleet host project . For more information, see Fleet host project .
Breaking
Kubernetes 1.22 has deprecated certain APIs, a list of which can be found in Kubernetes 1.22 deprecated APIs . In your manifests and API clients, you need to replace references to the deprecated APIs with references to the newer API calls. For more information, see the What to do section in the Deprecated API Migration Guide.
Several Anthos metrics have been deprecated for which data is no longer collected. For a list of deprecated metrics, including instructions to migrate to replacement metrics, see Replace deprecated metrics in dashboard .

Platform enhancements :
Windows Node Pool:
GA : Support for Windows Dataplane V2 is generally available. Windows Dataplane V2 is now enabled by default for Windows node pools. This means that containerd is also enabled by default for Windows node pools.
Added deprecation notice for Windows nodes that Docker and Flannel will be removed in a subsequent version. If you are using Docker container runtime, you should update your user cluster configuration with gkectl update cluster to use containerd and Windows Dataplane V2 instead.
Added support for idempotent Windows startup script execution after node reboot.
New Windows Server 2019 OS build version 10.0.17763.2565 has been qualified for Anthos 1.11.0.
Egress NAT Gateway:
GA: Egress NAT Gateway is now generally available. With this feature, you can configure source network address translation (SNAT) so that certain egress traffic from user clusters is given a predictable source IP address. This enables return traffic from workloads outside the originating cluster to reach the cluster. For more information, see Configuring an egress NAT gateway .
MetalLB:
GA: The new load balancer option, MetalLB , is now generally available as another bundled software load balancer in addition to Seesaw.
Multinic logs:
The Fluent Bit Logging agent can now collect logs for Pods with multiple network interfaces, and send them to Cloud Logging . Logs will be collected as system logs and no extra charges will apply.
Security enhancements :
- Admin cluster CA Certificate Rotation:
GA : You can now use gkectl to rotate system root CA certificates for admin clusters.
Simplify day-2 operations:
GA: gkectl update admin supports registering an existing admin cluster.
Cluster diagnosis improvements:
gkectl diagnose cluster automatically runs during admin or user cluster upgrade failure.
gkectl diagnose cluster searches and surfaces related events for any validation failure.
GA: gkectl update supports enabling and disabling of Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring in an existing cluster. You can also enable or disable logging to Cloud Audit Logs with gkectl update on both admin and user clusters.
Changes made to the metrics-server-config ConfigMap are now preserved across cluster upgrades.

RBAC policies applied to service account on the admin cluster
When you register a 1.11.0+ admin cluster to a fleet, a service account is created with the needed role-based access control (RBAC) policies that lets the Connect agent send requests to the admin cluster's Kubernetes API server on behalf of the service account. The service account and RBAC policies are needed so that you can manage the lifecycle of your user clusters in the Google Cloud console. For more information, see Admin cluster RBAC policies .

December 23, 2021
Issue
When deploying Anthos clusters on VMware releases with a version number of 1.9.0 or higher, that have the Seesaw bundled load balancer in an environment that uses NSX-T stateful distributed firewall rules, stackdriver-operator might fail to create gke-metrics-agent-conf ConfigMap and cause gke-connect-agent Pods to be in a crash loop. The underlying issue is that stateful NSX-T distributed firewall rules terminate the connection from a client to the user cluster API server through the Seesaw load balancer because Seesaw uses asymmetric connection flows. The integration issue with NSX-T distributed firewall rules affect all Anthos clusters on VMWare releases that use Seesaw. You might see similar connection problems on your own applications when they create large Kubernetes objects whose sizes are bigger than 32K. Follow these instructions to disable NSX-T distributed firewall rules, or to use stateless distributed firewall rules for Seesaw VMs.
If your clusters use a manual load balancer, follow these instructions to configure your load balancer to reset client connections when it detects a backend node failure. Without this configuration, clients of the Kubernetes API server might stop responding for several minutes when a server instance goes down.

Feature
Cluster lifecycle Improvements:
An admin cluster upgrade is resumable after a previous failed admin cluster upgrade attempt.
GA: Admin cluster registration during new cluster creation is generally available.
Preview: Admin cluster registration when updating existing clusters is available as a preview feature.
Platform enhancements:
Preview: A new load balancer option, MetalLB, is available as another bundled software load balancer in addition to Seesaw.This will be the default load balancer choice instead of Seesaw when GA.
GA: Support for user cluster node pool autoscaling is generally available.
Preview: You can create admin cluster nodes and user cluster control-plane nodes with Container-Optimized OS by specifying the osImageType as cos in the admin cluster configuration file.
Windows Node Pool:
Preview: The containerd runtime is now available for Windows node pools when Dataplane V2 for Windows is enabled.
Node Problem Detector checks containerd service health on the nodes and surfaces problems to the API Server. For version 1.10.0, NPD does not attempt to repair the containerd service.
Containerd logs are exported to the Cloud Console.
CSI proxy is deployed automatically onto Windows nodes. You can install and use a Windows CSI driver of your choice, such as the SMB CSI driver .
GA: The multi-NIC capability to provide additional network interfaces to your Pods is generally available.
GA: You can upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 and containerd 1.5.
Security enhancements:
User cluster control plane certificates are automatically rotated at each cluster upgrade.
Simplify day-2 operations:
Preview: gkectl update admin supports the enabling and disabling of Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging in the admin cluster.
Changed the collection of application metrics to use a more scalable monitoring pipeline based on OpenTelemetry. This change significantly reduces the amount of resources required to collect metrics.
Updated the parser of containerd and kubelet node logs to extract severity level.
Introduced the --share-with optional flag in the gkectl diagnose snapshot command to share the read permission after uploading the snapshot to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
Breaking
vCenter/ESXi host 6.7u2 and below is no longer supported. Upgrade your vCenter environment to a supported version (6.7U3 and above) before upgrading your clusters.
The diskformat parameter is removed from the standard vSphere driver StorageClass as the parameter has been deprecated in Kubernetes 1.21.
Preview: Egress NAT gateway:
To enable an egress NAT gateway, the advancedNetworking section in the user cluster configuration file replaces the now-deprecated enableAnthosNetworkGateway section.
You must create a NetworkGatewayGroup object (previously AnthosNetworkGateway) to configure the egress NAT gateway.
Any admin or user clusters that are version 1.9 or earlier, and that are enabled with Anthos Network Gateway, cannot be upgraded. You must delete and recreate those clusters following these instructions .
Change
Functionality changes:
Replaced the SSH tunnel with Konnectivity service for communication between the user cluster control plane and the user cluster nodes. The Kubernetes SSH tunnel has been deprecated.
You must create two additional firewall rules so that user worker nodes can access ports 8132 on the user control-plane VIP address and get return packets. This is required for the Konnectivity service.
Introduced a new konnectivityServerNodePort field in the user cluster manual load balancer configuration. This field is required when creating or upgrading a user cluster, with manual load balancer mode, to version 1.10.
The Ubuntu OS image is upgraded from 18.04 to 20.04 LTS.
The python command is no longer available. Any python command should be updated to python3 instead, and the syntax should be updated to Python 3.
/etc/resolv.conf now points to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf , instead of /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf .
The Ubuntu CIS benchmark version changed from v2.0.1 for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to v1.0.0 for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Upgraded COS from m89 to m93 .
Upgraded containerd from 1.4 to 1.5 on Ubuntu and COS.
Changed gkectl diagnose snapshot to use the --all-with-logs scenario by default.
The gkeadm command copies the admin workstation configuration file to the admin workstation during creation so it can be used as a backup to re-create the admin workstation later.
Increased the Pod priority of kube-state-metrics to improve its reliability when the cluster is under resource contention.
Fixed
Fixed an issue that the Windows nodes were assigned with duplicated IP addresses.
Fixed CVE-2021-32760 . Because of Ubuntu PPA version pinning , this vulnerability might still be reported by certain vulnerability scanning tools, and thus appear as a false positive even though the underlying vulnerability has been patched.
Issue
Because of the change to use an OpenTelemetry-based scalable monitoring pipeline for application metrics, Horizontal Pod Autoscaling with user-defined metrics does not work in 1.10.0 unless you explicitly set scalableMonitoring to false , while also ensuring that both enableStackdriverForApplications and enableCustomMetricsAdapter are set to true , in the Stackdriver object.
As a workaround, you can install a custom Prometheus adapter if you want to use Horizontal Pod Autoscaling with user-defined metrics while still keeping the scalable monitoring default setting for application metrics.
Because of a COS 93 configuration issue, IPv6 dualstack does not work correctly for COS node pool nodes in version 1.10.0. If you are using IPv6 dualstack with a COS node pool, wait for an upcoming patch release that addresses this issue.
If an admin cluster is created with osImagetype of cos , and you have rotated the audit logging service account key with gkectl update admin , the changes are overridden after the admin cluster control-plane node reboot. In that case, re-run the update command after the admin cluster control-plane node reboot to apply those changes.
On COS nodes, the NTP server is configured to time.google.com by default. In DHCP mode, this setting cannot be overridden to use the NTP server provided by your DHCP server. The issue will be fixed in an upcoming patch release. Before then, you can deploy a DaemonSet to override the NTP setting if you want to use a different NTP server in your COS node pool.

Anthos clusters on VMware 1.9.0-gke.8 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading Anthos clusters on VMware . Anthos clusters on VMware 1.9.0-gke.8 runs on Kubernetes v1.21.4-gke.200.
The supported versions offering the latest patches and updates for security vulnerabilities, exposures, and issues impacting Anthos clusters on VMware are 1.9, 1.8, and 1.7.
Feature
Features:
Cluster lifecycle Improvements:
GA: You can register an admin cluster during its creation by filling in the gkeConnect section in the admin cluster configuration file, similar to user cluster registration .
Platform enhancements:
Preview: User clusters can now be in a different vSphere datacenter from the admin cluster, resulting in datacenter isolation between the admin cluster and user clusters. This provides greater resiliency in the case of vSphere environment failures.
GA: Support for Windows node pools is generally available.This release adds:
Preview: Windows DataplaneV2 support, which allows for using Windows Network Policy
Node Problem Detector (NPD) support on Windows
Streamlined process for preparing Windows images in a private registry
Enhanced Flannel CNI support on Windows
The upstream fixes for the "Windows Pod stuck at terminating status" error are also applied to this release, which improves the stability of running Windows workloads.
GA: Support for Container-Optimized OS (COS) node pools is generally available.
GA: CoreDNS is now the cluster DNS provider.
Clusters that are upgraded to 1.9 will have their KubeDNS provider replaced with CoreDNS. During the upgrade, CoreDNS is first deployed and then KubeDNS is removed, so applications should not observe DNS unavailability. However before upgrading, ensure that your cluster has enough additional resources to deploy CoreDNS. CoreDNS requires 100 millicpu and 170 MiB of memory per instance, all clusters require a minimum of 2 instances, and there is an additional instance deployed for every 16 nodes in the cluster.
You can configure cluster DNS options such as upstream name servers by using the new ClusterDNS custom resource .
Security enhancements:
GA: Always-on secrets encryption: You can enable secrets encryption with internally generated keys instead of a hardware security module (HSM). Use the gkectl update command to rotate these keys or to enable or disable secrets encryption after cluster creation.
Preview: Windows network policy support. This release introduces a new network plugin, Antrea, for Windows nodes. In addition to network connectivity and services support, it provides network policy support. When creating a user cluster, you can set enableWindowsDataplaneV2 to true to enable this feature. Enabling this feature replaces Flannel with Antrea on Windows nodes.
Preview: Azure AD group support for Authentication: This feature allows cluster admins to configure RBAC policies based on Azure AD groups for authorization in clusters. This supports retrieval of groups information for users belonging to more than 200 groups, thus overcoming a limitation of regular OIDC configured with Azure AD as the identity provider.
Simplify day-2 operations:
Preview: When creating a user cluster, you can set enableVMTracking in the configuration file to true to enable vSphere tag creation and attachment to the VMs in the user cluster. This allows easy mapping of VMs to clusters and node pools. See Enable VM tracking .
GA: New metrics agents based on open telemetry are introduced to improve reliability, scalability and resource usage.
Preview: You can enable or disable Stackdriver with gkectl update on existing user clusters. You can enable or disable cloud audit logging and monitoring with gkectl update on both admin and user clusters.
Breaking
Breaking changes:
User cluster registration is now required and enforced. You must fill in the gkeConnect section of the user cluster configuration file before creating a new user cluster. You cannot upgrade a user cluster unless that cluster is registered. To unblock the cluster upgrade, add the gkeConnect section to the configuration file and run gkectl update cluster to register an existing 1.8 user cluster.
User clusters must be upgraded before the admin cluster. The flag --force-upgrade-admin to allow the old upgrade flow (admin cluster upgrade first) is no longer supported.
The following requirements are now enforced when you create a cluster that has logging and monitoring enabled.
The Config Monitoring for Ops API is enabled in your logging-monitoring project.
The Ops Config Monitoring Resource Metadata Writer role is granted to your logging-monitoring service account.
The URL opsconfigmonitoring.googleapis.com is added to your proxy allowlist (if applicable).
Note: Although the preceding requirements are not enforced for upgrading clusters to 1.9, we strongly recommended that you fulfill the requirements.
Change
Changes:
There is now a checkpoint file for the admin cluster, located in the same datastore folder as the admin cluster data disk, with the name DATA_DISK_NAME-checkpoint.yaml , or DATA_DISK_NAME.yaml if the length of DATA_DISK_NAME is greater than the filename length limit. This file is required for future upgrades and should be considered as important as the admin cluster data disk.
Note: If you have enabled VM encryption in vCenter, you must grant Cryptographer.Access permission to the vCenter credentials specified in your admin cluster configuration file, before trying to create or upgrade your admin cluster.
The admin cluster backup with gkectl preview feature introduced in 1.8 now allows updates to clusterBackup.datastore . This datastore may be different from vCenter.datastore so long as it is in the same datacenter as the cluster.
The k8s 1.21 release includes the following metrics changes:
Add new field status for storage_operation_duration_seconds , so that you can know about all status storage operation latency.
The storage metrics storage_operation_errors_total and storage_operation_status_count are marked deprecated. In both cases, the storage_operation_duration_seconds metric can be used to recover equivalent counts (using status=fail-unknown in the case of storage_operations_errors_total ).
Rename the metric etcd_object_counts to apiserver_storage_object_counts and mark it as stable. The original etcd_object_counts metrics name is marked as "Deprecated" and will be removed in the future.
A new GKE on-prem control plane uptime dashboard is introduced with a new metric, kubernetes.io/anthos/container/uptime , for component availability. The old GKE on-prem control plane status dashboard and old kubernetes.io/anthos/up metric are deprecated. New alerts for admin cluster control plane components availability and user cluster control plane components availability are introduced with a new kubernetes.io/anthos/container/uptime metric to replace deprecated alerts and the old kubernetes.io/anthos/up metric.
You can now skip certain health checks performed by gkectl diagnose cluster with the –skip-validation-xxx flag.
Issue
Restoring an admin cluster from a backup using gkectl repair admin-master –restore-from-backup fails when using a private registry. The issue will be resolved in a future release.
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed the issue of gkeadm trying to set permissions for the component access service account when --auto-create-service-accounts=false .
Fixed the timeout issue for admin cluster creation or upgrade that was caused by high network latency to reach the container registry.
Fixed the gkectl create-config admin and gkectl create-config cluster
panic issue in the 1.8.0-1.8.3 releases.
Fixed the /run/aide disk usage issue that was caused by the accumulated cron log for aide.

The supported versions offering the latest patches and updates for security vulnerabilities, exposures, and issues impacting Anthos clusters on VMware are 1.8, 1.7, and 1.6.
Change
Cluster lifecycle improvements:
You should no longer use gcloud to unregister a user cluster, because clusters are registered automatically. Instead, register existing user clusters by using gkectl update cluster . You can also use gkectl update cluster to consolidate out-of-band registration that was done using gcloud . For more information, see Cluster registration .
Feature
Platform enhancements:
Preview: Cluster autoscaling is now available in preview. With cluster autoscaling, you can horizontally scale node pools in proportion to workload demand. When demand is high, the cluster autoscaler adds nodes to the node pool. When demand is low, the cluster autoscaler removes nodes from the node pool, scaling back down to a minimum size that you designate. Cluster autoscaling can increase the availability of your workloads while controlling costs.
Preview: User cluster control-plane node and admin cluster add-on node auto sizing are now available in preview. The features can be enabled separately in user cluster or admin cluster configurations. When you enable user cluster control-plane node auto sizing, user cluster control-plane nodes are automatically resized in proportion to the number of node pool nodes in the given user cluster. When you enable admin cluster add-on node auto sizing, admin cluster add-on nodes are automatically resized in proportion to the number nodes in the admin cluster.
Preview: Windows Server container support for Anthos clusters on VMware is now available in preview. This allows you to modernize and run your Windows-based apps more efficiently in your data centers without having to go through risky application rewrites. You can use Windows containers alongside Linux containers for your container workloads. The same experience and benefits that you have come to enjoy with Anthos clusters on VMware using Linux--application portability, consolidation, cost savings, and agility--can now be applied to Windows Server applications also.
Preview: Admin cluster backup is now available in preview. With this feature enabled, admin cluster backups are automatically performed before and after user and admin cluster creation, update, and upgrade. A new gkectl backup admin command performs manual backup. Upon admin cluster storage failure, you can restore the admin cluster from a backup with the gkectl repair admin-cluster --restore-from-backup command.
Change
Functionality changes:
The admin cluster now uses containerd on all nodes, including the admin cluster control-plane node, admin cluster add-on nodes, and user cluster control-plane nodes. This applies to both new admin clusters and existing admin clusters upgraded from 1.7.x. On user cluster node pools, containerd is the default container runtime for new node pools, but existing node pools that are upgraded from 1.7.x will continue using Docker Engine. You can continue to use Docker Engine for a new node pool by setting its osImageType to ubuntu .
A new ubuntu_containerd OS image type is introduced. ubuntu_containerd uses an identical OS image as ubuntu , but the node is configured to use containerd as the container runtime instead. The ubuntu_containerd OS is used for new node pools by default, but existing node pools upgraded from 1.7.x continue using Docker Engine.
Docker Engine support will be removed in Kubernetes 1.24, and you should start converting your node pools to ubuntu_containerd as soon as possible.
When installing or upgrading to 1.8.0-gke.21 on a vCenter with a vSphere version older than 6.7 Update 3, you may receive a notification. Note that vSphere versions older than 6.7 Update 3 will no longer be supported in Anthos clusters on VMware in an upcoming version.
The create-config Secret is removed in both the admin and the user clusters. If you previously relied on workarounds that modify the secret(s), contact Cloud Support for updates.
You can update the CPU and memory configuration for the user cluster control-plane node with gkectl update cluster .
You can configure the CPU and memory configurations for the admin control-plane node to non-default settings during admin cluster creation through the newly introduced admin cluster configuration fields.
Node auto repairs are throttled at the node pool level. The number of repairs per hour for a node pool is limited to the either 3, or 10% of the number of nodes in the node pool, whichever is greater.
Starting from Kubernetes 1.20, timeouts on exec probes are honored, and default to one second if unspecified. If you have Pods using exec probes, ensure they can easily complete in one second or explicitly set an appropriate timeout. See Configure Probes for more details.
Starting from Kubernetes 1.20, Kubelet no longer creates the target_path for NodePublishVolume in accordance with the CSI spec. If you have self-managed CSI drivers deployed in your cluster, ensure they are idempotent and do any necessary mount creation/verification. See Kubernetes issue #88759 for details.
Non-deterministic treatment of objects with invalid ownerReferences was fixed in Kubernetes 1.20. You can run the kubectl-check-ownerreferences tool prior to upgrade to locate existing objects with invalid ownerReferences.
The metadata.selfLink field, deprecated since Kubernetes 1.16, is no longer populated in Kubernetes 1.20. See Kubernetes issue #1164 for details.
Feature
Simplify day-2 operations:
You can now use Anthos Identity Service (AIS) and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication to admin clusters in addition to user clusters.
Preview: Anthos Identity Service can now resolve groups with Okta as identity provider. This allows administrators to write RBAC policy with Okta groups.
Preview: Anthos Identity service now supports LDAP authentication methods in addition to OIDC. You can use AIS with Microsoft Active Directory without the need for provisioning Active Directory Federation Services.
The Anthos metadata agent replaces the original metadata agent to collect and send Anthos metadata to Google Cloud Platform, so that Google Cloud Platform can use this metadata to build a better user interface for Anthos clusters. You must 1) enable the Config Monitoring for Ops API in your logging-monitoring project , 2) grant the Ops Config Monitoring Resource Metadata Writer role to your logging-monitoring service account , and 3) add opsconfigmonitoring.googleapis.com to your proxy allowlist (if applicable).
You can use gkectl diagnose snapshot --upload-to [GCS_BUCKET] --service-account-key-file [SA_KEY_FILE] to automatically upload snapshots to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. The provided service account must have the roles/storage.admin IAM role enabled.
Feature
Network feature enhancements:
Preview: Egress NAT gateway is now available in preview. To be able to access off-cluster workloads, traffic originating within the cluster that is related to specific flows must have deterministic source IP addresses. Egress NAT gateway gives you fine-grained control over which traffic gets a deterministic source IP address, and then provides that address. The Egress NAT Gateway functionality is built on top of Dataplane V2.
Feature
Storage enhancements:
The Anthos vSphere CSI driver now supports both offline and online volume expansion for dynamically and statically created block volumes only.
Offline volume expansion is available in vSphere 7.0 and later. Online expansion is available in vSphere 7.0u2 and later.
The vSphere CSI driver StorageClass standard-rwo , which is installed in user clusters automatically, sets allowVolumeExpansion to true by default for newly created clusters running on vSphere 7.0 or later. You can use both online and offline expansion for volumes using this StorageClass.
The volume snapshot feature now supports v1 versions of VolumeSnapshot, VolumeSnapshotContent, and VolumeSnapshotClass objects. The v1beta1 versions are deprecated and will soon stop being served.
Feature
Security enhancements:
The Ubuntu node image is qualified with the CIS (Center for Internet Security) L1/L2 Server Benchmark.
Generally available: Workload identity support is now generally available. For more information, see Fleet workload identity . The connect-agent service account key is no longer required during installation. The connect agent uses workload identity to authenticate to Google Cloud instead of an exported Google Cloud service account key.
You can now use gkectl to rotate system root CA certificates for user clusters.
You can now use gkectl to update vCenter CA certificates for both admin clusters and user clusters.
Fixed
Fixes:
Previously, the admin cluster upgrade could be affected by the expired front-proxy-client certificate that persists in the data disk for the admin cluster control-plane node. Now the front-proxy-client certificate is renewed during an upgrade.
Fixed an issue where logs are sent to the parent project of the service account specified in the stackdriver.serviceAccountKeyPath field of your cluster configuration file while the value of stackdriver.projectID is ignored.
Fixed an issue that Calico-node Pods sometimes use an excessive amount of CPU in large-scale clusters.
Breaking
Breaking changes:
The Istio components have been upgraded to handle ingress support. Previously, using HTTPS for ingress required both an Istio Gateway and Kubernetes Ingress. With this release, the full ingress spec is natively supported. See Ingress migration to manage this upgrade for Istio components.
The Cloud Run for Anthos user cluster configuration option is no longer supported. Cloud Run for Anthos is now installed as part of registration with a fleet. This allows for configuring and upgrading Cloud Run separately from Anthos clusters on VMware. To upgrade to the newest version of Cloud Run for Anthos, see Installing Cloud Run for Anthos .
Issue
The stackdriver-metadata-agent-cluster-level-* Pod might have logs that look like this:
reflector.go:131] third_party/golang/kubeclient/tools/cache/reflector.go:99: Failed to list *unstructured.Unstructured: the server could not find the requested resource
You can safely ignore these logs.
June 17, 2021
Issue
When you upgrade an unregistered Anthos cluster on VMware from a version earlier than 1.7.0 to a version 1.7.0 or later, you need to manually install and configure the Anthos Config Management operator. If you had previously installed Anthos Config Management, you need to re-install it. For details on how to do this, see Installing Anthos Config Management .
If you are using a private registry for software images, upgrading an Anthos cluster on VMware will always require special steps, described in Updating Anthos Config Management using a private registry. Upgrading from a version earlier than 1.7.0 to a version 1.7.0 or later additionally requires that you manually install and configure the Anthos Config Management operator as described in Installing Anthos Config Management .

The supported versions that offer the latest patches and updates for security vulnerabilities, exposures, and issues impacting Anthos clusters on VMware are 1.7, 1.6, and 1.5.
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed a bug, so that the hardware version of a virtual machine is determined based on the ESXi host apiVersion instead of the host version. When host ESXi apiVersion is at least 6.7U2, VMs with version vmx-15 are created. Also, the CSI preflight checks validate the ESXi host API version instead of the host version.
Fixed a bug, so that if vSphereCSIDisabled is set to true , Container Storage Interface (CSI) preflight checks do not run when you execute commands such as gkectl check-config or create loadbalancer or create cluster .
Fixed CVE-2021-3444 ,
CVE-2021-3449 , CVE-2021-3450 , CVE-2021-3492 , CVE-2021-3493 , and CVE-2021-29154 on the Ubuntu operating system used by the admin workstation, cluster nodes, and Seesaw.
Fixed a bug where attempting to install or upgrade GKE on-prem 1.7.0 failed with an "/STSService/ 400 Bad Request" when the vCenter is installed with the external platform services controller. Installations where the vCenter server is a single appliance are not affected. Note that VMware deprecated the external platform services controller in 2018.
Fixed a bug where auto repair failed to trigger for unhealthy nodes if the cluster-health-controller was restarted while a previously issued repair was in progress.
Fixed a bug so that the command gkectl diagnose snapshot output includes the list of containers and the containerd daemon log on Container-Optimized OS (COS) nodes.
Fixed a bug that caused gkectl update admin to generate an InternalFields diff unexpectedly.
Fixed the issue that the stackdriver-log-forwarder pod was sometimes in crashloop because of fluent-bit segfault .
Change
If you upgrade the admin cluster before you upgrade the associated user clusters within the same minor version, such as from 1.7.0 to 1.7.1, the user cluster control-planes will be upgraded together with the admin cluster. This applies even if you use the flag --force-upgrade-admin . This behavior, in versions 1.7.0 and later, is different from versions 1.6 and earlier, and is expected behavior.
April 20, 2021
Security

The supported versions offering the latest patches and updates for security vulnerabilities, exposures, and issues impacting GKE On-Prem are 1.6, 1.5, and 1.4.
Feature
Platform enhancements
GA : Node auto repair is now generally available and enabled by default for newly created clusters. When the feature is enabled, cluster-health-controller performs periodic health checks, surfaces problems as events on cluster objects, and automatically repairs unhealthy nodes.
GA : vSphere resource metrics is now generally available and enabled by default for newly created clusters. When the feature is enabled, VM level resource contention metrics are collected and displayed in the VM health dashboards automatically created through out-of-the-box monitoring. You can use these dashboards to track VM resource contention issues.
GA : Dataplane V2 is now generally available and can be enabled in newly created clusters.
GA : Network Policy Logging is now generally available. Network policy logging is available only for clusters running Dataplane V2.
You can attach vSphere tags to user cluster node pools during cluster creation and update. You can use tags to organize and select VMs in vCenter.
Feature
Simplify Day-2 operations :
GA : Support for vSphere folders is now generally available. This allows you to install Anthos clusters on VMware in a vSphere folder, reducing the scope of the permission required for the vSphere user.
A new gkectl update admin command supports updating certain admin cluster configurations including adding static IP addresses.
The central log aggregator component has been removed from the logging pipeline to improve reliability, scalability and resource usage.
Cluster scalability has been improved:
50 user clusters per admin cluster

With F5 BIG-IP, 250 nodes, 7,500 Pods, and 250 LoadBalancer Services per user cluster
Feature
Cluster lifecycle improvements
The cluster upgrade process has changed. Instead of upgrading the admin cluster first, you can upgrade user clusters to the newer version without upgrading the admin cluster. The new flow, which requires upgrading gkeadm , allows you to preview new features before performing a full upgrade with the admin cluster. In addition, the 1.7.0 version of gkectl can perform operations on both 1.6.X and 1.7.0 clusters.
Starting with version 1.7.0, you can deploy Anthos clusters on vSphere 7.0 environments in addition to vSphere 6.5 and 6.7. Note that Anthos clusters on VMware will phase out vSphere 6.5 support following VMware end of general support timelines.
Published the minimum hardware resource requirements for a proof-of-concept cluster.
Feature
Anthos Config Management :
Anthos Config Management (ACM) is now decoupled from Anthos clusters on VMware. This provides multiple benefits including decoupling the ACM release cadence from Anthos clusters on VMware, simplifying the testing and qualification process, and providing a consistent installation and upgrade flow.
Feature
Security enhancements :
Preview : You can run Container-Optimized OS on your user cluster worker nodes.
Feature
Storage enhancements :
GA : The vSphere CSI driver is now generally available. Your vCenter server and ESXi hosts must both be running 6.7 update 3 or newer. The preflight checks and gkectl diagnose cluster have been enhanced to cover the CSI prerequisites.

Calico-node Pods sometimes use an excessive amount of CPU in large-scale
clusters. You can mitigate the issue by killing such Pods.
When running gkectl update admin against a cluster upgraded from 1.6,
you might get the following diff:
- InternalFields : nil ,
- InternalFields : map [ string ] string { "features.onprem.cluster.gke.io/bundle-
vsphere-credentials" : "enabled" } ,
You can safely ignore this and proceed with the update.
Fixed
Fixes :
Fixed a bug where Grafana dashboards based on the
container_cpu_usage_seconds_total metric show no data.
Fixed an issue where scheduling Stackdriver components on user cluster control-plane nodes caused resource contention issues.
Fixed Stackdriver Daemonsets to tolerate NoSchedule and NoExecute taints.
Fixed an HTTP/2 connection issue that sometimes caused problems with connections from the kubelet to the Kubernetes API server. This issue also could lead to nodes becoming not ready.
Change
Functionality changes :
gkectl diagnose cluster now includes validation load balancing, including F5, Seesaw, and manual mode.
gkectl diagnose snapshot now provides an HTML index file in the snapshot, and collects extra container information from the admin cluster control-plane node when the Kubernetes API server is inaccessible.
gkectl update admin has been updated to:
Enable or disable auto repair in the admin cluster
Add static IP addresses to the admin cluster
Enable/disable vSphere resource metrics in the admin cluster
gkectl update cluster has been enhanced to enable or disable vSphere resource metrics in a user cluster.
Given that we no longer need an allowlisted service account in the admin workstation configuration file, we deprecated the gcp.whitelistedServiceAccountKeyPath field and added a new gcp.componentAccessServiceAccountKeyPath field. For consistency, we also renamed the corresponding gcrKeyPath field in the admin cluster configuration file.
Change
Breaking changes :
The following Google Cloud API endpoints must be allowlisted in network proxies and firewalls. These are now required for Connect Agent to authenticate to Google when the cluster is registered in Hub:
securetoken.googleapis.com
sts.googleapis.com
Iamcredentials.googleapis.com
gkectl now accepts only v1 cluster configuration files. For instructions on
converting your v0 configuration files, see Converting configuration files .

Feature
CSI volume snapshots
The CSI snapshot controllers are now automatically deployed in user clusters, enabling the users to create snapshots of persistent volumes and restore the volumes' data by provisioning new volumes from these snapshots.
Issue
Known issues:
gkectl update reverts your edits on clientconfig CR in 1.6.0. We strongly suggest that customers back up the clientconfig CR after every manual change.
Kubectl describe CSINode and gkectl diagnose snapshot might sometimes fail due to the OSS Kubernetes issue on dereferencing nil pointer fields.
The OIDC provider doesn't use the common CA by default. You must explicitly supply the CA certificate.
Upgrading the admin cluster from 1.5 to 1.6.0 breaks 1.5 user clusters that use any OIDC provider and that have no value for authentication.oidc.capath in the user cluster configuration file .
To work around this issue, run the following script, using your OIDC provider address as the IDENTITY_PROVIDER , YOUR_OIDC_PROVIDER_ADDRESS in the following script:
USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG=usercluster-kubeconfig
IDENTITY_PROVIDER=YOUR_OIDC_PROVIDER_ADDRESS
openssl s_client -showcerts -verify 5 -connect $IDENTITY_PROVIDER:443 < /dev/null | awk '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/{ if(/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/){i++}; out="tmpcert"i".pem"; print >out}'
ROOT_CA_ISSUED_CERT=$(ls tmpcert*.pem | tail -1)
ROOT_CA_CERT="/etc/ssl/certs/$(openssl x509 -in $ROOT_CA_ISSUED_CERT -noout -issuer_hash).0"
cat tmpcert*.pem $ROOT_CA_CERT > certchain.pem
CERT=$(echo $(base64 certchain.pem) | sed 's\ \\g')
rm tmpcert1.pem tmpcert2.pem
kubectl --kubeconfig $USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG patch clientconfig default -n kube-public --type json -p "[{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/authentication/0/oidc/certificateAuthorityData\", \"value\":\"${CERT}\"}]"
Change
Functionality changes:
Gkectl diagnose cluster and snapshot enhancements:
Added a --log-since flag to gkectl diagnose snapshot . Users can use it to collect logs of containers and nodes within a relative time duration in the snapshot.
Replaced the --seed-config flag with the --config flag in the gkectl diagnose cluster command. Users can use this command with the seed configuration to rule out the VIP issue and provide more debugging information of the cluster.
Added more validations in gkectl diagnose cluster .
Added iscsid support: Qualified storage drivers that previously required additional steps benefit from the default iscsi service deployment on the worker nodes.
On each cluster node, Anthos clusters on VMware now reserves 330 MiB + 5% of the node's memory capacity for operating system components and core Kubernetes components. This is an increase of 50 MiB. For more information see
Resources available for your workloads .
Breaking
Breaking changes:
kubernetes.io/anthos/apiserver_request_total is deprecated; instead, use kubernetes.io/anthos/apiserver_aggregated_request_total.

Issue
Known issues:
The version of Anthos Configuration Management included in the GKE on-prem release 1.5.1-gke.8 had initially referenced a version of the nomos image that had not been moved into the gcr.io/gke-on-prem-release repository, thus preventing a successful installation or upgrade of Anthos Configuration Management. This image has since been pushed to the repository to correct the issue for customers not using private registries. Customers using private registries will need to upgrade to 1.5.2 when it is available (scheduled for November 16, 2020) or manually copy the nomos:v1.5.1-rc.7 image into their private repository.

The user cluster control plane HA feature is now generally available.
Added kubelet and Docker health monitoring and auto repair to the Node Problem Detector .
Introduces the Node Auto Repair feature in preview to continuously detect and repair unhealthy nodes. This feature is disabled by default (opt-in) in this release.
Breaking
Breaking changes:
Starting with version 1.5, instead of using kubectl patch machinedeployment to resize the user cluster and kubectl edit cluster to add static IPs to user clusters, use gkectl update cluster to resize the worker node in user clusters and to add static IPs to user clusters.
Starting with version 1.5, the gkectl log is saved in a single file instead of multiple files by log verbosity levels. By default, the gkectl log is saved in the /home/ubuntu/.config/gke-on-prem/logs directory with a symlink created under the ./logs directory for easy access. Users can use --log_dir or --log_file to change this default setting.
Starting with version 1.5, the gkeadm log is saved in a single file instead of multiple files by log verbosity levels. By default, the gkeadm log is saved under ./logs . Users can use --log_dir or --log_file to change this default setting.
In version 1.5 only, the etcd version is updated from 3.3 to 3.4, which means the etcd image becomes smaller for improved performance and security (distroless), and the admin and user cluster etcd restore process is changed.
In 1.5 and later releases, a new firewall rule needs to be enabled from admin cluster add-on nodes to vCenter server API port 443.
Issue
Known issues:
Due to a 1.17 Kubernetes issue , kube-apiserver and kube-scheduler don't expose kubernetes_build_info on the /metrics endpoint in the 1.5 release. Customers can use Kubernetes_build_info from kube-controller-manager to get similar information like the Kubernetes major version, minor version, and build date.
Cloud Run for Anthos on-prem causes an operational outage of GKE on-prem when Cloud Run for Anthos on-prem is enabled in both installation and upgrade of GKE on-prem 1.5.0.

This release provides better product monitoring and resource usage management via the following changes:
Introduces a default monitoring dashboard .
Enables vSphere resource metrics collection by default.
Ubuntu Image now conforms with PCI DSS, NIST Baseline High, and DoD SRG IL2 compliance configurations.
Change
Functionality changes:
Enabled Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for the Istio ingress gateway.
Removed ingress controller from admin cluster.
Consolidated sysctl configs with Google Kubernetes Engine.
Added etcd defrag pod in admin cluster and user cluster, which will be responsible for monitoring etcd's database size and defragmenting it as needed. This helps reclaim etcd database size and recover etcd when its disk space is exceeded.
Feature
Simplified upgrade:
This release provides a simplified upgrade experience via the following changes:
Automatically migrate information from the previous version of admin workstation using gkeadm .
Extend preflight checks to better prepare for upgrades.
Support skip version upgrade to enable users to upgrade the cluster from any patch release of a minor release to any patch release of the next minor release. For more information about the detailed upgrade procedure and limitations, see upgrading GKE on-prem .
The alternate upgrade scenario for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures has been deprecated. All upgrades starting with version 1.3.2 need to upgrade the entire admin workstation.
The bundled load balancer is now automatically upgraded during cluster upgrade.
Feature
Improved installation and cluster configuration:
The user cluster node pools feature is now generally available.
This release improves the installation experience via the following changes:
Supports gkeadm for Windows OS.
Introduces a standalone command for creating admin clusters.
Introduce a new version of configuration files to separate admin and user cluster configurations and commands. This is designed to provide a consistent user experience and better configuration management.
Fixed
Fixes:
Fixed the issue of the user cluster's Kubernetes API server not being able to connect to kube-etcd after admin nodes and user cluster master reboot. In previous versions, kube-dns in admin clusters was configured through kubeadm. In 1.4, this configuration is moved from kubeadm to bundle, which enables deploying two kube-dns replicas on two admin nodes. As a result, a single admin node reboot/failure won't disrupt user cluster API access.
Fixed the issue that controllers such as calico-typha can't be scheduled on an admin cluster master node, when the admin cluster master node is under disk pressure.
Resolved pods failure with MatchNodeSelector on admin cluster master after node reboot or kubelet restart.
Tuned etcd quota limit settings based on the etcd data disk size and the settings in GKE Classic.
Issue
Known issues:
If a user cluster is created without any node pool named the same as the cluster, managing the node pools using gkectl update cluster would fail. To avoid this issue, when creating a user cluster, you need to name one node pool the same as the cluster.
The gkectl command might exit with panic when converting config from "/path/to/config.yaml" to v1 config files. When that occurs, you can resolve the issue by removing the unused bundled load balancer section ("loadbalancerconfig") in the config file.
When using gkeadm to upgrade an admin workstation on Windows, the info file filled out from this template needs to have the line endings converted to use Unix line endings (LF) instead of Windows line endings (CRLF). You can use Notepad++ to convert the line endings.
After upgrading an admin workstation with a static IP using gkeadm, you need to run ssh-keygen -R <admin-workstation-ip> to remove the IP from the known hosts, because the host identification changed after VM re-creation.
We have added Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for istio-ingress and istio-pilot deployments. HPA can scale up unnecessarily for istio-ingress and istio-pilot deployments during cluster upgrades. This happens because the metrics server is not able to report usage of some pods (newly created and terminating; for more information, see this Kubernetes issue ). No actions are needed; scale down will happen five minutes after the upgrade finishes.
When running a preflight check for config.yaml that contains both admincluster and usercluster sections, the "data disk" check in the "user cluster vCenter" category might fail with the message: [FAILURE] Data Disk: Data disk is not in a folder. Use a data disk in a folder when using vSAN datastore. User clusters don't use data disks, and it's safe to ignore the failure.
When upgrading the admin cluster, the preflight check for the user cluster OS image validation will fail. The user cluster OS image is not used in this case, and it's safe to ignore the "User Cluster OS Image Exists" failure in this case.
A Calico-node pod might be stuck in an unready state after node IP changes. To resolve this issue, you need to delete any unready Calico-node pods.
The BIG-IP controller might fail to update F5 VIP after any admin cluster master IP changes. To resolve this, you need to use the admin cluster master node IP in kubeconfig and delete the bigip-controller pod from the admin master.
The stackdriver-prometheus-k8s pod could enter a crashloop after host failure. To resolve this, you need to remove any corrupted PersistentVolumes that the stackdriver-prometheus-k8s pod uses.
After node IP change, pods running with hostNetwork don't get podIP corrected until Kubelet restarts. To resolve this, you need to restart Kubelet or delete those pods using previous IPs.
An admin cluster fails after any admin cluster master node IP address changes. To avoid this, you should avoid changing the admin master IP address if possible by using a static IP or a non-expired DHCP lease instead. If you encounter this issue and need further assistance, please contact Google Support.
User cluster upgrade might be stuck with the error: Failed to update machine status: no matches for kind "Machine" in version "cluster.k8s.io/v1alpha1". To resolve this, you need to delete the clusterapi pod in the user cluster namespace in the admin cluster.
Feature
Improved disaster recovery capabilities:
This release provides enhanced disaster recovery functionality to support backup and restore HA user cluster with etcd.
This release also provides a manual process to recover a single etcd replica failure in a HA cluster without any data loss.
Change
Improved scale:
This release improves the cluster scalability by supporting a maximum of 10 instead of 5 user clusters for each admin cluster .
Issue
If your vSphere environment has fewer than three hosts, user cluster upgrade might fail. To resolve this, you need to disable antiAffinityGroups in the cluster config before upgrading the user cluster. For v1 config, please set antiAffinityGroups.enabled = false ; for v0 config, please set usercluster.antiaffinitygroups.enabled = false .
Note: Disabling antiAffinityGroups in the cluster config during upgrade is only allowed for the 1.3.2 to 1.4. x upgrade to resolve the upgrade issue; the support might be removed in the future.

April 01, 2020
Issue
When upgrading from version 1.2.2 to 1.3.0 by using the Bundle download in the alternate upgrade method , a timeout might occur that will cause your user cluster upgrade to fail. To avoid this issue, you must perform the full upgrade process that includes upgrading your admin workstation with the OVA file.
March 23, 2020
Feature
In bundled load balancing mode, GKE on-prem provides and manages the Seesaw load balancer .
Feature
Added support for up to 100 nodes per user cluster .
Feature
Support for vSAN datastore on your admin and user clusters.
Feature
A new installer helps you create and prepare the admin workstation .
Feature
The Authentication Plugin for Anthos has been integrated into and replaced with the Google Cloud command-line interface, which improves the authentication process and provides the user consent flow through gcloud commands.
Feature
Anthos clusters on VMware 1.3.0-gke.16 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading GKE on-prem . GKE on-prem 1.3.0-gke.16 clusters run on Kubernetes 1.15.7-gke.32.
Feature
gkectl automatically uses the proxy URL from config.yaml to configure the proxy on the admin workstation.
Issue
Affected versions: 1.3.0-gke.16
If you configured a proxy in the config.yaml and also used a bundle other than the full bundle
( static IP |
DHCP ), you must append the --fast flag to run gkectl check-config . For example: gkectl check-config --config config.yaml --fast .
Feature
Preview Feature: Introducing User cluster Nodepools. A node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration. In GKE on-prem 1.3.0, node pools are a preview feature in the user clusters. This feature lets users create multiple node pools in a cluster, and update them as needed.
Issue
Running the 1.3 version of the gkectl diagnose command might fail if your clusters:
Are older than Anthos clusters on VMware version 1.3.
Include manually installed add-ons in the kube-system namespace.
Issue
Prometheus + Grafana: two graphs on the Machine dashboard don't work because of missing metrics: Disk Usage and Disk Available .
Feature
vSphere credential rotation is enabled. Users can now use Solution User Certificates to authenticate to GKE deployed on-prem.
Change
The metric kubelet_containers_per_pod_count is changed to a histogram metric .
Issue
All OOM events for containers trigger a SystemOOM event, even if they are container/pod OOM events. To check whether an OOM is actually a SystemOOM, check the kernel log for a message oom-kill:… . If oom_memcg=/ (instead of oom_memcg=/kubepods/… ), then it's a SystemOOM. If it's not a SystemOOM, it's safe to ignore.
Feature
The Cluster CA now signs the TLS certificates that the Kubelet API serves, and the TLS certificates are auto-rotated.
Fixed
Fixed an issue in the vSphere storage plugin that prevented vSphere storage policies from working. This is an example of how you might use this feature.
February 21, 2020
Feature
GKE on-prem version 1.2.2-gke.2 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading GKE on-prem .
Fixed
Fixed a comment about the workernode.replicas field in the GKE on-prem configuration file to say that the minimum number of worker nodes is three.
Fixed
Fixed the preflight check to correctly validate the default resource pool in the case where the resourcepool field in the GKE on-prem configuration file is empty.
Fixed
Resolved a known issue of cluster upgrade when using a vSAN datastore associated with a GKE on-prem version before 1.2
Fixed
Resolved the following warning when uploading an OS image with the VMware enableMPTSupport configuration flag set. This flag is used to indicate whether the virtual video card supports mediated passthrough.
Warning: Line 102: Unable to parse 'enableMPTSupport' for attribute 'key' on element 'Config'.
Fixed
Fixed gktctl prepare to skip checking the data disk.
Fixed
Fixed the BigQuery API service name for the preflight check service requirements validation.
Change

Fixed
Fixed gktctl check-config so that it cleans up F5 BIG-IP resources on exit.
Change
Improved gkectl check-config to validate any valid Google Cloud service accounts regardless of whether an IAM role is set.
Change
You need to use vSphere provider version 1.15 when using Terraform to create the admin workstation . vSphere provider version 1.16 introduces breaking changes that would affect all Anthos versions.
January 31, 2020
Feature
GKE on-prem version 1.2.1-gke.4 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading GKE on-prem .
This patch version includes the following changes:
Fixed
Fixes an issue that caused F5 BIG-IP VIP validation to fail due to timing out. The timeout window for F5 BIG-IP VIP validation is now longer.
Feature
Adds a preflight check that validates an NTP server is available.
Feature
gkectl check-config now automatically uploads GKE on-prem's node OS image to vSphere. You no longer need to run gkectl prepare before gkectl check-config .
Feature
Adds searchdomainsfordns field to static IPs host configuration file. searchdomainsfordns is an array of DNS search domains to use in the cluster. These domains are used as part of a domain search list.
Feature
Adds a --cleanup flag for gkectl check-config . The flag's default value is true .
Passing in --cleanup=false preserves the test VM and associated SSH keys that gkectl check-config creates for its preflight checks. Preserving the VM can be helpful for debugging.
Fixed
Fixes an issue that caused cluster upgrades to overwrite changes to add-on configurations.
Fixed
Fixes a known issue from 1.2.0-gke.6 that prevented gkectl check-config from performing all of its validations against clusters in nested resource pools or the default resource pool.
Fixed
Fixes the known issue from 1.2.0-gke.6 that affects routing updates due to the route reflector configuration.
January 28, 2020
Issue
Affected versions: 1.2.0-gke.6
In some cases, certain nodes in a user cluster fail to get routing updates from the route reflector. Consequently Pods on a node may not be able to communicate with Pods on other nodes. One possible symptom is a kube-dns resolution error.
To work around this issue, follow these steps to create a BGPPeer object in your user cluster.
Save the following BGPPeer manifest as full-mesh.yaml :
apiVersion: crd.projectcalico.org/v1
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
name: full-mesh
spec:
nodeSelector: "!has(route-reflector)"
peerSelector: "!has(route-reflector)"
Create the BGPPeer in your user cluster:
kubectl --kubeconfig [USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] apply -f full-mesh.yaml
Verify that the full-mesh BGPPeer was created:
kubectl --kubeconfig [USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] get bgppeer
The output shows full-mesh in the list of BGPPeers:
NAME AGE
full-mesh 61s
gke-group-1 3d21h
...
This issue will be fixed in version 1.2.1.
January 03, 2020
Issue
Affected versions: 1.1.0-gke.6 and later
Starting with version 1.1.0-gke.6 , the gkeconnect.proxy field is no longer in the GKE on-prem configuration file .
If you include gkeconnect.proxy in the configuration file, the gkectl check-config command can fail with this error:
[ FAILURE ] Config : Could not parse config file : error unmarshaling JSON :
while decoding JSON : json : unknown field "proxy"
To correct this issue, remove gkeconnect.proxy from the configuration file.
In versions prior to 1.1.0-gke.6, the Connect Agent used the proxy server specified in gkeconnect.proxy . Starting with version 1.1.0-gke.6, the Connect Agent uses the proxy server specified in the global proxy field.
December 20, 2019
Feature
GKE on-prem now supports VMware NSX-T version 2.4.2 .
Issue
Affected versions: All versions
Before version 1.2.0-gke.6, a known issue prevents Stackdriver from updating its configuration after cluster upgrades. Stackdriver still references an old version, which prevents Stackdriver from receiving the latest features of its telemetry pipeline. This issue can make it difficult for Google Support to troubleshoot clusters.
After you upgrade clusters to 1.2.0-gke.6, run the following command against admin and user clusters:
kubectl --kubeconfig=[KUBECONFIG] \
- n kube - system --type=json patch stackdrivers stackdriver \
- p '[{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/version"}]'
where [KUBECONFIG] is the path to the cluster's kubeconfig file.
Change
Warning: If you installed GKE on-prem versions before 1.2, and you use a vSAN datastore, you should contact Google Support before attempting an upgrade to 1.2.0-gke.6.
GKE on-prem version 1.2.0-gke.6 is now available. To upgrade, see Upgrading GKE on-prem .
This minor version includes the following changes:
Feature
Published basic installation workflow. This workflow offers a simplified workflow for quickly installing GKE on-prem using static IPs.
Fixed
Fixes an issue that prevented resuming cluster creation for HA user clusters.
Feature
Published guidelines for installing Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. CSI enables using storage devices not natively supported by Kubernetes.
Feature
Any user cluster, even your first use cluster, can now use a datastore that is separate from the admin cluster's datastore. If you specify a separate datastore for a user cluster, the user cluster nodes, PersistentVolumes (PVs) for the user cluster nodes, user control plane VMs, and PVs for the user control plane VMs all use the separate datastore.
Feature
Expanded preflight checks for validating your GKE on-prem configuration file before your create your clusters. These new checks can validate that your Google Cloud project, vSphere network, and other elements of your environment are correctly configured.
Issue
Affected versions: 1.2.0-6-gke.6
In user clusters, Prometheus and Grafana get automatically disabled during upgrade. However, the configuration and metrics data are not lost. In admin clusters, Prometheus and Grafana stay enabled.
To work around this issue, after the upgrade, open monitoring-sample for editing and set enablePrometheus to true :
1. kubectl edit monitoring --kubeconfig [USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] \ -n kube-system monitoring-sample
2.
Set the field enablePrometheus to true .
Issue
Affected versions: 1.1.0-gke.6, 1.2.0-gke.6
The stackdriver.proxyconfigsecretname field was removed in version 1.1.0-gke.6. GKE on-prem's preflight checks will return an error if the field is present in your configuration file.
To work around this, before you install or upgrade to 1.2.0-gke.6, delete the proxyconfigsecretname field from your configuration file.
Feature
The default Kubernetes version for cluster nodes is now version 1.14.7-gke.24 (previously 1.13.7-gke.20).
Feature
Updated documentation for authenticating using OpenID Connect (OIDC) with the Anthos Plugin for Kubectl. GKE on-prem's OIDC integration is now generally available.
Change
From the admin workstation, gcloud now requires that you log in to gcloud with a Google Cloud user account. The user account should have at least the Viewer IAM role in all Google Cloud projects associated with your clusters.
Change
You can now create admin and user clusters separately from one another.
Feature
GKE on-prem now supports vSphere 6.7 Update 3. Read its release notes.

Issue
In GKE On-Prem version 1.1.1-gke.2, a known issue prevents creation of clusters configured to use a Docker registry. You configure a Docker registry by populating the GKE On-Prem configuration file's privateregistryconfig field. Cluster creation fails with an error such as Failed to create root cluster: could not create external client: could not create external control plane: docker run error: exit status 125
A fix is targeted for version 1.1.2. In the meantime, if you want to create a cluster configured to use a Docker registry, pass in the --skip-validation-docker flag to gkectl create cluster .
November 05, 2019
Issue
GKE On-Prem's configuration file has a field, vcenter.datadisk , which looks for a path to a virtual machine disk (VMDK) file. During installation, you choose a name for the VMDK. By default, GKE On-Prem creates a VMDK and saves it to the root of your vSphere datastore.
If you are using a vSAN datastore, you need to create a folder in the datastore in which to save the VMDK. You provide the full path to the field—for example, datadisk: gke-on-prem/datadisk.vmdk —and GKE On-Prem saves the VMDK in that folder.
When you create the folder, vSphere assigns the folder a universally unique identifier (UUID). Although you provide the folder path to the GKE On-Prem config, the vSphere API looks for the folder's UUID. Currently, this mismatch can cause cluster creation and upgrades to fail.
A fix is targeted for version 1.1.2. In the meantime, you need to provide the folder's UUID instead of the folder's path. Follow the workaround instructions currently available in the upgrading clusters and installation topics.
October 25, 2019
Fixed
Fixed an issue that prevented clusters configured with OIDC from being upgraded.
Feature
Action required: This version upgrades the minimum gcloud version on the admin workstation to 256.0.0. You should upgrade your admin workstation . Then, you should upgrade your clusters .

Known Issues
Fixed
Fixed an issue that caused ingestion of admin cluster metrics to be slower than ingesting user cluster metrics.
Issue
For user clusters that are using static IPs and a different network than their admin cluster: If you overwrite the user cluster's network configuration, the user control plane might not be able to start. This occurs because it's using the user cluster's network, but allocates an IP address and gateway from the admin cluster.
As a workaround, you can update each user control plane's MachineDeployment specification to use the correct network. Then, delete each user control plane Machine, causing the MachineDeployment to create new Machines:
List MachineDeployments in the admin cluster
kubectl get machinedeployments --kubeconfig [ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG]
Update a user control plane MachineDeployment from your shell
kubectl edit machinedeployment --kubeconfig [ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG] [MACHINEDEPLOYMENT_NAME]
List Machines in the admin cluster
kubectl get machines --kubeconfig [ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG]

Feature
Action required: As of version 1.1.0-gke.6, GKE On-Prem now creates vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) rules for your user cluster's nodes (vSphere VMs), causing them to be spread across at least three physical hosts in your datacenter.
This feature is enabled by default for all new and existing user clusters running version 1.1.0-gke.6.
The feature requires that your vSphere environment meet the following conditions:
VMware DRS must be enabled. VMware DRS requires vSphere Enterprise Plus license edition. To learn how to enable DRS, see Creating a DRS Cluster .
The vSphere user account provided in your GKE On-Prem configuration file's vcenter field must have the Host.Inventory.EditCluster permission.
There are at least three physical hosts available.
If you do not want to enable this feature for your existing user clusters—for example, if you don't have enough hosts to accommodate the feature—perform the following steps before you upgrade your user clusters:
Open your existing GKE On-Prem configuration file.
Under the usercluster specification, add the antiaffinitygroups field as described in the antiaffinitygroups documentation :
usercluster:
...
antiaffinitygroups:
enabled: false
Save the file.
Use the configuration file to upgrade. Your clusters are upgraded, but the feature is not enabled.
Feature
The tarball that gkectl diagnose snapshot creates now includes a log of the command's output by default.

Change
vCenter certificate verification is now required. vsphereinsecure is no longer supported). You provide the certificate in the GKE On-Prem configuration file's cacertpath field.
When a client calls the vCenter server, the vCenter server must prove its identity to the client by presenting a certificate. That certificate must be signed by a certificate authority (CA). The certificate is must not be self-signed.
If you're upgrading your beta 1.4 clusters to 1.0.10, you need to provide a vCenter trusted root CA public certificate in the upgrade configuration file.
Feature
GKE On-Prem is now generally available. Version 1.0.10 includes the following changes:
Change
Upgrading from beta-1.4 to 1.0.10
Before upgrading your beta clusters to the first general availability version, perform the steps described in Installing GKE On-Prem , and review the following points:
If you are running a beta version before beta-1.4, be sure to upgrade to beta-1.4 first.
If your beta clusters are running their own L4 load balancers (not the default, F5 BIG-IP), you need to delete and recreate your clusters to run the latest GKE On-Prem version.
If your clusters were upgraded to beta-1.4 from beta-1.3, run the following command for each user cluster before upgrading:
kubectl delete crd networkpolicies.crd.projectcalico.org
vCenter certificate verification is now required. ( vsphereinsecure is no longer supported.) If you're upgrading your beta 1.4 clusters to 1.0.10, you need to provide a vCenter trusted root CA public certificate in the upgrade configuration file.
You need to upgrade all of your running clusters. For this upgrade to succeed, your clusters can't run in a mixed version state.
You need to upgrade your admin clusters to the latest version first, then upgrade your user clusters.

Issue
There is an issue that prevents the Connect agent from being updated to the new version during an upgrade. To work around this issue, run the following command after you upgrade a cluster:
kubectl delete pod gke-connect-agent-install -n gke-connect
Change
On May 8, 2019, we introduced a change to Connect, the service that enables you to interact with your GKE On-Prem clusters using Cloud Console. To use the new Connect agent, you must re-register your clusters with Cloud Console, or you must upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4.
Your GKE On-Prem clusters and the workloads running on them will continue to operate uninterrupted. However, your clusters will not be visible in Cloud Console until you re-register them or upgrade to beta-1.4.
Before you re-register or upgrade, make sure your service account has the gkehub.connect role. Also, if your service account has the old clusterregistry.connect role, it's a good idea to remove that role.
Grant your service account the gkehub.connect role:
gcloud projects add - iam - policy - binding [ PROJECT_ID ] \
--member="serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role="roles/gkehub.connect"
If your service account has the old clusterregistry.connect role, remove the old role:
gcloud projects remove - iam - policy - binding [ PROJECT_ID ] \
--member="serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role="roles/clusterregistry.connect"
Re-register your cluster, or upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4.
To re-register your cluster :
gcloud alpha container hub register - cluster [ CLUSTER_NAME ] \
--context=[USER_CLUSTER_CONTEXT] \
--service-account-key-file=[LOCAL_KEY_PATH] \
--kubeconfig-file=[KUBECONFIG_PATH] \

Known Issues
Issue
Clusters upgraded from version beta-1.2 to beta-1.3 might be affected by a known issue that damages the cluster's configuration file and prevents future cluster upgrades. This issue affects all future cluster upgrades.
You can resolve this issue by deleting and recreating clusters upgraded from beta-1.2 to beta-1.3.
To resolve the issue without deleting and recreating the cluster, you need to re-encode and apply each cluster's Secrets. Perform the following steps:
Get the contents of the create-config Secrets stored in the admin cluster. This must be done for the create-config Secret in the kube-system namespace, and for the create-config Secrets in each user cluster's namespace:
kubectl get secret create-config -n [USER_CLUSTER_NAME] -o jsonpath={.data.cfg} | base64 -d > [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret.yaml
For example:
kubectl get secret create-config -n kube-system -o jsonpath={.data.cfg} | base64 -d > kube-system_create_secret.yaml
For each user cluster, open the [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret.yaml file in an editor.
If the values for registerserviceaccountkey and connectserviceaccountkey are not REDACTED , no further action is required: the Secrets do not need to be re-encoded and written to the cluster.
Open the original create_config.yaml file in another editor.
In [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret.yaml , replace the registerserviceaccountkey and connectserviceaccountkey values with the values from the original create_config.yaml file. Save the changed file.
Repeat steps 2-4 for each [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret.yaml , and for the kube-system_create_secret.yaml file.
Base64-encode each [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret.yaml file and the kube-system_create_secret.yaml file:
cat [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret.yaml | base64 > [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret_create_secret.b64
cat kube-system-cluster_create_secret.yaml | base64 > kube-system-cluster_create_secret.b64
Replace the data[cfg] field in each Secret in the cluster with the contents of the corresponding file:
kubectl edit secret create - config - n [ USER_CLUSTER_NAME ]
# kubectl edit opens the file in the shell's default text editor
# Open `first-user-cluster_create_secret.b64` in another editor, and replace
# the `cfg` value with the copied value
# Make sure the copied string has no newlines in it
Repeat step 7 for each [USER_CLUSTER_NAME]_create_secret.yaml Secret, and for the kube-system_create_secret.yaml Secret.
To ensure that the update was successful, repeat step 1.

Change
On May 8, 2019, we introduced a change to Connect, the service that enables you to interact with your GKE On-Prem clusters using Cloud Console. To use the new Connect agent, you must re-register your clusters with Cloud Console, or you must upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4.
Your GKE On-Prem clusters and the workloads running on them will continue to operate uninterrupted. However, your clusters will not be visible in Cloud Console until you re-register them or upgrade to beta-1.4.
Before your re-register or upgrade, make sure your service account has the gkehub.connect role. Also, if your service account has the old clusterregistry.connect role, it's a good idea to remove that role.
Grant your service account the gkehub.connect role:
gcloud projects add - iam - policy - binding [ PROJECT_ID ] \
--member="serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role="roles/gkehub.connect"
If your service account has the old clusterregistry.connect role, remove the old role:
gcloud projects remove - iam - policy - binding [ PROJECT_ID ] \
--member="serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role="roles/clusterregistry.connect"
Re-register you cluster, or upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4.
To re-register your cluster:
gcloud alpha container hub register - cluster [ CLUSTER_NAME ] \
--context=[USER_CLUSTER_CONTEXT] \
--service-account-key-file=[LOCAL_KEY_PATH] \
--kubeconfig-file=[KUBECONFIG_PATH] \
--project=[PROJECT_ID]
To upgrade to GKE On-Prem beta-1.4 :
gkectl upgrade --kubeconfig [ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG]

Feature
The gkectl diagnose snapshot command now supports regular expressions for specifying namespaces.
Issue
GKE On-Prem's ingress controller uses Istio 1.1 with automatic Secret discovery. However, the node agent for Secret discovery may fail to get Secret updates after Secret deletion. So avoid deleting Secrets. If you must delete a Secret and Ingress TLS fails afterwards, manually restart the Ingress Pod in the gke-system namespace.

GKE On-Prem's Configuration Management has been upgraded from version 0.11 to 0.13. Several components of the system have been renamed. You need to take some steps to clean up the previous versions' resources and install a new instance.
If you have an active instance of Configuration Management:
Uninstall the instance:
kubectl -n=nomos-system delete nomos --all
Make sure that the instance's namespace has no resources:
kubectl -n nomos-system get all
Delete the namespace:
kubectl delete ns nomos-system
Delete the CRD:
kubectl delete crd nomos.addons.sigs.k8s.io
Delete all kube-system resources for the operator:
kubectl -n kube-system delete all -l k8s-app=nomos-operator
If you don't have an active instance of Configuration Management:
Delete the Configuration Management namespace:
kubectl delete ns nomos-system
Delete the CRD:
kubectl delete crd nomos.addons.sigs.k8s.io
Delete all kube-system resources for the operator:
kubectl -n kube-system delete all -l k8s-app=nomos-operator
Fixed
Fixed an issue where cluster networking could be interrupted when a node is removed unexpectedly.
Feature
You now install GKE On-Prem with an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) , a pre-configured virtual machine image that includes several command-line interface tools. This change makes installations easier and removes a layer of virtualization. You no longer need to run gkectl inside a Docker container.
If you installed GKE On-Prem versions before beta-1.1.1, you should create a new admin workstation following the documented instructions. After you install the new admin workstation, copy over any SSH keys, configuration files, kubeconfigs, and any other files you need, from your previous workstation to the new one.
