Admin cluster configuration file 1.29
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the fields in the admin cluster configuration file for
version 1.29 of Google Distributed Cloud.
Generating a template for your configuration file
If you used gkeadm to create your admin workstation, then gkeadm generated
a template for your admin cluster configuration file. Also, gkeadm filled in
some of the fields for you.
If you did not use gkeadm to create your admin workstation, you can use
gkectl to generate a template for your admin cluster configuration file.
To generate a template for your admin cluster configuration file:
gkectl create-config admin --config= OUTPUT_FILENAME --gke-on-prem-version= VERSION
Replace OUTPUT_FILENAME with a path of your choice for the
generated template. If you omit this flag, gkectl names the file
admin-cluster.yaml and puts it in the current directory.
Replace VERSION with the full version of a 1.29 patch
release. For example:
gkectl create-config admin --gke-on-prem-version=1.29.800-gke.108 .
This version must be be equal to or less than your gkectl version. If you omit
this flag, the generated config template is populated with values based on the
latest 1.29 patch.

Array of strings.
The maximum number of elements in the array is three.
The addresses of DNS servers for the VMs.
Example:
network:
hostConfig:
dnsServers:
- "172.16.255.1"
- "172.16.255.2"
network.hostConfig.ntpServers
Required if network.hostConfig section is filled in.

Array of strings
DNS search domains for the VMs to use. These domains are
used as part of a domain search list.
Example:
network:
hostConfig:
searchDomainsForDNS:
- "my.local.com"
network.ipMode.type
Required
Immutable
String
Prepopulated: "static"
Default: "dhcp"
If you want your cluster nodes to get their IP address from a DHCP server,
set this to "dhcp" . If you want your cluster nodes to have static IP
addresses chosen from a list that you provide, set this to "static" .
Example:
network:
ipMode:
type: "static"
network.ipMode.ipBlockFilePath
Required if network.ipMode.type = static
Immutable
String
The path of the
IP block file for your cluster.
Example:
network:
ipMode:
ipBlockFilePath: "/my-config-folder/admin-cluster-ipblock.yaml"
network.serviceCIDR
Required
Immutable
String
Smallest possible range: /24
Largest possible range: /12
Prepopulated: "10.96.232.0/24"
Default: "10.96.232.0/24"
A range of IP addresses, in CIDR format, to be used for Services in your
cluster.
Example:
network:
serviceCIDR: "10.96.232.0/24"
network.podCIDR
Required
Immutable
String
Smallest possible range: /18
Largest possible range: /8
Prepopulated: "192.168.0.0/16"
Default: "192.168.0.0/16"
A range of IP addresses, in CIDR format, to be used for Pods in your
cluster.
Example:
network:
podCIDR: "192.168.0.0/16"
The Service range must not overlap with the Pod range.
The Service and Pod ranges must not overlap with any address outside the cluster
that you want to reach from inside the cluster.
For example, suppose your Service range is 10.96.232.0/24, and your Pod range is
192.168.0.0/16. Any traffic sent from a Pod to an address in either of those
ranges will be treated as in-cluster and will not reach any destination outside
the cluster.
In particular, the Service and Pod ranges must not overlap with:
IP addresses of nodes in any cluster
IP addresses used by load balancer machines
VIPs used by control-plane nodes and load balancers
IP address of vCenter servers, DNS servers, and NTP servers
We recommend that your Service and Pod ranges be in the
RFC 1918
address space.
Here is one reason for the recommendation to use RFC 1918 addresses. Suppose
your Pod or Service range contains external IP addresses. Any traffic sent from
a Pod to one of those external addresses will be treated as in-cluster traffic
and will not reach the external destination.
network.vCenter.networkName
Required
Immutable
String

Special characters
Escape sequence
Slash ( / )
%2f
Backslash ( \ )
%5c
Percent sign ( % )
%25
If the network name is not unique in your data center, you can specify a full
path.
Example:
network:
vCenter:
networkName: "/data-centers/data-center-1/network/my-network"

String
The name of a BIG-IP partition that you created for your admin cluster.
Example:
loadBalancer:
f5BigIP:
partition: "my-f5-admin-partition"
loadBalancer.f5BigIP.snatPoolName
Optional
Relevant if loadBalancer.kind = "f5BigIp"
Immutable
String
If you are using SNAT, the name of your SNAT pool. If you are not using
SNAT, remove this field.
Example:
loadBalancer:
f5BigIP:
snatPoolName: "my-snat-pool"
loadBalancer.seesaw
Do not use this section. The Seesaw load balancer is not supported for new
admin clusters in version 1.28 and higher. Instead, we recommend that you
configure the MetalLB load balancer for new admin clusters. For more
information on configuring MetalLB, see
Bundled load balancing with MetalLB .
Although we still support Seesaw for non-HA admin clusters that have been
upgraded, we recommend that you
migrate to MetalLB .
antiAffinityGroups.enabled
Optional
Mutable
Boolean
Prepopulated: true
Set this to true to enable DRS rule creation. Otherwise, set this to
false .
Example:
antiAffinityGroups:
enabled: true
If this field is true , Google Distributed Cloud creates VMware
Distributed Resource Scheduler
(DRS) anti-affinity rules for your admin cluster nodes, causing them to be
spread across at least three physical ESXi hosts in your datacenter.
This feature requires that your vSphere environment meets the following
conditions:
VMware DRS is enabled. VMware DRS requires vSphere Enterprise Plus license
edition.
Your vSphere user account has the
Host.Inventory.Modify cluster
privilege.
There are at least four ESXi hosts available.
Even though the rule requires that the cluster nodes are spread across three
ESXi hosts, we strongly recommend that you have at least four ESXi hosts
available. This protects you from losing your admin cluster control plane. For
example, suppose you have only three ESXi hosts, and your admin cluster
control-plane node is on an ESXi host that fails. The DRS rule will prevent the
control-plane node from being placed on one of the remaining two ESXi hosts.
Recall that if you have a
vSphere Standard license ,
you cannot enable VMware DRS.
If you do not have DRS enabled, or if you do not have at least four hosts where
vSphere VMs can be scheduled, set antiAffinityGroups.enabled to false .
adminMaster

Optional
Immutable
Integer
Prepopulated: 16384
Default: 16384
The number of mebibytes of memory for each control-plane node in the admin
cluster.
Example:
adminMaster:
memoryMB: 16384
adminMaster.replicas
Required for new clusters
Immutable
Integer
Possible values: 3
The number of control-plane nodes in the admin cluster. When creating a new
admin cluster, set this field to 3 to create a high availability (HA) admin
cluster.
Example:
adminMaster:
replicas: 3
proxy
If your network is behind a proxy server, fill in this section. Otherwise,
remove this section or leave it commented out. The proxy server you specify
here is used by the user clusters that this admin cluster manages.
Immutable
proxy.url
Required if proxy section is filled in.
Immutable
String
The HTTP address of your proxy server. Include the port number even if it's the
same as the scheme's default port.
Example:
proxy:
url: "http://my-proxy.example.local:80"
The proxy server you specify here is used by your Google Distributed Cloud
clusters. Also, your admin workstation is automatically configured to use this
same proxy server unless you set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on your
admin workstation.
If you specify proxy.url , you must also specify proxy.noProxy .
After the proxy configuration for the admin cluster has been set, it cannot be
modified or deleted, unless the cluster is rebuilt.
proxy.noProxy
Optional
Immutable
String
A comma-separated list of IP addresses, IP address ranges, host names,
and domain names that should not go through the proxy server. When
Google Distributed Cloud sends a request to one of these addresses, hosts, or
domains, the request is sent directly.
Example:
proxy:
noProxy: "10.151.222.0/24,my-host.example.local,10.151.2.1"
privateRegistry
A private container
registry
is a registry where access to container images is restricted to
authenticated users. Fill in this section if your user clusters need to
access workload images. When you configure the privateRegistry section, all
user clusters managed by this admin cluster will pull workload images from the
private registry that you configure here.
If you configure the privateRegistry section, when you run gkectl prepare
before cluster creation or upgrade, gkectl pushes the Google Distributed Cloud system
images to the private registry. During the cluster creation or upgrade,
system images are pulled from the private registry. If you don't configure the
privateRegistry section, system images are pulled from
gcr.io/gke-on-prem-release using the
component access service account .
You might want to configure the privateRegistry section so that clusters pull
system images from the private registry instead of gcr.io/gke-on-prem-release
in the following cases:
You need to minimize connections to Google Cloud because of security concerns
or regulatory requirements.
Your organization requires outbound traffic to pass through a proxy server,
and the network speed to connect to Google Cloud is slow.
If you want to use Google's Artifact Registry as a private registry, see
Use Artifact Registry as a private registry for workload images
for the configuration steps.
privateRegistry.address

privateRegistry.credentials.fileRef.path
Required for private registry
Mutable
String
The path of a
credentials configuration file
that holds the username and password of an account that Google Distributed Cloud
can use to access your private registry.
Example:
privateRegistry:
credentials:
fileRef:
path: "my-config-folder/admin-creds.yaml"
privateRegistry.credentials.fileRef.entry
Required for private registry
Mutable
String
The name of the credentials block, in your
credentials configuration file ,
that holds the username and password of your private registry account.

credentials:
fileRef:
entry: "private-registry-creds"
privateRegistry.caCertPath
Required for private registry
Mutable
String
When the container runtime pulls an image from your private registry, the
registry must prove its identity by presenting a certificate. The registry's
certificate is signed by a certificate authority (CA). The container runtime
uses the CA's certificate to validate the registry's certificate.
Set this field to the path of the CA's certificate.
Example:
privateRegistry:
caCertPath: "my-cert-folder/registry-ca.crt"
componentAccessServiceAccountKeyPath
Required
Mutable
String
The path of the JSON key file for your component access service account.
Example:

gkeConnect
Required
Mutable
When you fill in the gkeConnect section, the admin cluster is automatically
registered to a fleet after it is
created. This section holds information about the Google Cloud project and service
account needed to register the cluster.
During cluster creation or update, several
RBAC policies are
configured on the admin cluster. These RBAC policies are needed so that you can
create user clusters in the Google Cloud console.
gkeConnect.projectID
Required
Immutable
String
The ID of your
fleet host project .
For new clusters, this project ID must be the same as the ID set in
stackdriver.projectID and cloudAuditLogging.projectID . If the project IDs
aren't the same, cluster creation fails. This requirement isn't applied to
existing clusters.
Example:
gkeConnect:
projectID: "my-fleet-host-project"
gkeConnect.location
Optional
Immutable
String
Default: global
Each cluster's fleet membership is managed by the Fleet service
( gkehub.googleapis.com ) and the Connect service
( gkeconnect.googleapis.com ). The location of the services can be global
or regional. In 1.28 and later, you can optionally specify the Google Cloud
region in which the Fleet and the Connect services run. If not specified,
the global instances of the services are used. Note the following:
Admin clusters created prior to 1.28 are managed by the global Fleet and
Connect services.
For new clusters, if you include this field, the region that you specify must
be the same as the region configured in cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation ,
stackdriver.clusterLocation , and gkeOnPremAPI.location . If the regions
aren't the same, cluster creation fails.
Example:

In 1.16 and later, if the GKE On-Prem API is enabled in your
Google Cloud project, all clusters in the project are
enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API
automatically in the region configured in stackdriver.clusterLocation .
If you want to enroll all clusters in the project in the GKE On-Prem API,
be sure to do the steps in
Before you begin to
activate and use the GKE On-Prem API in the project.
If you don't want to enroll the cluster in the GKE On-Prem API, include
this section and set gkeOnPremAPI.enabled to false . If you don't
want to enroll any clusters in the project, disable
gkeonprem.googleapis.com (the service name for the GKE On-Prem API)
in the project. For instructions, see
Disabling services .
Enrolling your admin cluster in the GKE On-Prem API lets you use standard
tools—the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, or
Terraform —to upgrade
user clusters that the admin cluster manages. Enrolling your cluster also lets
you run gcloud commands to
get information about your clusters .
After you add this section and create or update the admin cluster, if
subsequently you remove the section and update the cluster, the update will
fail.
gkeOnPremAPI.enabled
Required if the gkeOnPremAPI section is included.
Mutable
Boolean
Default: true
By default, the cluster is enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API if the
GKE On-Prem API is enabled in your project. Set to false if you
don't want to enroll the cluster.
After the cluster is enrolled in the GKE On-Prem API, if you need to
unenroll the cluster, make the following change and then update the cluster:
gkeOnPremAPI:
enabled: false
gkeOnPremAPI.location
Immutable
String
Default: stackdriver.clusterLocation

Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring
for your cluster, fill in this section. Otherwise remove this section.
This section is required by default. That is, if you don't include this section,
you must include the --skip-validation-stackdriver flag when you run
gkectl create admin .
This section is required in the admin cluster if you want to manage the
lifecycle of
user clusters with GKE On-Prem API clients .
stackdriver.projectID
Required for Logging and Monitoring
Immutable
String
The ID of your
fleet host project .
For new clusters, this project ID must be the same as the ID set in
gkeConnect.projectID and cloudAuditLogging.projectID . If the project IDs
aren't the same, cluster creation fails. This requirement isn't applied to
existing clusters.
If needed, you can configure a log router in this project to route logs into
log buckets in another project. For information on how to configure the log
router, see Supported destinations .
Example:

Log Router configuration. For more information about logs routing, see
Routing and storage overview .
The Stackdriver Operator ( stackdriver-operator ) attaches the value from this
field to each log entry and metric before they're routed to Google Cloud. These
attached labels can be useful for filtering your logs and metrics in the
Logs Explorer and Metrics Explorer respectively.
For new clusters, if you include the gkeOnPremAPI and cloudAuditLogging
sections in the configuration file, the region that you set here must be
the same region that you set in cloudAuditLogging.clusterLocation ,
