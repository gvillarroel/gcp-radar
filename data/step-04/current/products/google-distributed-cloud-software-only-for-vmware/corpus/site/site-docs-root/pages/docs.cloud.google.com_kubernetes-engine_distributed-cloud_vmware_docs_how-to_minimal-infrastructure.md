Set up minimal infrastructure
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This is the first part of a guide that walks you through a small
proof-of-concept installation of Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
with a single user cluster. This page is for Admins, Architects, and
Operators who set up, monitor, and manage the tech infrastructure.
To learn more about common roles and example tasks that we reference in
Google Cloud content, see
Common GKE user roles and tasks .
This document shows you how to set up minimal vSphere and Google Cloud environments for this installation and plan your IP addresses, while the follow-up Create basic clusters shows you how to create an admin workstation, an admin cluster, and a user cluster.
The infrastructure you set up using this guide might not be suitable for your actual production needs and use cases. For more information about production installations, see the Installation overview and guides.
Before you begin
Read the
Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware overview ,
which includes an overview of each component that you will install in this
setup.
See
vSphere supported versions .
See
vSphere license requirements .
For this minimal installation, a vSphere Standard license is sufficient.
You need a running instance of
vCenter Server .
You need a vCenter user account with
sufficient privileges .
Make a note of the username and password for this account.
Ensure that you're familiar with some basic Google Cloud concepts, including projects, IAM permissions, and service accounts. If not, see the following guides for more information:
Creating and managing projects
IAM overview
Service accounts
Procedure overview
These are the primary steps involved in this setup:
Set up your environment . Ensure you can meet resource requirements. We provide an example configuration for an ESXi host and vSphere datastore that meet the requirements for this installation.
Set up vSphere objects . Google Distributed Cloud components run within a vSphere object hierarchy.
Plan your IP addresses . Google Distributed Cloud requires you to provide IP addresses for all nodes, in addition to virtual IP addresses (VIPs) for administrator and user access to your deployment. For this setup you will use static IP addresses for your cluster nodes. We provide examples, though we recommend you consult with your network administrator to help you choose suitable addresses for your own network.
Configure your firewall and proxy rules
Set up Google Cloud resources , including a Google Cloud project you will use when setting up and managing Google Distributed Cloud, and a service account with the necessary permissions to access and download Google Distributed Cloud component software.
1. Set up your environment
For this minimal installation, you can use a single physical host running
ESXi .
Ensure that your host has the following minimum CPU, RAM, and storage capacity:
8 physical CPUs @ 2.7GHz hyperthreading enabled
80 gibibytes (GiB) RAM
470 GiB storage
Ensure that you have ESXi version 7.0u2 or higher installed.
Ensure that you are using vCenter Server version 7.0u2 or higher.
Example host and datastore
Here's an example of an
ESXi host
and a
vSphere
datastore
that meet the requirements:
ESXi host configuration:
Manufacturer: Dell Inc.
Physical CPUs: 8 CPUs @ 2.7 GHz
Processor type: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8168 CPU @ 2.70 GHz
Processor sockets: 2
ESXi version: 7.0u2 or later
vCenter Server version: 7.0u2 or later
Hyperthreading: enabled
Datastore configuration:
Type: VMFS 6.82
Drive type: SSD
Vendor: DELL
Drive type: logical
RAID level: RAID1
2. Set up vSphere objects
Set up the following objects in your vSphere environment:
vSphere data center
vSphere cluster
vSphere datastore
vSphere network
Make note of your vSphere data center, cluster, datastore, and network names, as you'll need these when setting up your admin workstation in Create basic clusters .
If you have set up a vSAN datastore, use govc to create a folder in your datastore directory to use for Google Distributed Cloud's virtual machine disk (VMDK):
govc datastore.mkdir -namespace=true data-disks
3. Plan your IP addresses
As you saw in the Google Distributed Cloud overview , a Google Distributed Cloud installation requires a number of IP addresses, including:
IP addresses for all nodes
Virtual IP addresses (VIPs) for access to control plane components such as Kubernetes API servers and to applications running on your user clusters
CIDR ranges for communication between Pods and Services
Because of this, an important part of setting up Google Distributed Cloud is planning your IP addresses, including making sure that you don't create any addressing conflicts. You may need your network administrator to help you find suitable values to configure, even for this simple installation. In the rest of this section we provide illustrative examples of values that work for this installation in a hypothetical network - your values will be different.
The clusters in this minimal installation use the bundled
MetalLB
load balancer. This load balancer runs on the cluster nodes, so no additional
VMs are needed for load balancing.
Google Distributed Cloud lets you choose between providing static IP addresses for your cluster nodes, or using a DHCP server. In this simple installation,
you will use static IP addresses.
Example VLAN
For this small installation, we recommend that you put your admin workstation,
admin cluster nodes, and user cluster nodes on the same VLAN in your vSphere
network. For example, suppose all IP addresses in the 172.16.20.0/24 range are
routed to a particular VLAN. Also suppose your network administrator says you
can use 172.16.20.49 - 172.16.20.69 for VMs and virtual IP addresses (VIPs).
The following diagram illustrates a VLAN that has an admin workstation, an admin
cluster, and a user cluster. Notice that VIPs aren't shown associated with any
particular node in a cluster. That is because the MetalLB load balancer can
choose which node announces the VIP for an individual Service. For example, in
the user cluster, one worker node could announce 172.16.20.64, and a different
worker node could announce 172.16.20.65.
IP addresses for an admin cluster and a user cluster (Click to enlarge)
Example IP address: admin workstation
For the admin workstation, this example uses the first address in the range
given to you by your network administrator: 172.16.20.49.
Example IP addresses: cluster nodes
The following table gives an example of how IP addresses could be used for
cluster nodes. Note that the table shows addresses for two extra nodes: admin-vm-6 and user-vm-5. The
extra nodes are needed during cluster upgrades, updates, and auto repair.
For more information, see
Manage node IP addresses .

Example IP addresses: VIP for the admin cluster
The following table gives an example of how you could specify a control-plane
VIP for your admin cluster.
VIP
Description
IP address
VIP for the Kubernetes API server of the admin cluster
Configured on the load balancer for the admin cluster.
172.16.20.58
Example IP addresses: VIPs for the user cluster
The following table gives an example of how you could specify VIPs for your user
cluster.
Notice that the VIP for the Kubernetes API server of the user cluster and the
ingress VIP are both in the same VLAN as the worker nodes and the control-plane nodes.
VIP
Description
IP address
VIP for the Kubernetes API server of the user cluster
Configured on the load balancer for the admin cluster.
172.16.20.59
Ingress VIP
Configured on the load balancer for the user cluster.
172.16.20.60
Service VIPs
Ten addresses for Services of type LoadBalancer .
Configured as needed on the load balancer for the user cluster.
Notice that this range includes the ingress VIP. This is a requirement
for the MetalLB load balancer.
172.16.20.60 - 172.16.20.69
IP addresses for Pods and Services
In addition to the IP addresses for your cluster nodes and for accessing your deployment, you also need to specify the address ranges that can be used within each cluster for in-cluster traffic.
To do this you specify a
CIDR
range to be used for Pod IP addresses and another CIDR range to be used for
the ClusterIP addresses of Kubernetes Services. These are specified as part of cluster configuration, as you will see in the next part of this guide.
As part of your IP planning, decide what CIDR ranges you want to use for Pods and Services. Unless you
have a reason to do otherwise, use the following default ranges:
Purpose Default CIDR range
Admin cluster Pods 192.168.0.0/16
User cluster Pods 192.168.0.0/16
Admin cluster Services 10.96.232.0/24
User cluster Services 10.96.0.0/20
The default values illustrate these points:
The Pod CIDR range can be the same for multiple clusters.
The Service CIDR range of a cluster must not overlap with the Service CIDR
range of any other cluster.
Typically you need more Pods than Services, so for a given cluster, you
probably want a Pod CIDR range that is larger than the Service CIDR range.
For example, the default Pod range for a user cluster has 2^(32-16) = 2^16
addresses, but the default Service range for a user cluster has only
2^(32-20) = 2^12 addresses.
Avoid overlap
In some cases you might need to use non-default CIDR ranges to avoid overlapping with IP
addresses that are reachable on your network. The Service and Pod ranges must
not overlap with any address outside the cluster that you want to reach from
inside the cluster.
For example, suppose your Service range is 10.96.232.0/24, and your Pod range is
192.168.0.0/16. Any traffic sent from a Pod to an address in either of those
ranges will be treated as in-cluster and won't reach any destination outside
the cluster.
In particular, the Service and Pod ranges must not overlap with:
IP addresses of nodes in any cluster
IP addresses used by load balancer machines
VIPs used by control-plane nodes and load balancers
IP address of vCenter servers, DNS servers, and NTP servers
We recommend that you use the internal IP address ranges defined by
RFC 1918
for your Pod and Service ranges.
Here is one reason for the recommendation to use RFC 1918 addresses. Suppose
your Pod or Service range contains external IP addresses. Any traffic sent from
a Pod to one of those external addresses will be treated as in-cluster traffic
and won't reach the external destination.
DNS server and default gateway
Before you create your admin and user clusters, you must also know the IP addresses
of:
A DNS server that can be used by your admin workstation and cluster nodes
An NTP server that can be used by your cluster nodes
The IP address of the default gateway for the subnet that has
your admin workstation and cluster nodes. For example, suppose your admin
workstation, admin cluster nodes, and user cluster nodes are all in the
172.16.20.0/24 subnet. The address of the default gateway for the subnet might
be 172.16.20.1.
4. Configure your firewall and proxy
Configure your firewall and proxy to allow necessary Google Distributed Cloud traffic, following the
Proxy and firewall rules . You will need the cluster node IP addresses that you identified in the previous section to carry out this task. Note that because the IP addresses for user and admin clusters are not assigned to specific nodes, you must make sure that all of the relevant firewall rules apply to all of the IP addresses for each cluster.
5. Set up Google Cloud resources
Google Cloud projects form the basis for creating, enabling, and using all Google Cloud services, including those used to install and manage Google Distributed Cloud. If you're not familiar with working with Google Cloud projects, you can find lots more information in Creating and managing projects .
Choose an existing Google Cloud project, or create a new one.
Make a note of the Google Cloud project ID, because it's needed later.
Set up the Google Cloud CLI
The Google Cloud CLI is a command line tool you can use to work with your project. Follow the instructions in Installing Google Cloud SDK to ensure you have the most up to date version.
Required permissions
If you are the project owner (for example, if you created the project yourself), you already have all the permissions necessary to perform the rest of this simple installation. If you are not the project owner, you or your project administrator must ensure your Google Account has the necessary permissions.
The following
IAM roles let you create a service account, assign IAM roles to it, enable APIs, and ensure that the gkeadm tool can create and
manage service accounts for you in the second part of this setup:
resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin
serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin
iam.serviceAccountCreator
iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin
For details of the permissions required to grant IAM roles yourself, see
Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources .
If you don't have these permissions, someone else in your organization must grant the roles for you.
To grant the roles:
Linux and macOS
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member="user: ACCOUNT " \
--role="roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member="user: ACCOUNT " \
--role="roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member="user: ACCOUNT " \
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member="user: ACCOUNT " \
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
Windows
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID ^
--member="user: ACCOUNT " ^
--role="roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID ^
--member="user: ACCOUNT " ^
--role="roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID ^
--member="user: ACCOUNT " ^
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID ^
--member="user: ACCOUNT " ^
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project
ACCOUNT : the identifying email address for your Google
Account
Set up service accounts
Your Google Cloud project must have four
service accounts for
Google Distributed Cloud to use. In this exercise, two of those service accounts
are generated for you automatically. But you must create the other two service
accounts manually:
Connect-register service account (Generated automatically)
Logging-monitoring service account (Generated automatically)
Audit logging service account (Create manually)
Component access service account (Create manually)
Audit logging service account
In your Google Cloud project, create a service account that
Google Distributed Cloud can use to send Kubernetes audit logs from your cluster
to Cloud Audit Logs . This is called your audit logging
service account .
gcloud iam service-accounts create audit-logging-sa \
--display-name "Audit Logging Service Account" \
--project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of your
Google Cloud project.
Get the email address of the newly-created audit logging service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts list \
--project PROJECT_ID
Create a JSON key for your audit logging service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create audit-logging-key.json \
--iam-account SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_AUDIT_LOGGING
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_AUDIT_LOGGING with the
email address of your audit logging service account.
You don't need to grant any roles to your audit logging service account.
Component access service account
In your Google Cloud project, create a service account that
Google Distributed Cloud can use to download cluster component code on your
behalf from Artifact Registry. This is called your component access
service account .
gcloud iam service-accounts create component-access-sa \
--display-name "Component Access Service Account" \
--project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of your
Google Cloud project.
Get the email address of the newly-created component access service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts list \
--project PROJECT_ID
Create a JSON key for your component access service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create component-access-key.json \
--iam-account SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_COMPONENT_ACCESS
Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_COMPONENT_ACCESS with
the email address of your component access service account.
Add the following
IAM roles
to your component access service account:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member "serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_COMPONENT_ACCESS " \
--role "roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageViewer"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member "serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_COMPONENT_ACCESS " \
--role "roles/iam.roleViewer"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member "serviceAccount: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_COMPONENT_ACCESS " \
--role "roles/iam.serviceAccountViewer"
Enable Google APIs
Enable the following Google APIs in your Google Cloud project. This lets
you use all the Google Cloud services needed by Google Distributed Cloud in
your project.
gcloud services enable --project PROJECT_ID \
anthos.googleapis.com \
anthosgke.googleapis.com \
anthosaudit.googleapis.com \
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
connectgateway.googleapis.com \
container.googleapis.com \
gkeconnect.googleapis.com \
gkehub.googleapis.com \
gkeonprem.googleapis.com \
kubernetesmetadata.googleapis.com \
serviceusage.googleapis.com \
stackdriver.googleapis.com \
opsconfigmonitoring.googleapis.com \
monitoring.googleapis.com \
logging.googleapis.com \
iam.googleapis.com \
storage.googleapis.com
If this is the first time that you have enabled the GKE On-Prem API
( gkeonprem.googleapis.com ) in your project, you need to
initialize the API . You can do this
by calling a gcloud CLI command that displays available
versions that you can use to create a user cluster:
gcloud container vmware clusters query-version-config \
--project = PROJECT_ID \
--location = "us-central1"
