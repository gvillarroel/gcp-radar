This page explains Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware storage concepts.
Summary
Google Distributed Cloud integrates with external block or file storage
systems through:
The vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver
Third party CSI drivers
Kubernetes in-tree volume plugins
vSphere datastores
When you create an admin cluster, you specify an existing vSphere
datastore
for the cluster's etcd data.
When you create a user cluster, you can use the same datastore as the admin
cluster, or you can specify a different datastore. You can also specify
datastores for individual node pools.
The vSphere datastores used by the admin and user clusters can be backed by NFS,
vSAN, or VMFS on a block device, such as an external storage array. In a
multi-host environment, each block device must be attached to all the hosts in
the environment, and the datastore must be configured on each host via the
Mount Datastore on Additional Hosts
option.
StorageClasses
When you create a
PersistentVolumeClaim ,
you can specify a StorageClass that provides information about how the storage
will be provisioned. If you don't specify a StorageClass, then the default
StorageClass gets used.
Admin cluster StorageClass
In admin clusters, there is a StorageClass named standard , and it
is designated as the default StorageClass. The standard StorageClass lists
the vSphere in-tree volume plugin as the provisioner.
To view the standard StorageClass:
kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get storageclass \
standard --output yaml
In the output, you can see that standard is the default StorageClass and
the provisioner is the vSphere in-tree volume plugin,
kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume . You can also see the name of a vSphere
datastore.
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
annotations:
storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
...
labels:
bundle.gke.io/component-name: admin-storage-class
name: standard
...
parameters:
datastore: vsanDatastore
provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
...
User cluster StorageClasses
In user clusters, there is a StorageClass named standard and another
StorageClass named standard-rwo .
The standard-rwo StorageClass is designated as the default StorageClass, and
it lists the vSphere CSI driver as the provisioner.
To view the standard-rwo StorageClass:
kubectl --kubeconfig USER_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG get storageclass \
standard-rwo --output yaml
In the output, you can see that standard-rwo is the default StorageClass and
the provisioner is the vSphere CSI driver, csi.vsphere.vmware.com . You can
also see the URL of a vSphere datastore:
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
annotations:
storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
...
labels:
bundle.gke.io/component-name: user-vsphere-csi-driver-addon
...
name: standard-rwo
...
parameters:
datastoreURL: ds:///vmfs/volumes/vsan:52fb6ca22be2454e-e67f620175964a9f/
provisioner: csi.vsphere.vmware.com
...
Note: If you set
storage.vSphereCSIDisabled
to true in the user cluster configuration file, then the cluster will not have
a StorageClass named standard-rwo . This is OK if you provide your own CSI
driver, and you don't have any PersistentVolumes that use the in-tree vSphere
storage plugin.
Kubernetes in-tree volume plugins
Kubernetes ships with a number of
in-tree volume plugin .
However, most of these in-tree volume plugins are deprecated (including
the vSphere in-tree volume plugin), for more information, see the
CSI migration
project.
CSI Migration for the vSphere storage driver
In the past, the
in-tree vSphere volume plugin
was the provisioner for the default StorageClass in user clusters. But
now the in-tree vSphere volume plugin is deprecated, and the vSphere CSI driver
is the provisioner for the default StorageClass in user clusters. We recommend
that you use the vSphere CSI driver instead of the in-tree volume plugin.
Starting in version 1.15 of Google Distributed Cloud, the Kubernetes CSI
migration feature is enabled by default for the in-tree vSphere volume plugin.
This means that if a workload uses an in-tree vSphere volume, all the internal
storage operations calls are automatically redirected to the vSphere CSI driver.
For example, suppose a PersistentVolumeClaim specifies the standard
StorageClass, which lists the vSphere in-tree volume plugin,
kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume , as the provisioner. Then any workload that uses
that PersistentVolumeClaim will have its storage operations calls redirected to
the vSphere CSI driver, csi.vsphere.vmware.com .
Preflight checks
When you create a new cluster or upgrade a cluster, there are preflight
checks that make sure your environment is suitable for CSI migration.
For example, the preflight checks:
Verify that your vCenter and ESXI versions are appropriate.
Verify that the vSphere CSI driver is enabled if there are in-tree vSphere
PersistentVolumes.
Verify that the vSphere StorageClasses don't have certain parameters that are
ignored after CSI Migration.
Verify annotations on statically created in-tree PersistentVolumes and
PersistentVolumeClaims required for CSI Migration.
Verify that the cluster can successfully run a workload using a CSI volume
provisioned by the vSphere CSI driver.
For more information, see
Running preflight checks .
Known issues
There are several known issues related to the vSphere CSI Driver. For
information and workarounds, see the Known Issues section in the
VMWare vSphere CSI Driver 3.0 release notes .
Complete migration to CSI
With the Kubernetes CSI migration feature enabled by default in 1.15, the
PersistentVolume backed by the in-tree vSphere volume plugin continue
functioning in a CSI-only environment, it just redirects in-tree plugin
operation calls to the CSI plugin. Since PersistentVolume spec is immutable,
the spec will be the same as for the in-tree volume plugin.
Due to this, the full feature set of CSI like Volume Expansion and Volume
Snapshot features are not available for such volumes. To take advantage of these
features, the stateful workload must be completely migrated to CSI by recreating
Kubernetes resource spec with CSI fields. We have developed an
automated tooling
to help migrate stateful workload to CSI without application downtime that will
allow you to use the full CSI featureset.
Using third party drivers
If you want to provision storage volumes other than vSphere datastores, you can
create a new StorageClass in a cluster that uses a different storage driver.
Then, you can
set the StorageClass as the cluster's default ,
or configure your workloads to use the StorageClass ( StatefulSet example ).
Storage partners
We have partnered with many storage vendors to qualify their storage systems
with Google Distributed Cloud. See the full list of qualified storage
partners .
Volume expansion
You can expand the size of
a persistent volume after it has been provisioned by editing the capacity
request in the PersistentVolumeClaim. You can do an online expansion while
the volume is in use by a Pod, or an offline expansion where the volume is not
in use.
For the
vSphere CSI driver ,
offline expansion is available in vSphere versions >= 7.0, and online expansion
is available in vSphere versions >= 7.0 Update 2.
The standard-rwo StorageClass sets allowVolumeExpansion to true by default
for newly created clusters running on >= vSphere 7.0. You can use both online
and offline expansion for volumes using this StorageClass. For an upgraded
cluster, because StorageClasses are not modified on cluster upgrades, when a
cluster is upgraded from 1.7 to 1.8, the allowVolumeExpansion setting in
standard-rwo remains unset, which means volume expansion is not allowed.
For more information on volume expansion, see
Using volume expansion .
CSI Volume snapshots
You can create snapshots of persistent storage by using the
VolumeSnapshot
and
VolumeSnapshotClass
resources. To use this feature on a CSI volume, the CSI driver must support
volume snapshots, and the external-snapshotter sidecar container must be
included in the CSI driver deployment.
For more information on volume snapshots, see
Using volume snapshots .
The CSI snapshot controllers are deployed automatically when you create a
cluster.
Volume cleanup
When you delete a user cluster, volumes provisioned by the vSphere CSI driver
are not deleted. You should delete all volumes, PersistentVolumeClaims,
and StatefulSets are deleted before you delete the cluster.
