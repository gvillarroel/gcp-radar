Overview
Google Distributed Cloud is based on Kubernetes and many other related technologies,
which are continuously being updated and improved to provide better scalability,
performance, security, and integration capabilities. Accordingly,
Google Distributed Cloud is constantly adapting and improving.
In version 1.30, the changes and updates have reached a point where we strongly
recommend that you migrate legacy deployments to take advantage of significant
improvements. This page describes the benefits of migrating from outdated
features to the latest recommended features.
You have the following options for each feature area:

Key points :
Starting with version 1.30, all migration solutions are available to
migrate clusters to their recommended alternatives.
When creating new clusters, here are the versions where original
features aren't allowed:
Admin clusters:
Non-HA control plane: 1.28 and higher
Seesaw load balancing: 1.28 and higher
Integrated F5 Big IP: 1.30 and higher
User clusters:
Kubeception: 1.30 and higher
Seesaw: 1.30 and higher
Integrated F5 Big IP: 1.30 and higher
Dataplane V1: 1.30 and higher
You can still upgrade existing
clusters with the original features.
Migrate user clusters to Dataplane V2
You can choose a Container Network Interface (CNI) that offers container
networking features, either Calico or
Dataplane V2 .
Dataplane V2, Google's CNI implementation, is based on
Cilium and is used in both
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Google Distributed Cloud.
Dataplane V2 provides an optimized design and efficient resource utilization,
leading to improved network performance and better scalability, particularly for
large clusters or environments with high network traffic demands. We strongly
recommend that you migrate clusters to Dataplane V2 for the latest features,
networking innovations, and capabilities.
Starting with version 1.30, Dataplane V2 is the only CNI option for creating new
clusters.
The transition from Calico to Dataplane V2 requires planning and coordination,
but it's designed to involve no downtime for existing workloads. By proactively
migrating to Dataplane V2, you can benefit from:
Enhanced Performance and Scalability: Dataplane V2's optimized
design and efficient resource utilization can lead to improved network
performance and better scalability, particularly in large clusters or
environments with high network traffic demands. This is due to the use of
EBPF instead of IPTables, which lets the cluster scale using BPF maps.
Simplified Management and Support: Standardizing on Dataplane V2
across Google Distributed Cloud and GKE can simplify
cluster management and troubleshooting, as you can rely on a consistent set
of tools and documentation.
Advanced Networking Features :
EgressNAT
and other advanced networking features are only supported on Dataplane V2.
Any future networking requests will be implemented in the Dataplane V2
layer.

Migrate load balancer type
The recommended load balancer types ( loadBalancer.kind ) are "ManualLB"
and "MetalLB" . Use "ManualLB" if you have a third-party load balancer such
as F5 BIG-IP or Citrix. Use "MetalLB" for our bundled load balancing
solution using the MetalLB load balancer .
Starting with version 1.30, these are the only options for creating new
clusters. For existing clusters that use the integrated F5 Big IP or the
bundled Seesaw load balancer, we provide migration guides to migrate the
"F5BigIP" configuration settings to "ManualLB" , and to migrate the bundled
load balancer from Seesaw to MetalLB.
Migrate configuration settings for your F5 BIG-IP load balancer
Plan to migrate any clusters that use the integrated F5 Big IP to
ManualLB . The integrated F5 Big IP uses F5 BIG-IP with load balancer
agents, which consist of the following two controllers:
F5 Controller ( pod prefix: load-balancer-f5 ): reconciles
LoadBalancer type Kubernetes Services into
F5 Common Controller Core Library (CCCL) ConfigMap
format.
F5 BIG-IP CIS Controller v1.14 ( pod prefix: k8s-bigip-ctlr-deployment ):
translates ConfigMaps into F5 load balancer configurations.
The original integrated F5 Big IP has the following limitations:
Limited Expressiveness : The integrated F5 Big IP restricts the
full potential of the F5 BIG-IP by limiting the expressiveness of the
Service API. This can prevent you from configuring the BIG-IP controller to
your specific needs or leveraging advanced F5 features that might be
crucial for your application.
Legacy Component : The current implementation relies on older
technologies like the CCCL ConfigMap API and 1.x CIS. These legacy
components might not be compatible with the latest advancements in F5's
offerings, potentially leading to missed opportunities for performance
improvements and security enhancements.
The changes after migrating from the integrated F5 BIG-IP to ManualLB include:

Note: After migration, you can continue
to create Services the same way because the F5 agents still will
be running as workloads in your cluster. The only difference
is that after migration, you manage the
lifecycle of the F5 agents.
Migrate from Seesaw to MetalLB
MetalLB provides the following advantages compared with Seesaw:
Simplified management and reduced resources : Unlike Seesaw,
MetalLB runs directly on cluster nodes, allowing for dynamic use of
cluster resources for load balancing.
Automatic IP assignment : The MetalLB controller does IP address
management for Services, so you don't have to manually choose an IP address
for each Service.
Load distribution among LB nodes : Active instances of MetalLB for
different Services can run on different nodes.
Enhanced features and future-proofing : MetalLB's active development
and integration with the broader Kubernetes ecosystem makes it a more
future-proof solution compared to Seesaw. Using MetalLB ensures that you
can take advantage of the latest advancements in load balancing technology.

Migrate user clusters to Controlplane V2 and admin clusters to HA
The recommended control plane for user clusters is Controlplane V2. With
Controlplane V2, the control plane runs on one or more nodes in the user cluster
itself. With the legacy control plane, referred to as kubeception , the control
plane for a user cluster runs in an admin cluster. To create a
high-availability (HA) admin cluster, your user clusters must have Controlplane
V2 enabled.
As of version 1.30, new user clusters are required to have Controlplane V2
enabled, and new admin clusters will be HA. Upgrades of user clusters with the
legacy control plane are still supported, as are upgrades of non-HA admin
clusters.
Migrate user clusters to Controlplane V2
Historically, user clusters have used kubeception. Version 1.13 introduced
Controlplane V2 as a preview feature, which transitioned to GA in version 1.14.
Since version 1.15, Controlplane V2 has been the default option for creating user
clusters, and Controlplane V2 is the only option in version 1.30.
Compared with kubeception, the benefits of Controlplane V2 include:
Architectural consistency : Admin clusters and user clusters use
the same architecture.
Failure isolation: An admin cluster failure does not affect user
clusters.
Operational separation: An admin cluster upgrade doesn't cause
downtime for user clusters.
Deployment separation: You can put the admin and user clusters in
different topology domains or multiple locations. For example, in an edge
computing deployment model, a user cluster might be in a different location
than the admin cluster.
During the migration, there's zero downtime for the existing user cluster
workloads. Depending on your underlying vSphere environment, the control plane
will experience minimal downtime during the switchover to Controlplane V2. The
migration process does the following:
Creates a new control plane in the user cluster.
Copies the etcd data from the old control plane.
Transitions the existing node pool nodes (also called worker nodes) to
the new control plane.

Migrate to an HA admin cluster
Historically, the admin cluster could only run a single control-plane node,
creating an inherent risk of a single point of failure. In addition to the one
control-plane node, Non-HA admin clusters also have two add-on nodes. An HA
admin cluster has three control-plane nodes with no add-on nodes, so the number
of VMs that a new admin cluster requires hasn't changed, but availability is
significantly improved. Starting with version 1.16, you can use a high
availability (HA) admin cluster, which became the only option for new cluster
creation in version 1.28.
Migrating to an HA admin cluster provides the following benefits:
Enhanced reliability and uptime: The HA configuration eliminates
the single point of failure, enabling the admin cluster to remain
operational even if one of the control-plane nodes experiences an issue.
Enhanced upgrade and update experience : All necessary steps to
upgrade and update an admin cluster are now run in-cluster, instead of in a
separate admin workstation. This makes sure upgrades and updates continue
even if the initial session to the admin workstation might be interrupted.
Reliable source of truth for cluster states : Non-HA admin clusters
rely on an out-of-band "checkpoint file" to store the admin cluster state.
In contrast, the HA admin cluster stores the up-to-date cluster state
inside the admin cluster itself, providing a more reliable source of truth
for the cluster state.
You can choose to migrate your Non-HA admin cluster to an HA admin cluster, which
involves no downtime for user workloads. The process causes minimal downtime and
disruption to existing user clusters, primarily associated with the control
plane switchover. The migration process does the following:
Creates a new HA control plane.
Restores the etcd data from the existing Non-HA cluster.
Transitions the user clusters to the new HA admin cluster.

Group load balancer and control plane migrations
Typically, when updating clusters, we recommend that you
update only one feature or setting at a time .
In version 1.30 and higher, however, you can group the configuration changes to
migration for both your load balancer and control plane, then update the cluster
just once to make both changes.
If you have user clusters using an old CNI, you first need to migrate to
DataPlane V2. After that, you can group the migration for the load balancer and
control plane. Grouping the migration provides the following benefits:
A simpler process: If you need to migrate both a control plane and load
balancer, typically you only update the cluster once. And you don't need to
decide which features you need to migrate first.
Reduce overall downtime: Certain migrations involve control plane downtime,
so grouping these migrations into one update operation reduces overall
downtime compared to doing sequential individual updates.
The process varies depending on the cluster configurations. Overall, perform the
migration for each cluster as described in the following steps:
Migrate each user cluster to use the recommended CNI, Dataplane V2.
Make the configuration changes and update the user cluster to
trigger a migration of the user cluster from the old CNI, Calico, to
Dataplane V2.
Note: This step isn't needed for the admin cluster.
When you upgrade the admin cluster to version
1.30, the cluster is automatically
migrated to Dataplane V2.
Migrate each user cluster from the old load balancer (LB) and old control
plane (CP) to use the recommended load balancer and Controlplane V2.
Make configuration changes to use the recommended load
balancer ( MetalLB or ManualLB ).
Make configuration changes to enable Controlplane V2.
Update the user cluster to migrate the load balancer and control plane.
Migrate the admin cluster to use the recommended load balancer and to make
the control plane highly available.
Make configuration changes to use the recommended load
balancer ( MetalLB or ManualLB ).
Make configuration changes to migrate the admin cluster's control
plane from Non-HA to HA.
Update the admin cluster to migrate the load balancer and control plane.
Perform optional cleanup steps, such as cleaning up the Non-HA control
plane VM.
The following diagram illustrates the migration steps:
If your admin cluster and all of your user clusters are at version 1.30 or
higher, you can use the group migration process. For detailed steps, see the
