Creating HTTP batch requests for Data Catalog
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Each HTTP connection that your application makes requires a certain amount of
overhead. Data Catalog API requests support batching, and lets
you combine several API calls into a single HTTP request. If you have many small
requests to make and want to minimize HTTP request overhead, you might want to
use HTTP batching.
Note: Batching reduces overhead, but requests within a batch still count as
multiple requests for API quota purposes.
For more information about using HTTP batch with Google Cloud, see the
Google API Python client documentation .
Note: You're limited to 1000 calls in a single batch request. If you need to
make more calls than that, use multiple batch requests.
Creating HTTP batch requests in Python
To use batch requests to create or manipulate entries in
Data Catalog, you first need to search for the entries you want
to change using catalog.search()
or entries.lookup() .
Next, follow these steps to build an HTTP batch request using the
Google Python API :
Create a BatchHttpRequest object by calling new_batch_http_request() or
with the BatchHttpRequest() constructor. You might pass in a callback, which
will be called in response to each request.
Call add() on the BatchHttpRequest object for each request you want to
execute. If you passed a callback when creating your BatchHttpRequest object,
each add() might include parameters to be passed to the callback.
After you've added the requests, call execute() on the BatchHttpRequest
object to execute them. The execute() function blocks until all callbacks have
been called.
Requests in a BatchHttpRequest might be executed in parallel, and not in the
order of execution. This means requests in the same batch shouldn't be dependent
on each other. For example, you shouldn't create an EntryGroup and Entry
belonging to it in the same request, as the creation of the Entry might
execute before the creation of the EntryGroup , causing execution to fail.
Batch requests with locational endpoints
When using HTTP batch requests with Data Catalog
locational API endpoints , all API requests
in a batch must belong to the same region. When executing the batch, you must
call the correct locational endpoint. For example, if your resources are in
us-central1 , call https://us-central1-datacatalog.googleapis.com/batch .
Note: Here "region" refers to standard regions as well as multi-regions like
"Global", "European Union", and "United States".
Region-independent APIs
Region-independent APIs, such as catalog.lookup and entries.search , can
be grouped with each other, but must not be grouped with region-dependent APIs.
For region-independent APIs, use the endpoint: https://datacatalog.googleapis.com/batch .
Example
This sample Python application demonstrates how to use an HTTP batch request to create multiple tags from a tag template using the Data Catalog API.
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.http import BatchHttpRequest
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials
import uuid
#-------------------------------------------------------------#
# 0. Helper and initialization logic
#-------------------------------------------------------------#
# Set the environment configuration.
service_key_file_location = '[SA_PATH]'
project_id = '[MY_PROJECT_ID]'
# Helper container to store results.
class DataContainer :
def __init__ ( self ):
self . data = {}
def callback ( self , request_id , response , exception ):
if exception is not None :
print ( 'request_id: {} , exception: {} ' . format ( request_id , str ( exception )))
pass
else :
print ( request_id )
self . data [ request_id ] = response
# Helper function to build the Discovery Service config.
def get_service ( api_name , api_version , scopes , key_file_location ):
"""
Get a service that communicates to a Google API.
Args:
api_name: The name of the API to connect to.
api_version: The API version to connect to.
scopes: A list auth scopes to authorize for the application.
key_file_location: The path to a valid service account JSON key file.
Returns:
A service that is connected to the specified API.
"""
credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials . from_json_keyfile_name (
key_file_location , scopes = scopes )
# Build the service object.
service = build ( api_name , api_version , credentials = credentials )
return service
# Helper function to create a UUID for each request
def generated_uui ():
return str ( uuid . uuid4 ())
def create_batch_request ( callback ):
# For more info on supported regions
# check: https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/concepts/regions
region = 'us-datacatalog.googleapis.com'
return BatchHttpRequest ( batch_uri = 'https:// {} /batch' . format ( region ), callback = callback )
container = DataContainer ()
# Scope to set up the Discovery Service config.

# Create service.

api_name = 'datacatalog' ,
api_version = 'v1' ,
scopes = [ scope ],
key_file_location = service_key_file_location )
# Create the batch request config.
batch = create_batch_request ( container . callback )
#-------------------------------------------------------------#
# 1. Start by fetching a list of entries using search call
#-------------------------------------------------------------#
# Create the search request body.
# This example searches for all BigQuery tables in a project.
search_request_body = {
'query' : 'type=TABLE system=BIGQUERY' ,
'scope' : { 'includeProjectIds' : [ project_id ]}
}
# Generated a unique ID for the request.
request_id = generated_uui ()
# Add the request to the batch client.
batch . add ( service . catalog () . search ( body = search_request_body ), request_id = request_id )
# Execute the batch request.
batch . execute ()
# Uncomment to verify the full response from search.
# print(container.data)
response = container . data [ request_id ]
results = response [ 'results' ]
first_table = results [ 0 ]
# Verify that a first table is present.
print ( first_table )
second_table = results [ 1 ]
# Verify that a second table is present
print ( second_table )
#-------------------------------------------------------------------#
# 2. Send the batch request to attach tags over the entire result set
#-------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Create a new container
container = DataContainer ()
# Create a new batch request
batch = create_batch_request ( container . callback )
# Set the template name config
template_name = 'projects/[MY_PROJECT_ID]/locations/[MY-LOCATION]/tagTemplates/[MY-TEMPLATE-NAME]'
for result in results :
# Generated a unique id for request.
request_id = generated_uui ()
# Add the entry name as the tag parent.
parent = result [ 'relativeResourceName' ]
# Create the tag request body.
create_tag_request_body = {
'template' : template_name ,
# CHANGE for your template field values.
'fields' : { 'etl_score' : { 'doubleValue' : 0.5 }}
}
# Add requests to the batch client.
batch . add ( service . projects () . locations () .
entryGroups () . entries () . tags () .
create ( body = create_tag_request_body ,
parent = parent ),
request_id = request_id )
# Execute the batch request.
# Since the Batch Client works with regions
# If you receive [HttpError 400 errors]
# 1. Verify the region you used to create the Batch client
# 2. Verify the region where the Entry is located.
# 3. verify the region of the parent tag template used by the tag.
batch . execute ()
# Uncomment to verify the full response from tag creation.
# print(container)
