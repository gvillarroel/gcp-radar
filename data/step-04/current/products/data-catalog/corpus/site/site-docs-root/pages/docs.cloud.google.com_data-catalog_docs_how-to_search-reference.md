Data Catalog search syntax
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes the syntax for Data Catalog search queries. Before you read this document, it is important that you understand the concepts of Data Catalog such as data entry, tags and tag templates, and other kinds of metadata. See What is Data Catalog? .
To launch a Data Catalog search query in the
Google Cloud console, go to the Data Catalog Search page and
select Data Catalog as the search mode.
Go to Search
Simple search
In its simplest form, a Data Catalog search query comprises a single predicate. Such a
predicate can match several pieces of metadata:
A substring of a name, display name, or description of a data asset
Exact type of a data asset
A substring of a column name (or nested column
name) in the schema of a data asset
A substring of a project ID
The value of a public tag, the name of a public tag template, or a
field name in a public tag template attached to a data entry.
(Preview) A string for an email address or name for a data steward
(Preview) A string from an overview description
The simple search does not support tag template fields of type datetime .
For example, the predicate foo matches the following entities:
Data asset with the foo.bar name
Data asset with the Foo Bar display name
Data asset with the description This is the foo script.
Data asset with the exact foo type
Column foo_bar in the schema of a data asset
Nested column foo_bar in the schema of a data asset
Project prod-foo-bar
Public tag template named foo , data entries tagged with the foo tag template, tag template display name of foo , tag template field name of foo , and tag field value of foo in a string, enum, or rich text.
(Preview) Data asset with a data steward called foo .
(Preview) Data asset with an overview containing the word foo .
To know more about the roles and permissions to view public and private tags, see Roles to view public and private tags .
Qualified predicates
You can qualify a predicate by prefixing it with a key that restricts the
matching to a specific piece of metadata.
An equal sign ( = ) restricts the search to an exact match.
A colon ( : ) after the key matches the predicate to either a substring or token within
the value in search results.
Tokenization breaks the stream of text up into a series of tokens, with
each token usually corresponding to a single word.
For example:
name:foo selects entities with names that contain the foo substring:
foo1 and barfoo .
description:foo selects entities with the foo token in the description:
bar and foo .
location=foo matches all data assets in a specified location with foo as
the location name.
Note: You can only search for an exact type=foo , system=foo , location=foo ,
or orgid=number . The corresponding predicate keys can't be followed by a
colon.
Data Catalog supports the following qualifiers:
Qualifier
Description
name:x
Matches x as a substring of the data asset ID.
displayname:x
Match x as a substring of the data asset display name.
column:x
Matches x as a substring of the column name (or nested column name) in the schema of the data asset. You can search for a nested column by its path using the AND logical operator . For example, column:(foo bar) matches a nested column with the foo.bar path.
description:x
Matches x as a token in the data asset description.
label:bar
Matches BigQuery data assets that have a label (with some value) and the label key has bar as a substring.
label=bar
Matches BigQuery data assets that have a label (with some value) and the label key equals bar as a string.
label:bar:x
Matches x as a substring in the value of a label with key bar attached to a BigQuery data asset.
label=foo:bar
Matches BigQuery data assets where the key equals foo and the key value equals bar .
label.foo=bar
Matches BigQuery data assets where the key equals foo and the key value equals bar .
label.foo
Matches BigQuery data assets that have a label whose key equals foo as a string.
type=<type>
Matches data assets of a specific object type or subtype. Subtypes can be added with the format <type>.<sub-type>. Types and subtypes include: type=table matches all tables, views, and materialized views.
type=dataset matches all datasets.
type=table.view or type=view matches all views but not materialized views.
type=materialized_view matches all materialized views.
type=lake matches all lakes.
type=zone matches all zones.
type=tag_template matches all tag templates.
type=entry_group matches all entry groups.
type=data_stream matches all Pub/Sub topics.
(Preview) type=dataset.linked matches all BigQuery sharing (formerly Analytics Hub) linked datasets.
projectid:bar
Matches data assets within Cloud projects that match bar as a substring in the ID.
parent:x
Matches x as a substring of the hierarchical path of a BigQuery data asset. The path has the format <project_id>.<dataset_name> . For example, parent:foo.bar matches all tables and views of a dataset with the path project-foo.bar-dataset .
orgid=number
Matches data assets within a Cloud organization with the exact ID value of number .
system=<system>
Matches all data assets from a specified system. Systems include: system=bigquery matches all data assets from BigQuery.
system=cloud_bigtable matches all data assets from Bigtable.
system=cloud_pubsub matches all data assets from Pub/Sub.
system=cloud_spanner matches all data assets from Spanner.
system=dataproc_metastore matches all data assets from Dataproc Metastore.
system=data_catalog matches all data assets created in Data Catalog.
system=dataplex matches all data assets created in Dataplex Universal Catalog.
location=<location>
Matches all data assets in a specified location with an exact name. For example, location=us-central1 matches all assets hosted in Iowa. For a full list of supported locations, see Data Catalog regions .
cluster_location=<location>
Matches all Bigtable data assets in a specified location with an exact name. For example, cluster_location=us-central1 matches all assets hosted in Iowa. For a full list of supported locations, see Bigtable regions .
tag:x
Matches data assets where x matches any substring in < tag_template_project_id >.< tag_template_id >.< tag_field_id > of a private or public tag. Examples: tag:data_owner matches data assets that have the data_owner tag.
tag:data_gov_template matches data assets that have been tagged with the data_gov_template tag template.
tag:mycloudproject.data_gov_template matches data assets tagged with the data_gov_template template in the mycloudproject project.
tag:key<operator>val
First, matches the key to any substring of the tag field ID, tag template ID, or Google Cloud project ID of a tag template. Then, matches val to the tag value of the key depending on the tag field type. The type-dependent <operator> sets permitted for tag values are: string/richtext : ":" Note: The colon in this string search denotes an exact token match, not a substring.
boolean and enum : "="
double : "=", "<", ">", "<=", ">="
timestamp : ":", "=", "<", ">", "<=", ">="
Examples: string : tag:data_owner:@mail.com matches data assets that have @mail.com values.
boolean : tag:data_gov_template.hasPII=true matches hasPII boolean tags in the data_gov_template that are true .
enum : tag:certification_level_1=HIGHEST .
double : tag:datascore=9 matches data assets with datascore double tags that have value 9 .
timestamp : tag:expiredDate:2019-01-01 matches data assets that have an expiredDate tag of 2019-01-01 .
timestamp : tag:expiredDate<2019-02 matches data assets that have an expiredDate tag prior to 2019-02-01T00:00:00 .
Timestamp format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss . All timestamps must be in GMT (time zones are not supported). Partial timestamps and "-" and "/" date separators are supported, for example: 2010-10-22T05:36:24

policytag:x
Match x as a substring of the policy tag display name. Finds all assets using matching policy tag or its descendants.
policytagid=x
Matches x as a policy tag or taxonomy ID. Finds all assets using matching policy tag or its descendants.
term:x
Matches data assets connected to a business glossary term where a substring of name, description, or data steward matches x .
fully_qualified_name:x
Matches x as a substring of fully_qualified_name .
fully_qualified_name=x
Matches x as fully_qualified_name .
Logical operators
A query can be comprised of several
predicates with logical operators. If you don't specify an operator, logical
AND is implied. For example, foo bar returns entities that match both
predicate foo and predicate bar .
Logical AND and logical OR are supported, for example, foo OR bar .
You can negate a predicate with a - or NOT prefix. For example, -name:foo returns
all entities with names that don't match the predicate foo .
Logical operators are not case-sensitive (for example,
"or" and "OR" are acceptable).
Abbreviated syntax
An abbreviated search syntax is also available, using | for OR operators and
, for AND operators.
For example, to search for entries inside one of many projects using the OR
operator, you can use:
projectid:(pid1|pid2|pid3|pid4)
Instead of:
projectid:pid1 OR projectid:pid2 OR projectid:pid3 OR projectid:pid4
To search for entries with matching column names:
AND: column:(name1, name2, name3)
OR: column:(name1|name2|name3)
This abbreviated syntax works for the qualified
predicates listed earlier, except for tag , term ,
policytag , policytagid and label .
