Search data assets with Data Catalog
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes how to use Data Catalog to search for
data assets.
You can search for the following data assets:
BigQuery sharing (formerly Analytics Hub) linked datasets
BigQuery datasets, tables, views, and models
Bigtable instances, clusters, and tables (including column family
details)
Data Catalog tag templates, entry groups, and
custom entries
Dataplex Universal Catalog lakes, zones, tables, and filesets
Dataproc Metastore services,
databases, and tables
Pub/Sub data streams
Spanner instances, databases, tables,
and views
Vertex AI Models, Datasets, and Vertex AI Feature Store

Search scope
You might have different search results based on your permissions.
Data Catalog search results are scoped according to your role.
The search results include those resources that belong to all organizations that
you have access to.
You can review the different types of
IAM role and permissions
available for Data Catalog. For example, if you have
BigQuery metadata read access to an object, that object appears
in your Data Catalog search results.
The following list describes the minimum permissions required to perform search:
To search for a table, you need bigquery.tables.get permission for
that table.
To search for a dataset, you need bigquery.datasets.get permission
for that dataset.
To search for metadata for a dataset or a table, you need the
roles/bigquery.metadataViewer
IAM role.
To search for all resources within a project or organization, you need
datacatalog.catalogs.searchAll permission. It works for all resources
independent of the source system.
If you have access to a BigQuery table but not to the dataset
containing that table, the table still shows up as expected in the
Data Catalog search. The same access logic applies to all
supported systems, such as Pub/Sub and Data Catalog
itself.
Recall issues in search
Data Catalog search queries don't guarantee full recall. Results
that match your query might not be returned, even in subsequent result pages.
Additionally, if you repeat search queries, returned (and not returned) results
can vary.
If you are experiencing recall issues and you don't have to fetch the
results in any specific order, consider setting the orderBy parameter to
default when calling the
catalog.search method.
Use the admin_search flag
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Using the admin_search flag on the search request ensures full recall.
Administrator search requires datacatalog.catalogs.searchAll permission to be
set on all projects and organizations in the search scope. When using
admin_search , only default orderBy is allowed.
Date-sharded tables
Data Catalog aggregates date-sharded tables into a single logical
entry. This entry has the same schema as the table shard with the most
recent date, and contains aggregate information about the total number of
shards. The entry derives its access level from the dataset it belongs to.
Data Catalog search only shows these logical entries if the user
has the access to the dataset that contains them. Individual date-sharded
tables aren't visible in Data Catalog search, even if they
are present in Data Catalog and can be tagged.
Filters
Filters let you narrow down search results. All filters are grouped in sections:
Scope to limit search to starred items only.
Systems such as BigQuery, Pub/Sub,
Dataplex Universal Catalog, Dataproc Metastore, custom systems,
Vertex AI, and Data Catalog itself.
Data Catalog system contains filesets and custom entries.
Lakes and zones come from Dataplex Universal Catalog.
Data types such as data streams, datasets, lakes, zones, filesets,
models, tables, views, services, databases, and custom types.
Projects lists all projects available to you.
Tags lists all tag templates (and their individual fields) available to
you.
Datasets come from BigQuery and Vertex AI.
Public datasets are publicly available data from BigQuery.
You can combine filters from multiple sections to find assets that match at least
one condition from every selected section. Multiple filters selected within
a single section are evaluated using the OR logical operator. For example,
consider the following filter combination:
Example that shows how filters from multiple sections can be combined.
Data Catalog looks for the following:
BigQuery datasets tagged with MyTemplate1 template.
BigQuery datasets tagged with MyTemplate2 template.
BigQuery tables tagged with MyTemplate1 template.
BigQuery tables tagged with MyTemplate2 template.
Filter by tag value
The Tags filters let you query for assets tagged using a specific template.
You can use the
playlist_add Customize
menu to further refine results and filter by specific tag values. The tag value
filter conditions depend on that tag field's data type. For example, for
datetime and number fields, you can specify a specific date or a range.
Filters visibility
The filters displayed in every section depend on the current query in the
Search box. The whole set of search results might include entries that
match the current query, but the filters that correspond to those entries
might not be shown on the Filters pane.
Note: If you change selected filters, filter sets aren't refreshed.
For example, if you select the BigQuery system in the Systems
section, Data type filters don't narrow down to the BigQuery-
specific data types, such as Table , View , and Dataset .
Search for data assets
Console
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Dataplex Universal Catalog Search page.
Go to Search
For Choose search platform , select Data Catalog as the search mode.
In the search field, enter your query or use the Filters pane to refine
the search parameters.
You can manually add the following filters:
In Projects , add a project filter. Click Add project ,
search for and select a specific project, and click Open .
In Tags , add a tag template filter. Click the
Add more tag templates menu, search for and select a specific
template, and click OK .
To search for data assets publicly available in Google Cloud in addition to
the assets available to you, select Include public datasets
Additionally, you can do the following:
Filter your search by adding a keyword : value
to your search terms in the search field:
Keyword Description
name:
Match data asset name
column:
Match column name or nested column name
description:
Match table description
Perform a tag search by adding one of the following tag
keyword prefixes to your search terms in the search field:
Tag Description
tag: project-name . tag_template_name
Match tag name
tag: project-name . tag_template_name . key
Match a tag key
tag: project-name . tag_template_name . key : value
Match tag key:string value pair
Search expression tips
Enclose your search expression in quotes (" search terms ") if it
contains spaces.
You can precede a keyword with "NOT" (all CAPS required) to match the logical
negation of the keyword:term filter. You can also use "AND" and "OR"
(all-CAPS required) boolean operators to combine search expressions.
For example: NOT column:term lists all columns except those that match the
specified term.
For a list of keywords and other terms you can use in a
Data Catalog search expression, see
Data Catalog search syntax .
Search example
Consider an example where you want to search for the trips table that you set
up in
Tag a BigQuery table by using Data Catalog :
In the search field, enter trips , and click Search .
In the Filters pane, select the following:
In the Systems section, select BigQuery to exclude data assets with
the same name that belong to other systems.
In the Projects section, select your project ID to exclude data assets
from other projects. If your project isn't displayed, click Add project
and select your project.
In the Tags section, select Demo Tag Template to check if a tag that
uses this template is attached to the trips table. If this template isn't
displayed, click the Add more tag templates , search for and select the
tag template, and click OK .
With all the selected filters, the search results contain only one
entry—the BigQuery trips table in your project with an attached
tag that uses the Demo Tag Template template.
Note: To preview the content of a BigQuery table, in the
search result, click the
manage_search next to the table.

View table details
Use Data Catalog to view table details.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Dataplex Universal Catalog Search page.
Go to Search
For Choose search platform , select Data Catalog as the search mode.
In the search box, enter the name of a dataset that has a table.
For example, if you completed the
Tag a BigQuery table by using Data Catalog
quickstart, you can search for
demo-dataset and select the trips table.
Click the table.
The BigQuery table details page opens.
The table details include the following sections:
BigQuery table details. Includes information such as
the time of creation, time of last modification, time of expiration,
resource URLs, and labels.
Tags. Lists the applied tags.You can edit the tags from this page
and view the tag template. Click the
more_vert Actions icon.
Schema and column tags. Lists the applied schema and their values.
Star your favorite entries and search for them
If you frequently browse the same data assets, you can include their entries in
a personalized list by marking them with stars.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Dataplex Universal Catalog Search
page.
Go to Search
For Choose search platform , select Data Catalog as the search mode.
Find your asset, and then star its entry in one of two ways:
Click star_border next to the
entry in the search results.
Click the entry name to open its details page and click the
star_border STAR on the
action bar at the top.
You can star up to 200 entries.
Starred entries appear in the Starred Entries list on the search page before
you enter a search query in the search bar. This list is visible only to you.
To search for only starred entries, in the Filters pane, in the Scope
section, select Starred .
You can also use the corresponding methods of
Data Catalog API to star and
unstar entries. When searching for assets, use the starredOnly parameter in
the scope object. For more information, see the
catalog.search
method.
