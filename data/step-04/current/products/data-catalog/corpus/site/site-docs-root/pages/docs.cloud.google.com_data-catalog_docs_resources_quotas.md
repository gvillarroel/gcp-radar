Quotas and limits
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document lists the quotas and limits for Data Catalog.
A quota restricts how much of a particular shared Google Cloud resource your
Google Cloud project can use, including hardware, software, and network
components. Quotas are part of a system that does the following:
Monitors your use or consumption of Google Cloud products and services.
Restricts your consumption of those resources for reasons including ensuring fairness and reducing spikes in usage.
Maintains configurations that automatically enforce prescribed restrictions.
Provides a means to make or request changes to the quota.
When a quota is exceeded, in most cases, the system immediately blocks access to
the relevant Google resource, and the task that you're trying to perform fails.
In most cases, quotas apply to each Google Cloud project and are shared across
all applications and IP addresses that use that Google Cloud project.
To increase or decrease select quotas, use the Google Cloud console. For more
information, see
Request a quota adjustment .
There are also limits on resources. These limits are unrelated to the quota
system. Limits cannot be changed unless otherwise stated.
By default, quotas and limits apply on a per-project basis.
For more information about data lineage quotas, see
Quotas for Data Lineage API requests .
Quotas
To calculate an organization's QPM (queries per minute),
Data Catalog adds together the QPM of projects in the
organization.
Data Catalog uses QPM quotas to prevent service overload
rather than control request workload distribution among projects. Therefore,
both project and organization have the same default QPM quotas. In other words,
if an organization has multiple projects and the request workload of one of them
approaches the default organization (and the same project) quota, this project
might impact the potential workload of the other projects in the organization.
To adjust organization and project quotas separately, see
Request a quota adjustment .
