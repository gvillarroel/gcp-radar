Apigee Edge documentation.
This topic is a reference for analytics metrics, dimensions, and filters. For more context on
using these, see API Analytics overview .
This topic shows the names for metrics and dimensions as they appear in the UI and as you need
to use them in API calls.
You'll see the UI names when you create and manage custom reports .
Use the API-specific names when getting metrics , creating a
report definition, or updating a report definition.
Metrics
Following are the API metrics you can retrieve in custom reports and Apigee API calls.
Metric
Name to use in the Apigee API
Functions
Description
Average transactions per second
tps
None
Average number of transactions, meaning API proxy requests, per second.
Note that if you have a relatively low
number of transactions over the time period, the average number of transactions per
second could appear to be zero in UI custom reports if the number is smaller than two
decimal places.
API syntax: tps
Cache hit
cache_hit
sum
Number of successful API requests that use the ResponseCache instead of the
response from the target service.
API syntax: sum(cache_hit)
L1 Cache elements count
ax_cache_l1_count
avg, min, max
Number of elements in L1 (in-memory) cache per transaction over a given
time period. For example, if you choose max for the period of a day, and
within that day the highest number of elements in cache is 12 for a specific transaction,
then the count will be 12. For avg , if there are three transactions in the
time period you're querying, and their cache counts are 5, 6, and 7, the average is 6. L1
cache is in-memory cache as opposed to L2 database cache, as described in Cache internals .
API syntax: avg(ax_cache_l1_count)
Policy errors
policy_error
sum
Total number of policy errors over the specified time period.
Policy errors usually occur by design. For example, the VerifyApiKey policy throws
an error when an invalid API key is passed in the request, and a SpikeArrest policy
throws an error if the number of API calls exceeds the limit defined in the policy. So
this metric is useful for finding potential trouble spots in your APIs. For example,
policy_error metrics, grouped by the developer_app dimension, might help you discover
that an API key or OAuth token has expired for a given app; or you might find that a
specific API proxy is throwing a lot of SpikeArrest policy errors, leading you to discover that
the proxy's spike arrest limit doesn't account for an increase in holiday traffic.
A policy error is logged in analytics only if the error results in API proxy failure.
For example, if a policy's continueOnError attribute is set to
true , the API proxy continues processing a request even if the policy fails.
In that case, a policy error is not logged in analytics.
The Policy Name on Error ( ax_execution_fault_policy_name ) dimension is useful for
grouping policy errors by policy name.
A target failure (such as a 404 or 503 ) does not count as a policy failure. Those
count as API proxy failures ( is_error ).
API syntax: sum(policy_error)
Proxy errors
is_error
sum
Total number of times API proxies failed over the specified time period. Proxy
failure can occur when a policy fails or when there's a runtime failure, such as a 404 or 503 from the target service.
The Proxy ( apiproxy ) dimension is useful for grouping API proxy failures by proxy.
API syntax: sum(is_error)
Request processing latency
request_processing_latency
avg, min, max
Amount of time (average, minimum, or maximum), in milliseconds ,
that it takes Apigee to process incoming requests. The time starts when the request reaches
Apigee and ends when Apigee forwards the request to the target service.
Using different dimensions, you can examine request processing latencies by API proxy,
developer app, region, and so on.
API syntax: max(request_processing_latency)
Request size
request_size
sum, avg, min, max
Size of the request payload received by Apigee, in bytes .
API syntax: avg(request_size)
Response cache executed
ax_cache_executed
sum
Total number of times a ResponseCache policy was executed over the given time
period.
Since the ResponseCache policy is attached in two places in an API proxy (once in the
request and once in the response), it usually executes twice in an API call. A cache
GET and a cache PUT each count as one execution.
However, response cache execution is 0 if the
<SkipCacheLookup>
element in the policy evaluates to true (in the request), and 0 if the
<SkipCachePopulation>
element in the policy evaluates to true (in the response).
In the Debug tool ,
you can click the ResponseCache icon in an executed API call and view the
responsecache.executed flow variable to
see whether or not there was a cache execution (a value of 1).
API syntax: sum(ax_cache_executed)
Response processing latency
response_processing_latency
avg, min, max
Amount of time (average, minimum, or maximum), in milliseconds ,
that it takes Apigee to process API responses. The time starts when the API proxy receives
the target service response and ends when Apigee forwards the response to the original
caller.
Using different dimensions, you can examine response processing latencies by API
proxy, region, and so on.
API syntax: min(response_processing_latency)
Response size
response_size
sum, avg, min, max
Size of the response payload returned to the client, in
bytes .
API syntax: max(response_size)
Target errors
target_error
sum
Total number of error responses from the target service. These are target service
errors not caused by Apigee.
API syntax: sum(target_error)
Target response time
target_response_time
sum, avg, min, max
Amount of time (sum, average, minimum, or maximum), in
milliseconds , for the target server to respond to a call. This metric
tells you how target servers are performing. The time starts when Apigee forwards a request
to the target service and ends when Apigee receives the response.
Note that if an API call returns a response from cache (using the ResponseCache
policy, for example), the call will never reach the target service, and no target
response time metrics are logged.
API syntax: avg(target_response_time)
Total response time
total_response_time
sum, avg, min, max
Amount of time (sum, average, minimum, or maximum), in
milliseconds , from when Apigee receives a request from a client to when
Apigee sends the response back to the client. The time includes network overhead (such as
the time it takes load balancers and routers to do their work), request processing
latency, response processing latency, and target response time (if the response is served
from the target service instead of cache).
Using different dimensions, you can examine processing latencies by API proxy,
developer app, region, and so on.
API syntax: avg(total_response_time)
Traffic
message_count
sum
Total number of API calls processed by Apigee in the specified time period.
Use dimensions to group traffic counts in ways that are most meaningful to you.
API syntax: sum(message_count)
Monetization
Fees
fees
sum, avg, min, max
Fee amount.
API syntax: sum(fees)
Developer share of revenue
x_apigee_mintng_dev_share
sum, avg, min, max
App developer's or AppGroup's share in a transaction's revenue.
Apigee calculates the share only if you have enabled revenue sharing in your rate plan.
The share is calculated using the following formula:
x_apigee_mintng_dev_share = revShareGrossPrice * (share percentage)
The value of the share percentage is fetched from your rate plan.
API syntax: sum(x_apigee_mintng_dev_share)
Monetization price
x_apigee_mintng_price
sum, avg, min, max
Total revenue of a transaction.
The revenue of a transaction is set to the value of the revShareGrossPrice monetization variable captured in your DataCapture policy.
API syntax: sum(x_apigee_mintng_price)
Api price multiplier
x_apigee_mintng_price_multiplier
sum, avg, min, max
The factor (multiplier) by which the
per-transaction cost is multiplied. The per-transaction cost is specified
in the rate plan's Consumption-based fees pricing.
API syntax: avg(x_apigee_mintng_price_multiplier)
Monetization rates
x_apigee_mintng_rate
sum, avg, min, max
Rate charged for a transaction.
The rate charged for a transaction is calculated using the following formula:
x_apigee_mintng_rate = (consumption-based pricing rate) * perUnitPriceMultiplier value
The value of the consumption-based pricing rate is fetched from your rate plan and the
perUnitPriceMultiplier value is multiplied only if the variable is captured by the
DataCapture policy.
API syntax: sum(x_apigee_mintng_rate)
Dimensions
Dimensions let you view metrics in meaningful groupings. For example, seeing total traffic
counts becomes much more powerful when you view them for each developer app or API proxy.
Following are the dimensions Apigee provides out of the box.
Analyze API message content using custom analytics .-->
Dimension
Name to use in the Apigee API
Description
Access Token
access_token
App end user's OAuth access token.
API Product
api_product
Name of the API product containing the API proxies being called. In order to get
this dimension, developer apps making the calls must be associated with one or more API
products that contain the API proxies, and the proxies being called must check for an API
key or OAuth token sent with the API call. The key or token is associated with an API
product. For more information, see
How do I generate complete analytics data? .
If the above criteria aren't met, you'll see the value (not set) . See also
What does an analytics entity value "(not set)" mean? .
In the context of the fees metric, this is the API product corresponding to the rate plan
for which setup fee or recurring fee apply. The value is empty for prepaid top-up.

Using AppGroups to organize app ownership for information on AppGroups.
Cache Key
ax_cache_key
Key containing the ResponseCache value that was accessed. For more information on
how the key is constructed for response cache, see ResponseCache policy .
In the Debug tool , when you select a ResponseCache policy that reads
from or writes to the cache, you can see this value in the
responsecache.cachekey
flow variable .
Cache Name
ax_cache_name
Name of the cache containing the keys/values used by the ResponseCache policy,
prefixed with orgName__envName__ . For example, if the org is myorgf , the
environment is test , and the cache name is myCache the ax_cache_name is
foo__test__myCache .
In the Debug tool ,
when you select a ResponseCache policy, you can see this value in the
responsecache.cachename flow variable .
Cache Source
ax_cache_source
Cache level (L1 in-memory or L2 database) from which the ResponseCache was
retrieved. This dimension also shows CACHE_MISS when the response was delivered from
the target instead of cache (and response cache was refreshed with the target response);
or when a cache key in the request is invalid. Cache keys are limited to
2 KB in size.
In the Debug tool ,
when you select the ResponseCache policy, you can see this value in the
responsecache.cachesource flow variable .
For more information on cache levels, see Cache internals .
Client ID
client_id
Consumer key (API key) of the developer app making the API calls, whether passed
in the request as API keys or included in OAuth tokens.
In order to get this dimension, proxies receiving calls must be configured to check
for a valid API key or OAuth token. Developer apps get API keys, which can be used to
generate OAuth tokens, when the apps are registered in Apigee. For more information, see
How do I generate complete analytics data? .
If the above criteria aren't met, you'll see the value (not set) . See also What does an analytics entity value "(not set)" mean? .
Developer App
developer_app
Apigee-registered developer app making API calls.
In order to get this dimension, apps must be associated with one or more API products
that contain the API proxies being called, and the proxies must check for an API key or
OAuth token sent with the API call. The key or token identifies the developer app. For
more information, see How do I generate complete analytics data? .
If the above criteria aren't met, you'll see the value (not set) . See also What does an analytics entity value "(not set)" mean? .
Developer Email
developer_email
Email of the Apigee-registered app developers or AppGroups whose app made the API calls.
In order to get this dimension, app developers or AppGroups must have apps associated with one or more
API products that contain the API proxies being called, and the proxies must check for an
API key or OAuth token sent with the API call. The key or token identifies the developer
app. For more information, see How do I generate complete analytics data? .
If the above criteria aren't met, you'll see the value (not set) . See also What does an analytics entity value "(not set)" mean? .
In the context of the fees metric, this is the app developer or AppGroup who is
charged with setup fee, recurring fees, or prepaid top-up.
Developer ID
developer
Unique Apigee-generated developer ID in the form
org_name @@@ unique_id . For AppGroups, the
unique_id is the AppGroup name.
In order to get this dimension, app developers and AppGroups must have apps associated with one or more
API products containing the API proxies being called, and the proxies must check for an
API key or OAuth token sent with the API calls. The key or token identifies the
app developer or AppGroup. For more information, see How do I generate complete analytics data? .
If the above criteria aren't met, you'll see the value (not set) . See also What does an analytics entity value "(not set)" mean? .
Environment
environment
Apigee environment in which the API proxies are deployed. For example, test or prod .
Fault Code on Error
ax_edge_execution_fault_code
The fault code of the error. For example:
messaging.adaptors.http.flow.GatewayTimeout
Flow Name on Error
ax_execution_fault _flow_name
Named flow in
an API proxy that raised an error. For example, PreFlow ,
PostFlow , or the name of a conditional flow you created.
Note that the full name to use in the Apigee API is
ax_execution_fault_flow_name ,
without a line break.
Where no errors occurred, you'll see the value (not set) .
Flow Resource
flow_resource
Apigee use only. See How to use "Resource Flow" Dimension in Analytics if you're curious.
Flow State on Error
ax_execution_fault _flow_state
Name of the API proxy flow states that raised errors, such as PROXY_REQ_FLOW or
TARGET_RESP_FLOW .
Note that the full name to use in the Apigee API is ax_execution_fault_flow_state ,
without a line break.
Gateway Flow ID
gateway_flow_id
As API calls move through Apigee, each call gets its own gateway flow ID. Example:
rrt329ea-12575-114653952-1. Gateway Flow ID is useful for distinguishing metrics in
high-TPS situations where other dimensions such as organization, environment, and timestamp
are identical across calls.
Organization
organization
Apigee organization in which the API proxies are deployed.
Policy Name on Error
ax_execution_fault _policy_name
Name of the policy that threw an error and caused the API call to fail.
Note that the full name to use in the Apigee API is ax_execution_fault_policy_name ,
without a line break.
If a policy throws an error but the policy root attribute continueOnError
is set to true , the API proxy flow continues without failure, and the policy
failure isn't counted in this dimension.
Proxy
apiproxy
Machine name (not the display name) of an API proxy.
Proxy Base Path
proxy_basepath
BasePath configured on the API proxy ProxyEndpoint. Base path does not include the
domain and port portion of the API proxy URL. For example, if an API proxy's base URL is
https://apigeedocs-test.apigee.net/releasenotes/ , the base path is /releasenotes .
The value is also stored in the proxy.basepath flow variable .
Proxy Deployment Type
proxy_deployment_type
The
API proxy type
for deployed proxies. Specifying a proxy type limits results to that proxy type. Potential values are STANDARD , EXTENSIBLE , or
unset.
Proxy Path Suffix
proxy_pathsuffix
Resource path added to the API proxy base path. For example, if an API proxy's
base URL is https://apigeedocs-test.apigee.net/hello/ , and a call is made to
https://apigeedocs-test.apigee.net/hello/json , the pathsuffix is
/json .
If no pathsuffix is used, the value is empty.
The value is also stored in the proxy.pathsuffix flow variable .
Proxy revision
apiproxy_revision
Revision number of the API proxy that handled API calls. This doesn't necessarily
mean the latest revision of an API proxy. If an API proxy has 10 revisions, the 8th
revision may currently be deployed. Also, an API may have multiple revisions deployed as
long as the revisions have different Base Paths, as described in Deploying proxies .
Resolved Client IP
ax_resolved_client_ip
Originating client IP address. This is either derived using the default client IP
address resolution (which only uses the X-Forwarded-For header) or the algorithm configured in
configured client IP resolution (which can resolve the IP address from any header) .
Note that when using routing products such as Akamai to capture the true IP addresses of clients,
the client IP is passed to Apigee in the HTTP header True-Client-IP , which is
then used to set the ax_true_client_ip dimension.
With the default behavior, the value of the ax_resolved_client_ip
dimension is calculated from the values in the x_forwarded_for_ip dimension in the
following manner:
Set ax_resolved_client_ip to the first non-local IP address in
x_forwarded_for_ip .
If x_forwarded_for_ip contains only local IP addresses, then set
ax_resolved_client_ip to the last local IP address in
x_forwarded_for_ip .
If x_forwarded_for_ip is null, set
ax_resolved_client_ip to (not set) .
Response Status Code
response_status_code
HTTP response status code forwarded from Apigee to the client, such as 200 , 404 ,
503 , and so on. In Apigee, the response status code from the target can be overwritten with
policies such as AssignMessage policy and RaiseFault policy ,
which is why this dimension can differ from Target Response Code (target_response_code) .
Virtual Host
virtual_host
The name of the virtual host the
API call was made to. For more information, see About environments and environment groups .
Inbound/Client
Client IP Address
client_ip
IP address of the system that hits the router, such as the original client
(proxy_client_ip) or a load balancer. When there are multiple IPs in the
X-Forwarded-For header, this is the last IP listed.
Device Category
ax_ua_device_category
Type of device from which the API call was made, such as Tablet or Smartphone .
OS Family
ax_ua_os_family
Operating system family of the device making the call, such as Android or
iOS .
OS Version
ax_ua_os_version
Operating system version of the device making the call.
It's useful to use this as a second drill-down dimension with OS Family
(ax_ua_os_family) to see the versions of the operating systems.
Proxy Client IP
proxy_client_ip
IP address of the calling client, stored in the proxy.client.ip
flow variable .
This is often the X-Forwarded-For address of the inbound call,
which is the IP address Apigee received from the last external TCP handshake. This could
be the calling client or a load balancer. When there are multiple IPs in the
X-Forwarded-For header, this is the last IP listed.
Referred Client IP
ax_true_client_ip
When using routing products such as Akamai to capture the true IP addresses of clients,
the client IPs are passed to Apigee in the HTTP header True-Client-IP . This
dimension captures those true client IPs from that header.
Request Path
request_path
Resource path (not including the domain) to the target service, excluding query
parameters.
For example, the Apigee sample target http://mocktarget.apigee.net
includes several resources, including /user , which returns a greeting.
Regardless of how your API proxy calls http://mocktarget.apigee.net/user ,
the request_path is /user .
Request URI
request_uri
Resource path (not including the domain) to the target service, including query
parameters.
For example, the Apigee sample target http://mocktarget.apigee.net
includes several resources, including /user?user={name} resource and query
parameter to return a custom greeting to the name provided. Regardless of how your API
proxy calls http://mocktarget.apigee.net/user?user=Dude , the request_uri is
/user?user=Dude .
Request Verb
request_verb
HTTP request verb in the API requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
User Agent
useragent
Name of the user agent, or software agent, used to make the API call.
Examples:
A Pixel XL making a call through Chrome: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.1.2;
Pixel XL Build/NHG47N) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.92
Mobile Safari/537.36
An iPad making a call through Chrome: Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 10_2 like Mac
OS X) AppleWebKit/602.1.50 (KHTML, like Gecko) CriOS/54.0.2840.91 Mobile/14C92
Safari/602.1
cURL from a terminal: curl/7.51.0
User Agent Family
ax_ua_agent_family
Family of the useragent, such as Chrome Mobile or curl .
User Agent Type
ax_ua_agent_type
The useragent type, such as Browser , Mobile Browser , Library , and so on.
User Agent Version
ax_ua_agent_version
Version of the useragent.
It's useful to use this as a second drill-down dimension with User Agent Family
(ax_ua_agent_family) to get the version of the agent family.
Outbound/Target
Target
target
Target endpoint that handled the request. For example, default .
Target Base Path
target_basepath
Resource path (not including the domain) to the target service, excluding query
parameters, that is defined in the proxy's <TargetEndpoint> .
For example, say an API proxy calls the following target:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
...
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net/user?user=Dude</URL>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
In this example, the target_basepath is /user .
If the target were this:
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
...
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net</URL>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
the target_basepath would be null.
In the Debug tool , when you
select the AX icon at the end of the flow diagram, the
target.basepath
flow variable maps to the
target_basepath dimension.
gRPC Service Name
x_apigee_grpc_service_name
Applicable only when the target service is gRPC. The gRPC service name. For information on gRPC
proxies, see
Creating gRPC API proxies .
gRPC Status
x_apigee_grpc_status
Applicable only when the target service is gRPC. The gRPC request status. For information on gRPC
proxies, see
Creating gRPC API proxies .
Target Host
target_host
Host of the target service. For example, if an API proxy calls
http://mocktarget.apigee.net/help , the target_host is
mocktarget.apigee.net .
Target IP Address
target_ip
IP address of the target service returning the response to the API proxy.
Target Response Code
target_response_code
HTTP response status code returned by the target service to the API proxy, such as
200 , 404 , 503 , and so on.
A value of null means the request never reached the target service. This occurs when
the response is served by the ResponseCache policy or when there's a failure in request
processing.
This is different from the Response Status Code
(response_status_code) dimension.
gRPC RPC Name
x_apigee_grpc_rpc_name
Applicable only when the target service is gRPC. The RPC name. For information on gRPC
proxies, see
Creating gRPC API proxies .
Target URL
target_url
Full URL of the target service defined in an API proxy's TargetEndpoint.
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
...
<HTTPTargetConnection>
<URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net/user?user=Dude</URL>
</HTTPTargetConnection>
In this example, the target_url is
http://mocktarget.apigee.net/user?user=Dude .
Note that the URL can also be overridden during API proxy processing with the
target.url flow variable .
In proxy
chaining , the target_url in the calling proxy is null.
X-Forwarded-For IP
x_forwarded_for_ip
The list of IP addresses in the X-Forwarded-For header.
To determine the original client IP Address, accessed through the ax_resolved_client_ip dimension, Apigee uses the values in the x_forwarded_for_ip dimension.
X-Forwarded-For Proto
x_forwarded_proto
Protocol that the client used to connect to the router. Valid values include http or https .

period_start
Start of the period for which recurring fees are charged. For example, for a monthly fee
this is the first day of the month. This value
is populated only if you have selected the Fees metric.
Period End
period_end
End of the period for which recurring fees are charged. For example, for a monthly fee
this is the last day of the month. This value
is populated only if you have selected the Fees metric.
Filters
Filters let you limit results to metrics with specific characteristics. Following are some
sample filters. Use metric and dimension API-style names when defining filters.
Note: You must put filter text between single quotes, for example,
'books' . Do not use double quotes.
Returns metrics for API proxies with the name books or music:
filter=(apiproxy in 'books','music')
Returns metrics for API proxies with names that start with m :
filter=(apiproxy like 'm%')
Returns metrics for API proxies with names that do not start with m :
filter=(apiproxy not like 'm%')
Returns metrics for API calls with response status codes between 400 and 599 :
filter=(response_status_code ge 400 and response_status_code le 599)
Returns metrics for API calls with response status code of 200 and a target response code of
404 :
filter=(response_status_code eq 200 and target_response_code eq 404)
Returns metrics for API calls with a response status code of 500 :
filter=(response_status_code eq 500)
Returns metrics for API calls that didn't result in errors:
filter=(is_error eq 0)
Returns metrics for API calls that didn't result in null responses:
filter=(response_status_code isnot null)
Following are operators you can use to build report filters.
Operator
Description
in
Include in list
notin
Exclude from list
is
Use response_status_code is null to filter for responses whose status code
is null .
isnot
Use response_status_code isnot null to filter for responses whose status
code is not null .
eq
Equals, ==
ne
Not equal to, !=
gt
Greater than, >
lt
Less than, <
ge
Greater than or equal to, >=
le
Less than or equal to, <=
like
Returns true if the string pattern matches the supplied pattern.
not like
Returns false if the string pattern matches the supplied pattern.
similar to
Returns true or false depending on whether its pattern matches the given string. It is
similar to like except that it interprets the pattern using the SQL standard's
definition of a regular expression.
not similar to
Returns false or true depending on whether its pattern matches the given string. It is
similar to not like , except that it interprets the pattern using the SQL
standard's definition of a regular expression.
and
Lets you use AND logic to include more than one filter expression. The filter
includes data that meets all the conditions.
or
Lets you use OR logic to evaluate different possible filter expressions. The filter
includes data that meets at least one of the conditions.
