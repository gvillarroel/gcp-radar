Exporting data from Analytics
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page
applies to Apigee and Apigee hybrid .
View
Apigee Edge documentation.
Apigee Analytics collects and analyzes a broad spectrum of data that flows across your APIs and provides visualization tools, including interactive dashboards, custom reports, and other tools that identify trends in API proxy performance.
Now, you can unlock this rich content by exporting analytics data from Apigee Analytics to your own data repository, such as Google Cloud Storage or Google BigQuery. You can then take advantage of the powerful query and machine learning capabilities offered by Google BigQuery and TensorFlow to perform your own data analysis. You can also combine the exported analytics data with other data, such as web logs, to gain new insights into your users, APIs, and applications.
Note: Free and trial accounts cannot export analytics data.
For more information, see Apigee pricing plans .
If you are a Pay-as-you-go customer, you must enable the Apigee API Analytics add-on in your eligible environments in order to use this API. If the Apigee API Analytics add-on is not enabled, or was disabled more than 30 days before using the API, you will see an error that you are unable to access the API. For more information, see
Manage the Apigee API Analytics add-on .
What export data formats are supported?
Export analytics data to one of the following formats:
Comma-separated values (CSV)
The default delimiter is a comma (,) character. Supported delimiter characters include comma (,), pipe (|), and tab (\t). Configure the value using the csvDelimiter property, as described in Export request property reference .
JSON (newline delimited)
Allows the newline character to be used as a delimiter.
The exported data includes all the analytics metrics and dimensions built into Apigee, and
any custom analytics data that you add. For a description of the exported data,
see Analytics metrics, dimensions, and filters reference .
You can export analytics data to the following data repositories:
Google Cloud Storage
Google BigQuery
Steps to export your analytics data
The following steps summarize the process used to export your analytics data:
Note: You must have Apigee Analytics Editor and Apigee Org Administrator permissions to manage datastores and export data.
See Understanding roles .
Configure your data repository
(Cloud Storage or BigQuery) for data export. You must ensure that your data
repository has been configured correctly, and that the Apigee Service Agent
service account used to write data to the data repository has the correct permissions.
Create a datastore that defines the properties of the data repository (Cloud Storage or BigQuery) where you export your data.
Export your analytics data . The data export runs asynchronously in the background.
View the status of the export request to determine when the export completes.
When the export is complete, access the exported data in your data repository.
The following sections describe these steps in more detail.
Configuring your data repository
Configure Cloud Storage or BigQuery to enable access by analytics data export.
Configuring Google Cloud Storage
Before you can export data to Google Cloud Storage you need to do the following:
Create a Google Cloud storage bucket .
Ensure that the BigQuery API is enabled in your Google Cloud Platform project. Apigee uses the BigQuery API to leverage BigQuery export features when exporting to Cloud Storage.
See Enabling APIs for instructions.
Ensure that the Apigee Service Agent service account with email address service- project-number @gcp-sa-apigee.iam.gserviceaccount.com is assigned to the following roles:
BigQuery Job User
Storage Admin
Note: If the service account already exists, you
don't need to create a new account—simply change the roles for
the existing account if necessary.
The project-number is listed on the project home page, as shown below.
See Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources .
Alternatively, if you want to modify an existing role, or create a custom role, add the following permissions to the role:
bigquery.jobs.create
storage.objects.create
storage.objects.delete
storage.objects.list
Note: After changing the roles of a service account you have to wait for a minute or more for the change to take effect.
Configuring Google BigQuery
Note: Analytics data for the US or EU is stored
in either the US or EU multi-region.
If you export the data to BigQuery, the
Data location for the BigQuery dataset must be the same multi-region:
If the region is part of the US, set Data location to
us (multiple regions in United States) .
If the analytics region is part of the EU, set Data location to
eu (multiple regions in European Union .
You cannot export the data directly to an individual region in the US or EU.
See
Exporting data to BigQuery for an individual region in the US or EU for
a workaround.
Before you can export data to Google BigQuery:
Ensure that you have enabled BigQuery in your Google Cloud Platform project.
Ensure that the BigQuery API is enabled in your Google Cloud Platform project.
See Enabling APIs for instructions.
Ensure that the Apigee Service Agent service account with email address service- project-number @gcp-sa-apigee.iam.gserviceaccount.com is assigned to the following roles:
BigQuery Job User
BigQuery Data Editor
Note: If the service account already exists, you
don't need to create a new account—simply change the roles for
the existing account if necessary.
The project-number is listed on the project home page, as shown below.
See Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources .
If you want to modify an existing role, or create a custom role, add the following permissions to the role:
bigquery.datasets.create
bigquery.datasets.get
bigquery.jobs.create
bigquery.tables.create
bigquery.tables.get
bigquery.tables.updateData
Note: After changing the roles of a service account you have to wait for a minute or more for the change to take effect.
Create a BigQuery dataset .
Exporting data to BigQuery for an individual region in the US or EU
Since analytics data for the US or EU is stored
in either the US or EU multi-region, you cannot export the data directly to
an individual US or EU region in BigQuery. As a workaround, you can first
export the data to Google Cloud Storage, and then transfer it to BigQuery as
follows:
Create a
Cloud Storage bucket , and set
Location to the individual region in the US or EU that you
want associated to your data in BigQuery.
Create a Cloud Storage datastore ,
using the storage bucket created in the previous step.
Export the data to Cloud Storage. See
Example 1: Export data to Cloud Storage below for an example.
Load the data to BigQuery, as described in the following sections:
Loading CSV data from Cloud Storage
Loading JSON data from Cloud Storage
Managing datastores
The datastore defines the connection to your export data repository (Cloud Storage, BigQuery).
The following sections describe how to create and manage your datastores. Before you create a datastore, it is recommended that you test the data repository configuration .
Testing the data repository configuration
When you create the data repository, Apigee does not test or validate that the configuration is valid. That means you can create the datastore (in the next step) and not detect any errors until you run your first data export.
Because a data export process can take a long time to execute, you can detect errors sooner by testing the data repository configuration to ensure it is valid, and fixing any errors before creating the datastore.
To test the data repository configuration, issue a POST request to the
/organizations/{org}/analytics/datastores:test API. Pass the following information in the request body:
Display name
Datastore type
Configuration details based on the datastore type, as described in Datastore request property reference .
Note: This is the same information that you will pass when you create a datastore .
For example, the following tests a Cloud Storage data repository configuration:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/myorg/analytics/datastores:test" \
-X POST \
-H "Content-type:application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d \
'{
"displayName": "My Cloud Storage datastore",
"targetType": "gcs",
"datastoreConfig": {
"projectId": "my-project",
"bucketName": "my-bucket",
"path": "my/analytics/path"
}
}'
The following provides an example of the response if the test is successful:
{
"state": "completed",
}
The following provides an example of the response if the test failed:
{
"state": "failed",
"error": "<error message>"
}
In this case, address the issues raised in the error message and re-test the data repository configuration. After a successful test, create the datastore, as described in the next section.
Creating a datastore
To create a datastore, issue a POST request to the
/organizations/{org}/analytics/datastores API. Pass the following information in the request body:
Display name
Datastore type
Configuration details based on the datastore type, as described in Datastore request property reference .
Examples are provided below for each datastore type.
The following provides an example of the response for a Cloud Storage data repository:
{
"self": "/organizations/myorg/analytics/datastores/c7d3b5aq-1c64-3389-9c43-b211b60de35b",

Example 1: Export data to Cloud Storage
The following example exports a complete set of raw data for the last 24 hours
from the test environment in the myorg organization.
The content is exported to Cloud Storage in JSON:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/myorg/environments/test/analytics/exports" \
-X POST \
-H "Content-type:application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d \
'{
"name": "Export raw results to Cloud Storage",
"description": "Export raw results to Cloud Storage for last 24 hours",
"dateRange": {
"start": "2020-06-08",
"end": "2020-06-09"
},
"outputFormat": "json",
"datastoreName": "My Cloud Storage data repository"
}'
Where $TOKEN is set to your OAuth 2.0 access token, as described in
Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 access token . For information about the curl options used in this example, see
Using curl . For a description of environment variables you can use, see
Setting
environment variables for Apigee API requests .

in Viewing the status of an analytics export request .
Example 2: Export data to BigQuery
Note: The Data location for the
BigQuery dataset must be the same as the analytics_location .
For analytics regions in the US or EU:
If the region is part of the US, set Data location to
us (multiple regions in United States) .
If the analytics region is part of the EU, set Data location to
eu (multiple regions in European Union) .
Note: Exporting over 100 GBs of data to BigQuery may take up to 3 to 4 minutes to complete.
The following example exports a comma-delimited CSV file to BigQuery:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/myorg/environments/test/analytics/exports" \
-X POST \
-H "Content-type:application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d \
'{
"name": "Export query results to BigQuery",
"description": "One-time export to BigQuery",
"dateRange": {
"start": "2018-06-08",
"end": "2018-06-09"
},
"outputFormat": "csv",
"csvDelimiter": ",",
"datastoreName": "My BigQuery data repository"
}'

Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 access token . For information about the curl options used in this example, see
Using curl . For a description of environment variables you can use, see
Setting
environment variables for Apigee API requests .
Note: The exported CSV file creates a BigQuery table with the following prefix:
<PREFIX>_<EXPORT_DATE>_api_<UUID>_from_<FROM_DATE>_to_<TO_DATE>
Use the URI specified by the self property to monitor the job status as described in Viewing the status of an analytics export request .
Example 3: Export monetization data
If monetization is enabled on an environment in the organization, you can perform two types of data exports:
* Standard data export as shown in the previous two examples.
* Monetization data export to export data specific to monetization.
To perform a monetization data export, specify `"dataset":"mint"` in the
request payload. The organization and environment must support monetization to set this option, otherwise
omit the `dataset` property from the payload:
'{
"name": "Export raw results to Cloud Storage",
"description": "Export raw results to Cloud Storage for last 24 hours",
"dateRange": {
"start": "2018-06-08",
"end": "2018-06-09"
},
"outputFormat": "json",
"datastoreName": "My Cloud Storage data repository",
"dataset":"mint"
}'
-->
About export API quotas
To prevent overuse of expensive data export API calls,
Apigee enforces a quota of 15 calls per day per organization on calls to the organizations/{org}/environments/{env}/analytics/exports API.
If you exceed the call quota, the API returns an HTTP 429 response.
Viewing the status of all analytics export requests
To view the status for all analytics export requests, issue a GET request to
/organizations/{org}/environments/{env}/analytics/exports .
For example, the following request returns the status of all analytics export requests for the test environment in the myorg organization:
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/myorg/environments/test/analytics/exports" \
-X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
Where $TOKEN is set to your OAuth 2.0 access token, as described in
Obtaining an OAuth 2.0 access token . For information about the curl options used in this example, see
Using curl . For a description of environment variables you can use, see
Setting
environment variables for Apigee API requests .
The following provides an example of the response listing two export requests, one enqueued (created and in the queue) and one completed:
[
{
"self" :
"/v1/organizations/myorg/environments/test/analytics/exports/e8b8db22-fe03-4364-aaf2-6d4f110444ba" ,

"description" : "One-time export to BigQuery" ,
...
}
]
For more information, see List data exports API .
Viewing the status of an analytics export request
To view the status of a specific analytics export request, issue a GET request to
/organizations/{org}/environments/{env}/analytics/exports/{exportId} ,
where {exportId} is the ID associated with the analytics export request.
Note: The URL to check the status of a request is returned in the self property when you submit an export request. To get the ID for an analytics export request, view a list of all analytics export requests and their associated IDs, as described in Viewing the status of all analytics export requests .
For example, the following request returns the status of the analytics export request with the ID 4d6d94ad-a33b-4572-8dba-8677c9c4bd98 .
curl "https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/myorg/environments/test/analytics/exports/4d6d94ad-a33b-4572-8dba-8677c9c4bd98" \
-X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
The following provides an example of the response:
{
"self" :
"/v1/organizations/myorg/environments/test/analytics/exports/4d6d94ad-a33b-4572-8dba-8677c9c4bd98" ,
