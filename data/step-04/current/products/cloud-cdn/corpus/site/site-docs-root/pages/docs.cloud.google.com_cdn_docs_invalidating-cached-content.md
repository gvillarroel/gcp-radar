Invalidate cached content
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to invalidate your Cloud CDN cached content.
For example, if a file located at /images/file.jpg has been cached and needs
to be invalidated, you can use several methods to invalidate it, depending
on whether you want to affect only that file or a wider scope. In each case,
you can invalidate for all hostnames or for only one hostname.
To learn more about cache invalidation, see
Cache invalidation overview .
Before you begin
You can use the Google Cloud CLI or the Google Cloud console to
perform invalidations.
You can access the Google Cloud CLI in two ways:
Install the Google Cloud CLI by following the instructions at
Installing with apt-get .
If you haven't used the Google Cloud CLI previously, first run
gcloud init to authenticate.
Use Cloud Shell ,
which comes with gcloud already installed.
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or the following IAM roles.
Permissions
compute.urlMaps.get
compute.urlMaps.invalidateCache
compute.urlMaps.list
Roles
roles/compute.networkAdmin
roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin
To create a custom role with the required permissions, see
Creating and managing custom roles .
To add a predefined role, use the IAM
quickstart .
Note: If you're using a global external Application Load Balancer with Shared VPC
cross-project service referencing, see
Invalidation with Shared VPC cross-project service referencing .
Invalidate only one file
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud CDN page.
Go to Cloud CDN
Click an origin.
Click the Cache invalidation tab.
For Associated load balancers , select the load balancer.
Under Specify objects to invalidate , do the following:
For Host , unless you want to invalidate the path for all
hostnames, specify a hostname.
For Path , specify the path and the filename—for example,
/images/file.jpg .
Click Invalidate .
gcloud
Use the
gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache command .
To specify only one file for invalidation, use the --path flag with the
filename.
gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache URL_MAP_NAME \
--path "/images/file.jpg"
Replace URL_MAP_NAME with the name of your
URL map. To list your URL maps, use the gcloud compute url-maps list
command.
To invalidate for only one host, add the --host flag—for
example, --host host1.com .
gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache URL_MAP_NAME \
--host host1.com \
--path "/images/file.jpg"
By default, the Google Cloud CLI waits until the invalidation has
completed. To perform the invalidation in the background, append --async
to the command line.
API
Use the
urlMaps.invalidateCache method .
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/urlMaps/ URL_MAP_NAME /invalidateCache
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud console
project ID
URL_MAP_NAME : the name of the URL map
To specify a file for invalidation, use the following sample
JSON request body:
{
"path": "/images/file.jpg"
}
To invalidate the file for only one host, use the following sample
JSON request body:
{
"host": "host1.com",
"path": "/images/file.jpg"
}
Invalidate the whole directory
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud CDN page.
Go to Cloud CDN
Click an origin.
Click the Cache invalidation tab.
For Associated load balancers , select the load balancer.
Under Specify objects to invalidate , do the following:
For Host , unless you want to invalidate the path for all
hostnames, specify a hostname.
For Path , specify the path and an asterisk as a
wildcard—for example, /images/* .
Click Invalidate .
gcloud
Use the
gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache command .
gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache URL_MAP_NAME \
--path "/images/*"
Replace URL_MAP_NAME with the name of your
URL map.
To invalidate for only one host, add the --host flag—for
example, --host host1.com .
gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache URL_MAP_NAME \
--host host1.com \
--path "/images/*"
API
Use the
urlMaps.invalidateCache method .
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/urlMaps/ URL_MAP_NAME /invalidateCache
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud console
project ID
URL_MAP_NAME : the name of the URL map
To specify a directory for invalidation, use the following sample
JSON request body:
{
"path": "/images/*"
}
To invalidate a directory for only one host, use the following
sample JSON request body:
{
"host": "host1.com",
"path": "/images/*"
}
Invalidate by cache tags
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud CDN page.
Go to Cloud CDN
Click an origin.
Click the Cache invalidation tab.
For Associated load balancers , select the load balancer.
Under Specify objects to invalidate , for Cache tags , specify
one or more tags to invalidate. Use spaces or commas to separate tags.
Click Invalidate .
gcloud
Use the
gcloud beta compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache command .
gcloud beta compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache URL_MAP_NAME \
--tags= TAGS
Replace the following:
URL_MAP_NAME : the name of the URL map
TAGS : a tag or a comma-separated list of tags;
alternatively, you can specify this flag up to 10 times
For example, if the backend response includes a Cache-Tag header with an
opaque user ID, such as a UUID4 or another form of GUID, you can
invalidate all content for a specific user by using the tag flag.
Additionally, to invalidate content for only one host, such as for your
staging environment, add the --host flag.
gcloud beta compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache url_map_1 \
--tags="1115b8f4-f804-4861-9629-8cb9aecdeeb3" \
--host="host1.com"
API
Use the
urlMaps.invalidateCache method .
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/beta/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/urlMaps/ URL_MAP_NAME /invalidateCache
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud console
project ID
URL_MAP_NAME : the name of the URL map
To specify cache tags for invalidation, use the following sample
JSON request body:
{
"cacheTags": [
"tag1",
"tag2"
]
}
You can specify a single tag or a comma-separated list of tags.
To invalidate by cache tags for only one host, use the following
sample JSON request body:
{
"host": "host1.com",
"path": "tag1,tag2"
}
Invalidate everything
Although you can invalidate everything, it's potentially risky. Evaluate your
requirements carefully before you proceed.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud CDN page.
Go to Cloud CDN
Click an origin.
Click the Cache invalidation tab.
For Associated load balancers , select the load balancer.
Under Specify objects to invalidate , do the following:
For Host , unless you want to invalidate the path for all
hostnames, specify a hostname.
For Path , use an asterisk—for example, /* .
Click Invalidate and then click Confirm to indicate that you want
Cloud CDN to invalidate everything.
gcloud
Use the
gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache command .
gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache URL_MAP_NAME \
--path " /* "
Replace the following:
URL_MAP_NAME : the name of the URL map
/* : the URL path that you want to invalidate;
doesn't include the hostname; the path can use an explicit filename
or an asterisk as a wildcard
To invalidate for only one host, add the --host flag—for
example, --host host1.com .
gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache URL_MAP_NAME \
--host host1.com \
--path " /* "
API
Use the
urlMaps.invalidateCache method .
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/urlMaps/ URL_MAP_NAME /invalidateCache
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud console
project ID
URL_MAP_NAME : the name of the URL map
To specify a URL path for invalidation, use the following sample
JSON request body:
{
"path": "/*"
}
To invalidate the URL path for only one host, use the following
sample JSON request body:
{
"host": "host1.com",
"path": "/*"
}
See the status of your invalidation request
Cloud CDN emits two log lines per invalidation, one when the
invalidation is accepted and the other when it's complete. The first has
the host and path information.
To see the status of your invalidation request or find a definitive list of
recently submitted requests, you can use Cloud Logging or Cloud Monitoring.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud CDN page.
Go to Cloud CDN
Click an origin.
Click the Cache invalidation tab.
To see the status and results of the invalidation request, click
Go to Cloud Logging .
gcloud
The following is a sample command that uses Logging to read audit logs. To enable and view audit logs, see Cloud CDN audit logging .
gcloud logging read 'protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.urlMaps.invalidateCache"' \
--limit=10
The following is a sample query that uses Monitoring:
protoPayload.serviceName="compute.googleapis.com"
protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.urlMaps.invalidateCache"
