Use negative caching
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides instructions for using negative caching with
Cloud CDN. Negative caching lets you set a different time to live (TTL)
for each status code.
The reason to do this is to apply fine-grained control over caching for common
errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origins and improve the
end-user experience by reducing response latency.
Before you begin
Read about cache modes and static content .
Ensure that Cloud CDN is enabled; for instructions, see
Using Cloud CDN .
If necessary, update to the latest version of the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud components update
Note: Make sure that you're using gcloud CLI version 316.0.0 or later.
Status codes and default TTLs
Negative caching applies to specific status codes, which are listed in the
following table.
Note: The TTL values for HTTP success codes (HTTP 2xx) are controlled by the
values of default TTL and max TTL .
Cloud CDN applies the following default TTLs to these status codes:
Status code
Meaning
TTL
HTTP 300
Multiple choices
10 minutes
HTTP 301 and 308
Permanent redirects
10 minutes
HTTP 302 and 307
Temporary redirects
Not cached by default
HTTP 404
Not found
120 seconds
HTTP 405
Method not found
60 seconds
HTTP 410
Gone
120 seconds
HTTP 451
Unavailable for legal reasons
120 seconds
HTTP 501
Not implemented
60 seconds
You can override these default values by using negative caching to set a cache
TTL for the specified HTTP status code.
Setting up negative caching
Negative caching lets you configure your service to cache failures as well as
successes. This allows Cloud CDN to shield origins from requests that
generate errors (like 404 Not Found) in the same way that it shields origins
from requests that generate successful responses.

gcloud
For backend buckets, use the gcloud compute backend-buckets
create or
gcloud compute backend-buckets
update command
with the --negative-caching flag.
For backend services, use the gcloud compute backend-services
create or
gcloud compute backend-services
update command
with the --negative-caching flag.
gcloud compute backend-buckets (create | update) BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME
--negative-caching
gcloud compute backend-services (create | update) BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME
--negative-caching
To enable negative caching of only two specific error responses,
for example, set responses with status code 404 to be cached for 60
seconds, and responses with status code 405 to be cached for 120 seconds.
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--negative-caching \
--cache-mode=CACHE_ALL_STATIC \
--default-ttl=86400 \
--negative-caching-policy='404=60,405=120'
api
For backend buckets, use the
Method: backendBuckets.insert or
Method: backendBuckets.update
API call.
For backend services, use the
Method: backendServices.insert or
Method: backendServices.update
API call.
Use one of the following API calls:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendBuckets
PUT https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendBuckets/ BACKEND_BUCKET
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendServices
PUT https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendServices/ BACKEND_SERVICE
Add the following snippet to the JSON request body:
"cdnPolicy": {
"negativeCaching": ON,
"negativeCachingPolicy": [
{
"code": STATUS_CODE ,
"ttl": TTL_SECONDS
}
]
}
Negative caching must be enabled to configure the negativeCachingPolicy
settings. If you omit the policy and have negativeCaching enabled,
Cloud CDN uses the default values listed in Status codes and default
TTLs .
When specifying a negative caching policy, make sure to specify a cache TTL for
all response codes that you want to cache. Cloud CDN doesn't apply
any default negative caching when a policy exists.
For STATUS_CODE , you can specify the following HTTP status codes:
300 , 301 , 302 , 307 , 308
404 , 405 , 410 , 421 , 451
501
For each status code, you can specify a number of seconds to cache responses.
To disable negative caching for the status code, exclude the code from your
negative caching policy.
Note: Explicitly including a code and setting the TTL to 0 disables caching,
but doing so is not recommended because the use of a TTL value of 0 in this
context is different from other uses in Cloud CDN. For example, a
max-age=0 directive in a response cache-control header means that the cache
must always revalidate the response, rather than that the response is not
cacehable.
The maximum allowed value is 1800 seconds (30 minutes); however, infrequently
accessed objects might be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS ,
negative caching is applied to responses with specific HTTP status codes,
such as 302 , 404 , or 501 . The duration for which these negative
responses are cached is determined by the following rule of precedence:
If the negative response from the origin includes explicit Cache-Control or
Expires response headers, Cloud CDN caches the negative response
for the duration specified by these headers.
For example, if your origin returns 404 Not Found with a
Cache-Control: public,max-age=60 setting, the 404 status code is cached
for 60 seconds, and the negative caching policy is ignored for that
specific request.
If the negative response from the origin doesn't have any Cache-Control or
Expires headers, Cloud CDN applies the configured negative caching
policy TTLs. For example, if your origin returns 404 Not Found with no
caching headers, the response is cached for the TTL specified in
cdnPolicy.negativeCachingPolicy for the 404 status code .
When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL , negative caching overrides any
caching headers set by the origin. Cloud CDN caches the response
for the length of time specified by the TTL, or doesn't cache it if no TTL is
set.
In addition, when the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL , Cloud CDN
also modifies the max-age sent to the client in the Cache-Control
header. In particular, if a given error has a configured TTL setting,
Cloud CDN considers the lower TTL value and the client_ttl
configuration and sends a Cache-Control: public,max-age=N header with
that value. If a given error doesn't have a configured TTL setting,
Cloud CDN removes any Cache-Control header sent by the
origin. Cloud CDN also always removes any Expires header sent by
the origin.
If an origin has negative caching initially enabled but then disabled (either
manually or by disabling caching for a particular response code), cached error
responses are considered valid based only on their Cache-Control or Expires
headers. Therefore, once negative caching is disabled, a response with no
caching age directives in its headers is not served from cache.
Cloud CDN caches in response to GET requests. For more information, see
Cacheable content .
Each cache entry is identified by a cache key .
