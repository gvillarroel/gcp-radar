Change TTL settings and overrides
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to change TTL overrides with Cloud CDN.
TTL overrides give you fine-grained control over how long Cloud CDN
caches your content before revalidating it.
The TTL settings are summarized in the following table.
Default TTL
Max TTL
Client TTL
Reason to configure
Improve cache hit rates for content that doesn't change often
Force Cloud CDN to revalidate content more often than
specified by an origin header
Force clients to revalidate content more
often against Cloud CDN
Used when
One of the following is true, for a successful response:
cache mode = FORCE_CACHE_ALL
cache mode = CACHE_ALL_STATIC , the content-type is
statically cacheable, and a TTL isn't set by origin headers
( max-age , s-maxage , or
Expires )
All of the following are true:
cache mode = CACHE_ALL_STATIC
A TTL is set by origin headers ( max-age ,
s-maxage , or Expires )
The TTL specified in the origin header is greater than the max TTL
value
One of the following is true:
cache mode = FORCE_CACHE_ALL , and the client TTL
value is less than Cloud CDN's TTL
cache mode = CACHE_ALL_STATIC , and the client TTL is
less than the TTL set by the origin header (or default TTL if no
origin header information is present)
Default value
3600 seconds (1 hour)
86,400 seconds (1 day)
3600 seconds (1 hour)
Max allowed value
31,622,400 seconds (1 year)
31,622,400 seconds (1 year)
31,622,400 seconds (1 year)
Notes
Must be less than or equal to the max TTL
--default-ttl=0
forces the response to be revalidated at the origin
Must be less than or equal to the max TTL
Before you begin
Read about cache modes .
Ensure that Cloud CDN is enabled; for instructions, see
Using Cloud CDN .
If necessary, update to the latest version of the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud components update
Note: Make sure that you're using gcloud CLI version 309.0.0 or later.
Set the default TTL
To improve cache hit rates for content that doesn't change often, you can
override the default TTL so that Cloud CDN revalidates content at the
origin less frequently. Note that infrequently accessed objects might be evicted
from the cache before the defined TTL.
When the cache mode is FORCE_CACHE_ALL , the default TTL overwrites the TTL set
in all responses (including those that have a TTL set by origin headers). In
this mode, the default TTL is visible to clients, because Cloud CDN
sets the public and max-age attributes of the responses served to clients.
For CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, the default TTL applies to cached content served
by an origin for responses that don't have an existing valid TTL ( max-age ,
s-maxage , or Expires header). In CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, the default TTL
doesn't modify the Cache-Control header served to clients. To modify the
Cache-Control header in the CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, you must set the client
TTL .
When you set the cache mode to use origin headers ( USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS ), the
default TTL value doesn't apply and cannot be set because Cloud CDN
uses the max-age or s-maxage origin directive or the Expires header
instead.

gcloud
For backend services, use the gcloud compute backend-services
create or
gcloud compute backend-services
update command
with the --default-ttl flag.
For backend buckets, use the gcloud compute backend-buckets
create or
gcloud compute backend-buckets
update command
with the --default-ttl flag.
gcloud compute backend-services (create | update) BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME
--default-ttl= DEFAULT_TTL
gcloud compute backend-buckets (create | update) BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME
--default-ttl= DEFAULT_TTL
Replace DEFAULT_TTL with a value up to 31,622,400 seconds (1
year).
API
For backend buckets, use the
Method: backendBuckets.insert or
Method: backendBuckets.update
API call.
For backend services, use the
Method: backendServices.insert or
Method: backendServices.update
API call.
Use one of the following API calls:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendBuckets
PUT https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendBuckets/ BACKEND_BUCKET
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendServices
PUT https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendServices/ BACKEND_SERVICE
Add the following snippet to the JSON request body:
"cdnPolicy": {
"defaultTtl": DEFAULT_TTL
}
Replace DEFAULT_TTL with a value up to 31,622,400 seconds (1
year).
Set the max TTL
The maximum (max) TTL specifies the maximum allowed TTL within
Cloud CDN for cached content served by an origin.
The TTL of a response is capped by the max TTL if one of the following is true:
The response attempts to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than the max TTL
value.
The response has an Expires header more than cdnPolicy.maxTtl seconds in
the future.
The max TTL setting does not change the max-age value sent to the client; for
more information, see Overriding the maximum client TTL . The max
TTL setting only affects how long Cloud CDN attempts to cache the
content.
This setting is only used when the cache mode is CACHE_ALL_STATIC . The
maximum allowed value is 31,622,400 seconds (1 year). Note that infrequently
accessed objects might be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
With FORCE_CACHE_ALL , the TTL is always set to the default
TTL ; you can't set a max TTL.

Override the client TTL
For all cache modes , Cloud CDN passes
Cache-Control headers to the client.
The client TTL lets you set a maximum TTL for what is sent to browsers or
clients
so that clients revalidate content against Cloud CDN
more often, without requiring revalidation at the origin. This way, content can
be invalidated within
Cloud CDN when necessary, and browsers can discover that the content is
invalidated as soon as the client TTL expires.
In FORCE_CACHE_ALL mode, Cloud CDN normally passes the same max-age
to the client that it uses internally for proxy caching; however, if a client
TTL is specified and is a smaller value, the client TTL is passed to the client
in the max-age directive instead. Similarly, in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, the
client TTL serves as a clamp for whatever max-age is specified by the origin
server so that the max-age sent to the browser or client won't be larger than
the configured client TTL. If no max-age is specified by the origin, the
lesser of Cloud CDN's TTL and the client TTL value is used as the
max-age sent to the browser or client.
If an Expires header is present in the origin response, it is removed and
replaced with a Cache-Control: max-age directive with the appropriate TTL.
For error responses, if no negative caching TTL is set, the Cache-Control
header is also removed.
Because the client TTL is treated as a maximum value for what is sent to
browsers or clients, it can't be used to increase the max-age value that would
otherwise be sent. If the max-age value that is sent to browsers and clients
is lower than you would like, you must increase the max-age directive value in
the response returned by the origin, or adjust the default TTL
or negative caching settings appropriately.
Typically, a client TTL setting of about one day is a good practical upper
bound. A one-day setting means that browsers check in with at least that
frequency and can learn about cache invalidations that might have occurred in
Cloud CDN. You can set the client TTL much higher (up to a year) as a
way of allowing the origin and the configured TTLs to fully control what
is sent to the client. This can be useful if you don't want the browser to
perform more-frequent validations against Cloud CDN.
