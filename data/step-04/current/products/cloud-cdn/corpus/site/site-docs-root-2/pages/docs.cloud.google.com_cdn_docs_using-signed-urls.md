Use signed URLs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides an overview of signed URLs and instructions for using them
with Cloud CDN. Signed URLs give time-limited resource access to anyone in
possession of the URL, regardless of whether the user has a Google Account.
A signed URL is a URL that provides limited permission and time to make a
request. Signed URLs contain authentication information in their query strings,
allowing users without credentials to perform specific actions on a resource.
When you generate a signed URL, you specify a user or service account that must
have sufficient permission to make the request associated with the URL.
After you generate a signed URL, anyone who possesses it can use the signed
URL to perform specified actions (such as reading an object) within a
specified period of time.
Signed URLs also support an optional URLPrefix parameter, allowing you to
provide access to multiple URLs based on a common prefix.
If you want to scope access to a specific URL prefix, consider
using signed cookies .
Note: You cannot configure signed URLs directly in the URL map. You must
configure signed URLs on backend services or backend buckets.
Before you begin
Before you use signed URLs, do the following:
Ensure that Cloud CDN is enabled; for instructions, see
Using Cloud CDN . You can configure
signed URLs on a backend before enabling Cloud CDN, but there is
no effect until Cloud CDN is enabled.
If necessary, update to the latest version of the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud components update
For an overview, see Signed URLs and signed cookies .
Configure signed request keys
Creating keys for your signed URLs or signed cookies requires several steps,
which are described in the following sections.
Security considerations
Important: You must configure your origin web servers to validate the signatures
on every signed request that they serve, and accept or reject unsigned requests.
Cloud CDN does not validate requests in the following circumstances:
The request is not signed.
The backend service or backend bucket for the request doesn't have
Cloud CDN enabled.
Signed requests must always be validated at the origin before serving the
response. This is because origins can be used for serving a mixture of signed
and unsigned content and because a client might access the origin directly.
Cloud CDN doesn't block requests without a Signature query
parameter or Cloud-CDN-Cookie HTTP cookie. It rejects requests with invalid
(or otherwise malformed) request parameters.
When your application detects an invalid signature, make sure that your
application responds with an HTTP 403 (Unauthorized) response code.
HTTP 403 response codes aren't cacheable.
Responses to signed and unsigned requests are cached separately, so a
successful response to a valid signed request is never used to serve an
unsigned request.
If your application sends a cacheable response code to an invalid request,
valid future requests might be incorrectly rejected.
For Cloud Storage backends, make sure to
remove public access ,
so that Cloud Storage can reject requests that are missing a valid
signature.
The following table summarizes the behavior.

Create signed request keys
You enable support for Cloud CDN signed URLs and signed cookies by
creating one or more keys on a Cloud CDN-enabled backend
service , backend
bucket , or both.
For each backend service or backend bucket, you can create and delete keys as
your security needs dictate. Each backend can have up to three keys configured
at a time. We suggest periodically rotating your keys by deleting the oldest,
adding a new key, and using the new key when signing URLs or cookies.
You can use the same key name in multiple backend services and backend buckets
because each set of keys is independent of the others. Key names can be up to
63 characters. To name your keys, use the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
_ (underscore), and - (hyphen).
When you create keys, be sure to keep them secure because anyone who has one of
your keys can create signed URLs or signed cookies that Cloud CDN
accepts until the key is deleted from Cloud CDN. The keys are stored on
the computer where you generate the signed URLs or signed cookies.
Cloud CDN also stores the keys to verify request signatures.
To keep the keys secret, the key values aren't included in responses to any
API requests. If you lose a key, you must create a new one.
Important: Keep the generated key file private, and do not expose it to users or
store it directly in source code. Consider using a secrets storage mechanism
such as Cloud Key Management Service to encrypt the key and provide access to only
trusted applications.
To create a signed request key, follow these steps.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud CDN page.
Go to Cloud CDN
Click the name of the origin that you want to add the key to.
On the Origin details page, click the Edit button.
In the Origin basics section, click Next to open the
Host and path rules section.
In the Host and path rules section, click Next to open the
Cache performance section.
In the Restricted content section, select
Restrict access using signed URLs and signed cookies .
Click Add signing key .
Specify a unique name for the new signing key.
In the Key creation method section, select Automatically generate .
Alternatively, click Let me enter , and then specify a signing key
value.
For the former option, copy the automatically generated signing key
value to a private file, which you can use to
create signed URLs .
Click Done .
In the Cache entry maximum age section, enter a value, and then
select a unit of time.
Click Done .
gcloud
The gcloud command-line tool reads keys from a local file that
you specify. The key file must be created by generating strongly random 128
bits, encoding them with base64, and then replacing the character + with
- and replacing the character / with _ . For more information, see
RFC 4648 .
It is vital that the key is strongly random. On a UNIX-like system, you can
generate a strongly random key and store it in the key file with the
following command:
head -c 16 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr +/ -_ > KEY_FILE_NAME
To add the key to a backend service:
gcloud compute backend-services \
add-signed-url-key BACKEND_NAME \
--key-name KEY_NAME \
--key-file KEY_FILE_NAME
To add the key to a backend bucket:
gcloud compute backend-buckets \
add-signed-url-key BACKEND_NAME \
--key-name KEY_NAME \
--key-file KEY_FILE_NAME
Note: Even though the sub-command is add-signed-url-key , the key is a
signed request key that works for both signed cookies and signed URLs.
Configure Cloud Storage permissions
If you use Cloud Storage and you have restricted who can read the
objects, you must give Cloud CDN permission to read the objects by
adding the Cloud CDN service account to Cloud Storage ACLs.
You don't need to create the service account. The service account is
created automatically the first time that you add a key to a backend
bucket in a project.
Before you run the following command, add at least one key to a backend bucket
in your project. Otherwise, the command fails with an error because the
Cloud CDN cache fill service account is not created until you add one
or more keys for the project.
Note: If you have a domain restricted sharing (DRS) org
policy in
the project, you must disable
it before
running the
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding command .
Make sure to
re-enable
the policy after running the gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding
command.
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// BUCKET \
--member=serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @cloud-cdn-fill.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role=roles/storage.objectViewer
Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with your project number and
BUCKET with your storage bucket.
The Cloud CDN service account
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @cloud-cdn-fill.iam.gserviceaccount.com
doesn't appear in the list of service accounts in your project. This is because
the Cloud CDN service account is owned by Cloud CDN, not your
project.
For more information about project numbers, see
Locate the project ID and project number
in the Google Cloud console Help documentation.
Customize the maximum cache time
Cloud CDN caches responses for signed requests regardless of the
backend's Cache-Control header. The maximum time that responses can be cached
without revalidation is set by the signed-url-cache-max-age flag, which
defaults to one hour and can be modified as shown here.
To set the maximum cache time for a backend service or backend bucket, run one
of the following commands:
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_NAME \
--signed-url-cache-max-age MAX_AGE
gcloud compute backend-buckets update BACKEND_NAME \
--signed-url-cache-max-age MAX_AGE
List signed request key names
To list the keys on a backend service or backend bucket, run one of the
following commands:
gcloud compute backend-services describe BACKEND_NAME
gcloud compute backend-buckets describe BACKEND_NAME
Delete signed request keys
When URLs signed by a particular key should no longer be honored, run one of the
following commands to delete that key from the backend service or backend bucket:
gcloud compute backend-services \
delete-signed-url-key BACKEND_NAME --key-name KEY_NAME
gcloud compute backend-buckets \
delete-signed-url-key BACKEND_NAME --key-name KEY_NAME
Sign URLs
The last step is to sign URLs and distribute them. You can sign URLs by using
the gcloud compute sign-url command or by using code that you write yourself.
If you need many signed URLs, custom code provides better performance.
Note: The host and path components of URLs are used to validate signatures.
When you provide the URL to gcloud or to programmatic APIs, omit the port.
In other words, for a path like https://example.com:443/path , specify the
path as https://example.com/path . Otherwise, the generated signature won't
match the value that Cloud CDN computes.
Create signed URLs
Use these instructions to create signed URLs by using the
gcloud compute sign-url command. This step assumes that you have already
created the keys .
Console
You cannot create signed URLs by using the Google Cloud console. You can
use the Google Cloud CLI or write custom code by using the
following examples.
gcloud
The Google Cloud CLI includes a command for signing URLs. The
command implements the algorithm described in the section about
writing your own code .
gcloud compute sign-url \
" URL " \
--key-name KEY_NAME \
--key-file KEY_FILE_NAME \
--expires-in TIME_UNTIL_EXPIRATION \
[--validate]
This command reads and decodes the base64url encoded
key value from KEY_FILE_NAME , and then outputs a
signed URL that you can use for GET or HEAD requests for the given URL.
For example:
gcloud compute sign-url \
"https://example.com/media/video.mp4" \
--key-name my-test-key \
--expires-in 30m \
--key-file sign-url-key-file
The URL must be a valid URL that has a path
component. For example, http://example.com is invalid, but
https://example.com/ and https://example.com/whatever are both valid
URLs.
If the optional --validate flag is given, this command sends a HEAD
request with the resulting URL, and prints the HTTP response code. If the
signed URL is correct, the response code is the same as the result code sent
by your backend. If the response code isn't the same, recheck
KEY_NAME and the contents of the specified file,
and make sure that the value of
TIME_UNTIL_EXPIRATION is at least several seconds.
If the --validate flag is not given, the following are not verified:
The inputs
The generated URL
The generated signed URL

Generate custom signed URLs
When you write your own code to generate signed URLs, your goal is to create
URLs with the following format or algorithm; all URL parameters are
case-sensitive and must be in the order shown:
https://example.com/foo?Expires= EXPIRATION &KeyName= KEY_NAME &Signature= SIGNATURE
To generate signed URLs, follow these steps:
Ensure that the URL for signing does not have a Signature query
parameter.
Determine when the URL expires and append an Expires query parameter with
the required expiration time in UTC time
(the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). To maximize security,
set the value to the shortest time period possible for your use case. The
longer a signed URL is valid, the bigger the risk that the user that you give
it to shares it with others, accidentally or otherwise.
Set the key name. The URL must be signed with a key of the
backend service or backend bucket that serves the URL. It is best to use
the most recently added key for key rotation. Add the key to the URL by
appending &KeyName= KEY_NAME . Replace
KEY_NAME with the
name of the chosen key created in Creating signed request keys .
Sign the URL. Create the signed URL by following these steps. Make sure that
the query parameters are in the order shown immediately before step 1, and
make sure that nothing in the signed URL changes case.
a. Hash the entire URL (including http:// or https:// at the beginning
and &KeyName... at the end) with HMAC-SHA1 by using the secret
key that corresponds to the key name chosen earlier. Use the raw 16-byte
secret key, not the base64url encoded key. Decode it if needed.
b. Use base64url encode
to encode the result.
c. Append &Signature= to the URL, followed by the encoded signature. Don't convert trailing = characters of the signature to their percent-encoded form, %3D .
Use URL prefixes for signed URLs
Instead of signing the full request URL with the Expires and KeyName query
parameters, you can instead sign the URLPrefix , Expires , and KeyName query
parameters only. This allows a given combination of URLPrefix , Expires ,
KeyName , and Signature query parameters to be reused verbatim across
multiple URLs that match the URLPrefix , avoiding the need to create a new
signature for each distinct URL.
In the following example, the highlighted text shows the
parameters that you sign. The Signature is appended as the final query
parameter, as usual.
https://media.example.com/videos/id/master.m3u8?userID=abc123&starting_profile=1& URLPrefix=aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5leGFtcGxlLmNvbS92aWRlb3Mv&Expires=1566268009&KeyName=mySigningKey&Signature=8NBSdQGzvDftrOIa3WHpp646Iis=
Unlike signing a full request URL, when you sign with URLPrefix you aren't
signing any query parameters, so query parameters can be freely included in the
URL. And, unlike full request URL signatures, those additional query parameters
can appear both before and after the query parameters that make up the
signature. As a result, the following is also a valid URL with a signed URL
prefix:
https://media.example.com/videos/id/master.m3u8?userID=abc123& URLPrefix=aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5leGFtcGxlLmNvbS92aWRlb3Mv&Expires=1566268009&KeyName=mySigningKey&Signature=8NBSdQGzvDftrOIa3WHpp646Iis= &starting_profile=1
URLPrefix denotes a URL-safe base64 encoded URL prefix that encompasses all
paths that the signature should be valid for.
A URLPrefix encodes a scheme (either http:// or https:// ), FQDN, and an
optional path. Ending the path with a / is optional but recommended. The
prefix shouldn't include query parameters or fragments such as ? or # .
For example, https://media.example.com/videos matches requests to both of the
following:
https://media.example.com/videos?video_id=138183&user_id=138138
https://media.example.com/videos/137138595?quality=low
The prefix's path is used as a text substring, not strictly a directory path.
For example, the prefix https://example.com/data grants access to both of the
following:
/data/file1
/database
To avoid this mistake, we recommend ending all prefixes with / unless you
intentionally choose to end the prefix with a partial filename such as
https://media.example.com/videos/123 to grant access to the following:
/videos/123_chunk1
/videos/123_chunk2
/videos/123_chunkN
If the requested URL doesn't match the URLPrefix , Cloud CDN
rejects the request and returns an HTTP 403 error to the client.
Validate signed URLs
The process of validating a signed URL is essentially the same as generating a
signed URL. For example, suppose that you want to validate the following signed
URL:
https://example.com/ PATH ?Expires= EXPIRATION &KeyName= KEY_NAME &Signature= SIGNATURE
You can use the secret key named by KEY_NAME to
independently generate the signature for the following URL:
https://example.com/ PATH ?Expires= EXPIRATION &KeyName= KEY_NAME
Then you can verify that it matches SIGNATURE .
Suppose that you want to validate a signed URL that has a URLPrefix , as shown
here:
https://example.com/ PATH ?URLPrefix= URL_PREFIX &Expires= EXPIRATION &KeyName= KEY_NAME &Signature= SIGNATURE
First, verify that the base64-decoded value of URL_PREFIX
is a prefix of https://example.com/ PATH . If so, you can
then calculate the signature for the following:
URLPrefix= URL_PREFIX &Expires= EXPIRATION &KeyName= KEY_NAME
You can then verify that it matches SIGNATURE .
For URL-based signing methods, where the signature is part of the query
parameters or embedded as a URL path component, the signature and related
parameters are removed from the URL before the request is sent to the
origin. This prevents the signature from causing routing issues when the
origin is handling the request. To validate these requests, you can inspect the
x-client-request-url request header, which includes the original (signed)
client request URL prior to the removal of the signed components.
Remove public access to the Cloud Storage bucket
For signed URLs to properly protect content, it is important that the
origin server not grant public access to that content. When using a
Cloud Storage bucket, a common approach is to make objects public
temporarily for testing purposes. After enabling signed URLs, it's important to
remove the allUsers (and allAuthenticatedUsers , if applicable) READ
permissions (in other words, the Storage Object
Viewer Identity and Access Management role) on the bucket.
After you disable public access on the bucket, individual users can still access
Cloud Storage without signed URLs if they have access permission, such
as OWNER permission.
To remove public allUsers READ access on a Cloud Storage bucket,
reverse the action described in
Making all objects in a bucket publicly readable .
Distribute and use signed URLs
The URL returned from the Google Cloud CLI or produced by your custom
code can be distributed according to your needs. We recommend signing only HTTPS
URLs, because HTTPS provides a secure transport that prevents the Signature
component of the signed URL from being intercepted. Similarly, make sure that
you distribute the signed URLs over secure transport protocols such as
TLS/HTTPS.
