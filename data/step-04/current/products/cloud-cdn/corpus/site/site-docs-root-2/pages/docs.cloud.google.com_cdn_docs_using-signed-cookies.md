Use signed cookies
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides an overview of signed cookies and instructions for using them
with Cloud CDN. Signed cookies give time-limited resource access to a set of
files, regardless of whether the users have Google Accounts.
Signed cookies are an alternative to signed URLs. Signed cookies protect access
when separately signing tens or hundreds of URLs for each user isn't feasible in
your application.
Signed cookies let you do the following:
Authorize a user and provide them with a time-limited token for accessing
your protected content (instead of signing each URL).
Scope the user's access to a specific URL prefix, such as
https://media.example.com/videos/ , and grant the authorized user access to
protected content within that URL prefix only.
Keep your URLs and media manifests unchanged, simplifying your packaging
pipeline and improving cacheability.
If you want to scope access to specific URLs instead, consider using signed
URLs .
Note: You cannot configure signed cookies directly in the URL map. You must
configure signed cookies on backend services or backend buckets.
Before you begin
Before you use signed cookies, do the following:
Ensure that Cloud CDN is enabled; for instructions, see
Using Cloud CDN . You can configure
signed cookies on a backend before enabling Cloud CDN, but there is
no effect until Cloud CDN is enabled.
If necessary, update to the latest version of the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud components update
For an overview, see Signed URLs and signed cookies .
Configuring signed request keys
Creating keys for your signed URLs or signed cookies requires several steps,
which are described in the following sections.
Security considerations
Important: You must configure your origin web servers to validate the signatures
on every signed request that they serve, and accept or reject unsigned requests.
Cloud CDN does not validate requests in the following circumstances:
The request is not signed.
The backend service or backend bucket for the request doesn't have
Cloud CDN enabled.
Signed requests must always be validated at the origin before serving the
response. This is because origins can be used for serving a mixture of signed
and unsigned content and because a client might access the origin directly.
Cloud CDN doesn't block requests without a Signature query
parameter or Cloud-CDN-Cookie HTTP cookie. It rejects requests with invalid
(or otherwise malformed) request parameters.
When your application detects an invalid signature, make sure that your
application responds with an HTTP 403 (Unauthorized) response code.
HTTP 403 response codes aren't cacheable.
Responses to signed and unsigned requests are cached separately, so a
successful response to a valid signed request is never used to serve an
unsigned request.
If your application sends a cacheable response code to an invalid request,
valid future requests might be incorrectly rejected.
For Cloud Storage backends, make sure to
remove public access ,
so that Cloud Storage can reject requests that are missing a valid
signature.
The following table summarizes the behavior.

Create signed request keys
You enable support for Cloud CDN signed URLs and signed cookies by
creating one or more keys on a Cloud CDN-enabled backend
service , backend
bucket , or both.
For each backend service or backend bucket, you can create and delete keys as
your security needs dictate. Each backend can have up to three keys configured
at a time. We suggest periodically rotating your keys by deleting the oldest,
adding a new key, and using the new key when signing URLs or cookies.
You can use the same key name in multiple backend services and backend buckets
because each set of keys is independent of the others. Key names can be up to
63 characters. To name your keys, use the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
_ (underscore), and - (hyphen).
When you create keys, be sure to keep them secure because anyone who has one of
your keys can create signed URLs or signed cookies that Cloud CDN
accepts until the key is deleted from Cloud CDN. The keys are stored on
the computer where you generate the signed URLs or signed cookies.
Cloud CDN also stores the keys to verify request signatures.
To keep the keys secret, the key values aren't included in responses to any
API requests. If you lose a key, you must create a new one.
Important: Keep the generated key file private, and do not expose it to users or
store it directly in source code. Consider using a secrets storage mechanism
such as Cloud Key Management Service to encrypt the key and provide access to only
trusted applications.
To create a signed request key, follow these steps.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud CDN page.
Go to Cloud CDN
Click the name of the origin that you want to add the key to.
On the Origin details page, click the Edit button.
In the Origin basics section, click Next to open the
Host and path rules section.
In the Host and path rules section, click Next to open the
Cache performance section.
In the Restricted content section, select
Restrict access using signed URLs and signed cookies .
Click Add signing key .
Specify a unique name for the new signing key.
In the Key creation method section, select Automatically generate .
Alternatively, click Let me enter , and then specify a signing key
value.
For the former option, copy the automatically generated signing key
value to a private file, which you can use to
create signed URLs .
Click Done .
In the Cache entry maximum age section, enter a value, and then
select a unit of time.
Click Done .
gcloud
The gcloud command-line tool reads keys from a local file that
you specify. The key file must be created by generating strongly random 128
bits, encoding them with base64, and then replacing the character + with
- and replacing the character / with _ . For more information, see
RFC 4648 .
It is vital that the key is strongly random. On a UNIX-like system, you can
generate a strongly random key and store it in the key file with the
following command:
head -c 16 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr +/ -_ > KEY_FILE_NAME
To add the key to a backend service:
gcloud compute backend-services \
add-signed-url-key BACKEND_NAME \
--key-name KEY_NAME \
--key-file KEY_FILE_NAME
To add the key to a backend bucket:
gcloud compute backend-buckets \
add-signed-url-key BACKEND_NAME \
--key-name KEY_NAME \
--key-file KEY_FILE_NAME
Note: Even though the sub-command is add-signed-url-key , the key is a
signed request key that works for both signed cookies and signed URLs.
Configure Cloud Storage permissions
If you use Cloud Storage and you have restricted who can read the
objects, you must give Cloud CDN permission to read the objects by
adding the Cloud CDN service account to Cloud Storage ACLs.
You don't need to create the service account. The service account is
created automatically the first time that you add a key to a backend
bucket in a project.
Before you run the following command, add at least one key to a backend bucket
in your project. Otherwise, the command fails with an error because the
Cloud CDN cache fill service account is not created until you add one
or more keys for the project.
Note: If you have a domain restricted sharing (DRS) org
policy in
the project, you must disable
it before
running the
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding command .
Make sure to
re-enable
the policy after running the gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding
command.
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// BUCKET \
--member=serviceAccount:service- PROJECT_NUMBER @cloud-cdn-fill.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role=roles/storage.objectViewer
Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with your project number and
BUCKET with your storage bucket.
The Cloud CDN service account
service- PROJECT_NUMBER @cloud-cdn-fill.iam.gserviceaccount.com
doesn't appear in the list of service accounts in your project. This is because
the Cloud CDN service account is owned by Cloud CDN, not your
project.
For more information about project numbers, see
Locate the project ID and project number
in the Google Cloud console Help documentation.
Customize the maximum cache time
Cloud CDN caches responses for signed requests regardless of the
backend's Cache-Control header. The maximum time that responses can be cached
without revalidation is set by the signed-url-cache-max-age flag, which
defaults to one hour and can be modified as shown here.
To set the maximum cache time for a backend service or backend bucket, run one
of the following commands:
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_NAME \
--signed-url-cache-max-age MAX_AGE
gcloud compute backend-buckets update BACKEND_NAME \
--signed-url-cache-max-age MAX_AGE
List signed request key names
To list the keys on a backend service or backend bucket, run one of the
following commands:
gcloud compute backend-services describe BACKEND_NAME
gcloud compute backend-buckets describe BACKEND_NAME
Delete signed request keys
When URLs signed by a particular key should no longer be honored, run one of the
following commands to delete that key from the backend service or backend bucket:
gcloud compute backend-services \
delete-signed-url-key BACKEND_NAME --key-name KEY_NAME
gcloud compute backend-buckets \
delete-signed-url-key BACKEND_NAME --key-name KEY_NAME
Creating a policy
Signed cookie policies are a series of key-value pairs (delimited by the :
character), similar to the query parameters used in a signed URL.
For examples, see Issuing cookies to users .
Policies represent the parameters for which a request is valid. Policies are
signed by using a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) that
Cloud CDN validates on each request.
Defining policy format and fields
There are four required fields that you must define in the following order:
URLPrefix
Expires
KeyName
Signature
The key-value pairs in a signed cookie policy are case-sensitive.
URLPrefix
URLPrefix denotes a URL-safe base64 encoded URL prefix that encompasses all
paths that the signature should be valid for.
A URLPrefix encodes a scheme (either http:// or https:// ), FQDN, and an
optional path. Ending the path with a / is optional but recommended. The
prefix shouldn't include query parameters or fragments such as ? or # .
For example, https://media.example.com/videos matches requests to both of the
following:
https://media.example.com/videos?video_id=138183&user_id=138138
https://media.example.com/videos/137138595?quality=low
The prefix's path is used as a text substring, not strictly a directory path.
For example, the prefix https://example.com/data grants access to both of the
following:
/data/file1
/database
To avoid this mistake, we recommend ending all prefixes with / unless you
intentionally choose to end the prefix with a partial filename such as
https://media.example.com/videos/123 to grant access to the following:
/videos/123_chunk1
/videos/123_chunk2
/videos/123_chunkN
If the requested URL doesn't match the URLPrefix , Cloud CDN
rejects the request and returns an HTTP 403 error to the client.
Expires
Expires must be a Unix timestamp (the number of seconds since January 1, 1970).
KeyName
KeyName is the key name for a key created against the backend bucket or
backend service. Key names are case-sensitive.
Signature
Signature is the URL-safe base64 encoded HMAC-SHA-1 signature of the fields
that make up the cookie policy. This is validated on each request; requests
with an invalid signature are rejected with an HTTP 403 error.
Programmatically creating signed cookies
The following code samples demonstrate how to programmatically create signed
cookies.
Note: Consider using Secret Manager for managing access
to your signing keys. Note: The host and path components of the URLPrefix are used to validate
signatures. When you provide the URLPrefix to programmatic APIs, omit the
port. In other words, for a path like https://example.com:443/path/ , specify
the path as https://example.com/path/ . Otherwise, the generated signature will
not match the value that Cloud CDN computes.

Validating signed cookies
The process of validating a signed cookie is essentially the same as generating a
signed cookie. For example, suppose you want to validate the following signed
cookie header:
Cookie: Cloud-CDN-Cookie=URLPrefix= URL_PREFIX :Expires= EXPIRATION :KeyName= KEY_NAME :Signature= SIGNATURE ; Domain=media.example.com; Path=/; Expires=Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:26:49 GMT; HttpOnly
You can use the secret key named by KEY_NAME to
independently generate the signature and then validate that it matches
SIGNATURE .
Issuing cookies to users
Your application must generate and issue each user (client) a single HTTP
cookie containing a correctly signed policy:
Create an HMAC-SHA-1 signer in your application code.
Sign the policy by using the chosen key, taking note of the key name that you
added to the backend, such as mySigningKey .
Create a cookie policy with the following format, noting that both the name
and value are case-sensitive:
Name: Cloud-CDN-Cookie
Value: URLPrefix=$ BASE64URLECNODEDURLORPREFIX :Expires=$ TIMESTAMP :KeyName=$ KEYNAME :Signature=$ BASE64URLENCODEDHMAC
Example Set-Cookie header:
Set-Cookie: Cloud-CDN-Cookie=URLPrefix=aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5leGFtcGxlLmNvbS92aWRlb3Mv:Expires=1566268009:KeyName=mySigningKey:Signature=0W2xlMlQykL2TG59UZnnHzkxoaw=; Domain=media.example.com; Path=/; Expires=Tue, 20 Aug 2019 02:26:49 GMT; HttpOnly
The Domain and Path attributes in the cookie determine whether the client
sends the cookie to Cloud CDN.
Recommendations and requirements
Explicitly set the Domain and Path attributes to match the domain and path
prefix from which you intend to serve your protected content, which might
differ from the domain and path where the cookie is issued ( example.com
versus media.example.com or /browse versus /videos ).
Make sure that you have only one cookie with a given name for the same
Domain and Path .
Ensure that you aren't issuing conflicting cookies because this might prevent
access to content in other browser sessions (windows or tabs).
Set the Secure and HttpOnly flags where applicable. Secure ensures that
the cookie is sent over HTTPS connections only. HttpOnly prevents making the
cookie available to JavaScript.
The cookie attributes Expires and Max-Age are optional. If you omit them,
the cookie exists while the browser session (tab, window) exists.
Note: The Expires attribute mentioned here is the one that (if present)
appears outside of the cookie value. Don't confuse this attribute with the
Expires parameter contained within the cookie value, which is required. The
Expires parameter contained within the cookie value designates the time
limit within which Cloud CDN allows the user to access protected
content. This time limit is independent of the cookie lifespan.
On a cache fill or cache miss, the signed cookie is passed through to the
origin that is defined in the backend service. Ensure that you are validating
the signed cookie value on each request before serving content.
