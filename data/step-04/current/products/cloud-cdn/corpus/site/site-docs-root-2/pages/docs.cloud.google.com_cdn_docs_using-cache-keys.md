Customize cache keys
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to customize Cloud CDN cache keys.
Changing cache key configuration might result in a sudden drop in the cache
hit ratio if new requests start using cache keys that are different from
old cache key entries. Similarly, changing the cache key creator does not
necessarily invalidate cached entries if new requests use the same key as
old cache keys. To invalidate existing cached entries,
see Invalidating cached content .
Caution: Excluding components from cache keys can cause Cloud CDN
to serve content intended for one user to another. Before excluding a component,
ensure that responses from your backend service don't vary based on that
component.
Before you begin
This page assumes an understanding of Cloud CDN ,
Cloud CDN cache keys ,
and load balanced
backend services . We recommend reviewing
these pages before proceeding.
Enable Cloud CDN and customize cache keys
These instructions activate Cloud CDN for a load balanced backend
service and customize the cache key. If you don't already have a load balancer
to use as an origin, see the external Application Load Balancer
documentation for instructions to create one.
Backend buckets don't include the protocol or host in the cache key because
these don't influence how objects are referenced within a Cloud Storage
bucket. However, they include a set of query string parameters that are
specific to Cloud Storage, which might affect the response and might
be extended by a customizable list of parameter names.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud CDN page.
Go to Cloud CDN
Click the name of the origin that you want to update.
Click Edit .
If more than one load balancer is attached to the origin, select the load
balancer that you want to update from the Edit menu.
To expand the Cache performance section, click Next .
For Cache key , select Custom .
In the Cache key components section, by default, all components are
selected. Clear checkboxes for any components that you want to exclude
from the cache key.
Click Done .
gcloud
To exclude one or more components from the cache keys for a backend service,
use the gcloud compute backend-services update command .
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE \
--no-cache-key-include-protocol \
--no-cache-key-include-host \
--no-cache-key-include-query-string
For backend buckets, use the
gcloud compute backend-buckets update command .
API
To exclude one or more components from the cache key, specify configuration
options in the cacheKeyPolicy section of cdnPolicy for the
backendServices resource .
For backend services, use the
backendServices.update method
API call.
PUT https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendServices/ BACKEND_SERVICE
For backend buckets, use the
backendBuckets.update method
API call.
PUT https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendBuckets/ BACKEND_BUCKET
Add the following snippet to the JSON request body:
"cdnPolicy": {
"cacheKeyPolicy": [
{
"includeProtocol": false,
"includeHost": false,
"includeQueryString": false
}
]
}
Update cache keys to add the protocol, host, and query string
By default, backend services configured to use Cloud CDN include
all components of the request URI in cache keys. If you previously indicated
that one or more components should be excluded, you can use the following steps
to include them again.
These instructions add the protocol, host, and query string to the
cache key for an existing backend service that already has Cloud CDN
enabled.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud CDN page.
Go to Cloud CDN
Click the name of the origin that you want to update.
Click Edit .
If more than one load balancer is attached to the origin, select the load
balancer that you want to update from the Edit menu.
To expand the Cache performance section, click Next .
For Cache key , select Custom .
In the Cache key components section, select the
Protocol , Host , and Query string checkboxes.
Click Done .
gcloud
To add one or more components to the cache keys for a backend service,
use the gcloud compute backend-services update command.
Any unspecified flags are left unchanged.
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE \
--cache-key-include-protocol \
--cache-key-include-host \
--cache-key-include-query-string
API
To add one or more components to the cache key, specify configuration
options in the cacheKeyPolicy section of cdnPolicy for the
backendServices resource.
Add the following snippet to the JSON request body:
"cdnPolicy": {
"cacheKeyPolicy": [
{
"includeProtocol": true,
"includeHost": true,
"includeQueryString": true
}
]
}
Update cache keys to use an include or exclude list of query string parameters
These instructions set Cloud CDN cache keys to use an include list
or exclude list with query string parameters.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud CDN page.
Go to Cloud CDN
Click the name of the origin that you want to update.
Click Edit .
If more than one load balancer is attached to the origin, select the load
balancer that you want to update from the Edit menu.
To expand the Cache performance section, click Next .
For Cache key , select Custom .
In the Cache key components section, select the Query string
checkbox. Then, select either of the following options:
If you want to specify query string parameters that must be part of
the cache key, select Include only selected .
If you want to specify that all query string parameters except the
ones that you list are included in the cache key, select
Include all but selected .
Click Add parameter and specify the parameters.
Click Done .
gcloud
To specify an include list or an exclude list for a backend service,
specify query string parameters by using the gcloud compute backend-services
update command.
Use this command to set the query string parameter user to the include
list of a backend service.
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE \
--cache-key-include-query-string \
--cache-key-query-string-whitelist user
Use this command to set the query string parameter user to the exclude
list of a backend service.
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE \
--cache-key-include-query-string \
--cache-key-query-string-blacklist user
Use this command to set the query string parameter user to the include
list of a backend bucket.
gcloud compute backend-buckets update BACKEND_BUCKET \
--cache-key-query-string-whitelist user
API
To specify an include list or an exclude list for a backend service,
specify query string parameters in the cacheKeyPolicy
section of cdnPolicy for the backendServices resource.
To specify an include list, add the following snippet to the JSON request body:
