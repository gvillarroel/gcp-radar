Set up a backend bucket as an origin for Cloud CDN
This quickstart shows you how to set up a backend bucket as an origin for
Cloud CDN by using the Google Cloud console.
To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the
Google Cloud console, click Guide me :

Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
If you're using an existing project for this guide,
verify that you have
the permissions required to complete this guide . If you created a new
project, then you already have the required permissions.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .

Compute Load Balancer Admin ( roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .

Refresh the page multiple times.
Return to the Load balancer details page, and then click Monitoring .
After a few minutes, observe the served traffic.
Traffic that is served directly from your backend bucket is labeled
SERVED_FROM_BACKEND_BUCKET . Traffic that is served from
Cloud CDN is labeled SERVED_FROM_CACHE . For more information,
see Monitoring metrics .
Clean up
