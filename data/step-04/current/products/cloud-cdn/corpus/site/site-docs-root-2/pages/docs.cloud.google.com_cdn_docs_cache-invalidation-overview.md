Cache invalidation overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides an overview of Cloud CDN cache invalidation.
What is cache invalidation?
After an object is cached, it normally remains in the cache until it expires or
is evicted to make room for new content. You might want to remove an object
from the cache before its normal expiration time. You can force an object
or set of objects to be ignored by the cache by requesting a cache invalidation.
Cache invalidation, sometimes called cache purging , is the process of
declaring cached content to be invalid. This process causes the entry to be
removed from the cache and then refilled from the backend server the next time
that the content is requested.
Cloud CDN supports the use of cache tags and invalidation matchers, such as
host and URL path, for invalidation requests.
You can combine these invalidation parameters to target specific cached
responses and minimize backend load on the subsequent cache fill.
It's important to ensure that the backend server is returning the correct
content before you request the cache invalidation. Otherwise, when
Cloud CDN requests the content again, it might cache the incorrect
content.
Invalidations requests are rate limited. You can submit up to 500 invalidation
requests per minute. Each invalidation request takes effect in about 10 seconds.
Cloud CDN doesn't restrict the number of objects or the total size of
all invalidated objects for each request.
Invalidation by URLs
Each invalidation request specifies a path pattern that identifies the object
or set of objects that should be invalidated. The path pattern can be either a
specific path, such as /cat.jpg , or a path prefix, such as /picture* .
The following rules apply to path patterns:
The path pattern must start with / .
It cannot include ? or # .
It must not include an * except as the final character.
If a path ends with * , all objects whose paths begin with the string
that precedes * are invalidated. For example, for the
invalidation path /picture* , the prefix is /picture . Any object path
beginning with /picture is invalidated, including /picture/cat.jpg ,
/pictures/dog.jpg , and /picture1.jpg .
If you want to invalidate all objects
in a directory, include the trailing / in the path pattern, for example,
/pictures/* .
The path pattern is compared with the path component of the URL, which is
everything between the hostname and any ? or # that might be present.
If you have URLs that contain a query string, for example
/images.php?image=fred.png , you cannot selectively invalidate objects that
differ only by query string. For example, if you have two images,
/images.php?image=fred.png and /images.php?image=barney.png , you cannot
invalidate only fred.png . To invalidate all images served by images.php, use
/images.php as the path pattern.
Invalidation for a single host
Cache invalidation invalidates the path for all your hostnames. For
example, if you have example.com and example2.com pointed to the same
load balancer, and you invalidate /images/cat.jpg , both
example.com/images/cat.jpg and example2.com/images/cat.jpg are invalidated.
You can restrict the invalidation to only one of the hosts by specifying the
host.
Invalidation by cache tags
Cache tags (or surrogate keys ) let you invalidate content based on
arbitrary metadata.
Note: Cache tags are different from cache keys .
These tags are defined with the Cache-Tag HTTP header in a backend
response. Cache tags from the backend in the Cache-Tag HTTP response
header are sent to the client.
Cache tags have the following limits:
Must not exceed 120 bytes per tag
Must not exceed 4 KiBs (4096 bytes) of total tag names per cached object
Must not exceed 50 tags per object
If these tag limits are exceeded, the response isn't cached and this
decision is logged as RESPONSE_CACHE_TAG_INVALID in
LoadBalancerLogEntry.cacheDecision .
You can specify up to 10 cache tags per invalidation request. When multiple tags
are specified in a single invalidation request, they are treated as a logical
OR . Consider an example in which you have the following cached
objects:
Cached object #1 with tags js , 2020-12-23 , and
prod
Cached object #2 with tags css , 2020-11-30 , and
prod
Cached object #3 with tags img 2020-11-30 , and
staging
When you issue a request to invalidate objects that match
tags="prod,2020-11-30" , all three cached objects are invalidated.
This approach means that you don't need to know or specify all possible tag
combinations when you want to invalidate an object.
If you specify invalidation matchers along with cache tags, the
invalidation request applies only to the tagged objects that match the
invalidation matchers. Consider an example with the following cached objects:
Cached object #1 with URL https://staging.example.com/img/cat.jpg and tag a
Cached object #2 with URL https://example.com/img/cat.jpg and tag a
Cached object #3 with URL https://staging.example.com/js/cat.js and tag a
Cached object #4 with URL https://staging.example.com/img/logo.jpg and tag b
When you issue a request to invalidate objects where the host is
staging.example.com , the path /img/* , and the tag a , only object #1 is
invalidated. Objects #2, #3, and #4 don't match the host, path, or tag,
respectively.
Invalidation latency
Because Cloud CDN is a distributed system, it might report that
an invalidation has completed even though a small number of caches have not
yet processed the invalidation request. This situation is rare and
corrects itself automatically.
Best practices
Invalidate only what you must because invalidating too much might cause a
spike in requests that the caches were serving to suddenly hit
your instances or buckets.
Invalidation is intended for use in exceptional circumstances, not as part of
your normal workflow. Invalidations don't affect cached copies in
web browser caches or caches operated by third-party internet service providers.
As an alternative to routine invalidations, you can proactively set appropriate
expiration times on responses or use different URLs for different versions
of your content. For more information about expiration times, see
Expiration times and validation requests .
Invalidation with Shared VPC cross-project service referencing
Cache invalidation is configured in the frontend project; that is, the project
that has the forwarding rule, target proxy, and URL map of the load balancer.
So, when you're using a global external Application Load Balancer with Shared VPC
cross-project service referencing ,
by default, service project administrators don't have the required permissions
to request cache invalidations.
Cache invalidations can be issued only by principals who have the
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for configuring load balancer resources in the
frontend projects—for example, the Compute Network Admin role
( roles/compute.networkAdmin ).
Service administrators, who control provisioning of the backend services in a
separate project, can work with the load balancer administrator of the
frontend project to issue cache invalidation for their cross-project services.
For URL rewrites, ensure that the invalidation matches the pre-rewrite host and
path that the client sends.
