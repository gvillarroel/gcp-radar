Serve stale content
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides information about serving stale, expired content with
Cloud CDN. Serving stale content lets Google's global cache continue to serve
content when your origin server is unreachable or is returning errors to
Cloud CDN.
The reasons to do this are as follows:
You prefer to serve stale content to users rather than returning errors to
users.
Serving stale content avoids latency when the cache gets a request for content
that has just expired. Rather than having to wait for a synchronous
revalidation to the backend, the cache serves the stale content that has just
expired, while triggering a separate revalidation.
Cloud CDN offers the following two methods to control how long a
stale object can be served while a revalidation request is sent to the
origin:
At the origin: You can specify the Cache-Control: stale-while-revalidate
directive in the response header. Cloud CDN honors this directive,
serving the stale content for the specified number of seconds past the cache
entry expiration time. During this period, Cloud CDN asynchronously
sends a request to the origin to revalidate and refresh the content.
Note: Cache-Control: stale-while-revalidate directive is not honored in
FORCE_CACHE_ALL mode. FORCE_CACHE_ALL caches all content and ignores any stale-while-revalidate directive from the origin.
Through the policy: This is a Cloud CDN configuration setting that
dictates a maximum duration, after the response has expired, for which
Cloud CDN can continue serving a stale version. This is configured
using the serve-while-stale option. If the
stale-while-revalidate directive isn't present in the response, this setting
is used. If a value isn't specified, the default value, 86400s (1 day), is
used.
Cloud CDN doesn't support the stale-if-error directive. This
directive instructs the cache to avoid serving stale content unless synchronous
revalidation with the origin server has failed with particular error status codes.
The default, minimum, and maximum values are as follows:
Default: 86,400 seconds (one day)
Minimum: 0 seconds (disables the feature)
Maximum: 604,800 seconds (one week)
Stale content is served up to the specified limit past the cache entry
expiration time, which is defined by the max-age , s-maxage , or Expires
headers. For more information, see Expiration times and validation
requests .
If a Cloud CDN edge cache does not have a cached copy of the object to
serve stale, or the object has reached the maximum stale TTL, Cloud CDN
synchronously revalidates the content with the origin. If the origin returns
an error at that time, Cloud CDN returns the origin error.
Logging and User Agent
The asynchronous requests made by Cloud CDN appear to your origin
server exactly like the normal revalidation requests that occur when not serving
stale content. The exception is that they are tagged with a User-Agent header
containing Cloud-CDN-Google .
Asynchronous requests are also separately logged to Cloud Logging, so a user
request that is served stale generates two log entries: the first for the
content actually served to the user, and the second for the revalidation request
to the origin. Like synchronous revalidations, Cloud CDN may send a
conditional request in some circumstances,
or just re-request the content unconditionally. In either case, the response
code logged to Cloud Logging corresponds to the original request to
Cloud CDN; for example, a 200 OK for an unconditional request, or a
304 Not Modified if the user's original response was conditional.
Client max-stale request directive
Clients can request a shorter stale service time by specifying a max-stale
cache-control directive. If specified, this directive controls the amount of
staleness the client tolerates.
If the cached content is more stale than the client's max-stale value,
Cloud CDN revalidates the content before serving.
The client cannot request a max-stale value greater than the value
configured with the serve-while-stale configuration option and the
stale-while-revalidate cache-control directive from the origin.
Before you begin
Read about cache modes and static content .
Ensure that Cloud CDN is enabled; for instructions, see
Using Cloud CDN .
If necessary, update to the latest version of the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud components update
Note: Make sure that you're using gcloud CLI version 322.0.0 or later.
