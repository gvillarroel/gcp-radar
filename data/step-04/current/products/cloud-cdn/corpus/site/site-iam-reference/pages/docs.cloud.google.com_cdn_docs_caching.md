Caching overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A cacheable response is an HTTP response that Cloud CDN can store and quickly
retrieve, thus allowing for faster load times. Not all HTTP responses are
cacheable.
Cache modes
With cache modes, you can control the factors that determine whether
Cloud CDN caches your content.
Cloud CDN offers three cache modes, which define how responses
are cached, whether Cloud CDN respects cache directives sent by the
origin, and how cache TTLs are applied.
The available cache modes are shown in the following table:
Cache mode
Behavior
CACHE_ALL_STATIC
Automatically caches successful responses with
static content that isn't otherwise
non-cacheable .
Origin responses that set valid caching directives are also cached.
This behavior is the default for Cloud CDN-enabled
backends created by using the Google Cloud CLI or the REST API.
USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS
Requires successful origin responses to set valid cache directives and valid
caching headers . Successful responses without these directives
are forwarded from the origin.
FORCE_CACHE_ALL
Unconditionally caches successful responses, overriding any cache
directives set by the origin. This mode is not appropriate if the backend
serves private, per-user (user identifiable) content, such as dynamic
HTML or API responses.
Error responses may be cached even
in the absence of valid cache directives.
Before you set the cache mode to FORCE_CACHE_ALL , consider the following
behaviors:
For signed URLs or signed cookies ,
FORCE_CACHE_ALL overrides the maximum age specified through the Cache
entry maximum age setting in the Google Cloud console or the gcloud
--signed-url-cache-max-age option.
FORCE_CACHE_ALL changes the time to live (TTL) of any previously cached
content. This change can cause some entries that were previously considered
fresh (due to having longer TTLs from origin headers) to be considered stale,
and it can cause some entries that were previously considered stale to be
considered fresh.
FORCE_CACHE_ALL overrides cache directives ( Cache-Control and Expires )
but does not override other origin response headers. In particular, a Vary
header might suppress caching even if the cache mode is FORCE_CACHE_ALL . For
more information, see Vary headers .
For setup instructions, see Setting the cache mode .
Static content
Static content is content that is always the same, even when accessed by
different users. The CSS that you use to style your site, JavaScript to provide
interactivity, video, and image content typically don't change for each user for
a given URL ( cache key ), and thus benefit from being cached across
Cloud CDN's global edge network.
When you set the cache mode to CACHE_ALL_STATIC , and a response
does not have explicit caching directives in Cache-Control or Expires
headers, Cloud CDN automatically caches that response for the
following:
Web Assets, including CSS ( text/css ), JavaScript
( application/javascript ) and all web fonts, including WOFF2 ( font/woff2 )
Images, including JPEG ( image/jpg ) and PNG ( image/png )
Videos, including H.264, H.265, and MP4 ( video/mp4 )
Audio files, including MP3 ( audio/mpeg ) and MP4 ( audio/mp4 )
Formatted documents, including PDF ( application/pdf )
Important: The static content rules described here apply only to successful
responses (for example, HTTP 200 OK responses). By contrast, error responses
are cached based on the negative caching
settings, regardless of content type.
The following table provides a summary.
Category
MIME types
Web assets
text/css text/ecmascript text/javascript application/javascript
Fonts
Any Content-Type matching font/*
Images
Any Content-Type matching image/*
Videos
Any Content-Type matching video/*
Audio
Any Content-Type matching audio/*
Formatted document types
application/pdf and application/postscript
Cloud CDN inspects the Content-Type HTTP response header, which
reflects the MIME
type
of the content being served.
Note the following:
Your origin's web server software must set the Content-Type for each
response. Many web servers automatically set the Content-Type header,
including NGINX, Varnish, and Apache.
Cloud Storage sets the Content-Type header automatically
when you use the Google Cloud console or the Google Cloud CLI to upload content.
Cloud Storage always provides a Cache-Control header to
Cloud CDN. If no value is explicitly chosen, it sends a default value.
As a result, all successful Cloud Storage responses are cached
according to Cloud Storage default values, unless you explicitly
adjust the cache control metadata for
objects in Cloud Storage or use FORCE_CACHE_ALL mode to override
the values sent by Cloud Storage.
If you want to cache text/html and application/json content types, you
must set explicit Cache-Control headers in the response ,
being careful not to accidentally cache one user's data and serve it to all
users.
If a response is cacheable based on its MIME type but has a Cache-Control
response header of private or no-store , or a Set-Cookie
header, it isn't cached. To learn more, see cacheability rules .
Other content types, such as HTML ( text/html ) and JSON
( application/json ), are not cached by default for successful responses. These
types of responses are typically dynamic (per user). Examples include shopping
carts, product pages with user personalization, and authenticated API
responses. Negative caching , if enabled, can
still cause them to be cached for certain status codes, however.
Cloud CDN doesn't use file extensions in the URL path to determine
whether a response is cacheable because many valid cacheable responses aren't
reflected in URLs.
Cache policy configuration methods
Depending on how much control you need over caching behavior, you can configure
caching behavior for Cloud CDN at the backend service, backend bucket,
or at a more granular level in URL maps.
Backend service or backend bucket cache policy
Configure a cache policy on a backend service or backend bucket to apply
a single caching policy to all requests that are routed to that backend.
Cache policies in URL maps
Preview
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
You can configure Cloud CDN cache policies at various levels of the URL
map. This provides granular control over caching policies based on criteria like
hostname, URL path, HTTP headers, and query parameters for specific routes.
Note: Setting cache policies at various levels of the URL map is supported only for
the global external Application Load Balancer, and not for the classic Application Load Balancer.
Setting cache policies at different levels of the URL map, such as root, path matchers,
path rules, and route rules, gives you granular control over
caching different types of content served by the same backend.
For example, you can configure path rules to:
Cache static images in the /images/* path for 24 hours.
Cache HTML pages in the /pages/* path for 5 minutes.
You can configure cache policies in URL maps when:
a single backend serves different types of content
different paths require different caching behavior
you want to enable caching for specific routes only
For details on how to configure cache policies in URL map, see
Configure a Cloud CDN cache policy .
Note: Some Cloud CDN features are configured only on the backend.
For example, Dynamic compression ,
Signed URLs
and Signed cookies are managed on
the backend.
Cacheable content
Cloud CDN caches responses that meet all of the requirements in
this section. Some of these requirements are specified by RFC
7234 , and others are
specific to Cloud CDN.
Cloud CDN may periodically change the exact set of conditions under
which it caches content. If you want to explicitly prevent Cloud CDN
from caching your content, follow the guidelines in RFC 7234 to
determine how to specify a guaranteed-uncacheable response. See also the
non-cacheable content based on origin headers section.
Cloud CDN stores responses in cache if all of the following are true.
Attribute
Requirement
Served by
Backend service, backend bucket, or an external backend with
Cloud CDN enabled
In response to
GET request
Status code
200 , 203 , 204 , 206 ,
300 , 301 , 302 , 307 ,
308 , 404 , 405 , 410 ,
421 , 451 , or 501 .
Freshness
The response
has a Cache-Control header with a max-age or
s-maxage directive, or an Expires header with a
timestamp in the future.
For cacheable responses without an age (for example, with
no-cache ), the public directive must be explicitly
provided.
With the CACHE_ALL_STATIC cache mode, if no freshness
directives are present, a successful response with static content type
is still eligible for caching.
With the FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode, any successful response
is eligible for caching. This might result in caching of private, per-user
content. You should only set
FORCE_CACHE_ALL on backends that aren't serving private or
dynamic content, such as Cloud Storage buckets.
If negative caching is
enabled and the status code matches one for which negative caching specifies
a TTL, the response is eligible for caching, even without explicit freshness
directives.
Content
For HTTP/1 origins, the response must contain a valid
Content-Length , Content-Range , or
Transfer-Encoding: chunked header.
For origins that use more advanced HTTP protocol versions (HTTP/2 and
later), the response need not have such headers.
Size
Less than or equal to the maximum size .
For responses with sizes between 10 MiB and 100 GiB, see the
additional cacheability constraints described in
byte range requests .
For Cloud Storage backend buckets, follow these additional suggestions:
Make your bucket publicly readable .
This is the approach that we recommend for public content. With this
setting, anyone on the internet can view and list your objects and their
metadata, excluding ACLs. The recommended practice is to dedicate specific
buckets for public objects.
Use managed folders to
make a portion of your bucket publicly readable .
Make individual objects publicly readable .
We don't recommend this approach, because it uses a legacy,
Cloud Storage-specific permissioning system.
Don't store the object in a bucket that has Requester Pays enabled
or resides within a Virtual Private Cloud service perimeter .
Don't encrypt the object by using customer-managed encryption keys or
customer-supplied encryption keys .
By default, when an object is public and doesn't specify Cache-Control
metadata, Cloud Storage assigns a Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
header to the object. You can set different values by using
Cache-Control metadata .
For an example that shows how to configure an external Application Load Balancer with a backend
bucket, see Setting up Cloud CDN with a backend
bucket .
Note: If you want to keep your content private, use
private origin authentication
or signed URLs .
Maximum size
Cloud CDN enforces a maximum size for each response. Any response with
a body larger than the maximum size is not cached but is still delivered to the
client.
The maximum size varies depending on whether the origin server supports byte
range requests .
Origin server supports byte range requests
Origin server does not support byte range requests
100 GiB (107,374,182,400 bytes)
10 MiB (10,485,760 bytes)
Nearly all modern web servers (including NGINX, Apache, and Varnish) support
byte range requests.
Non-cacheable content based on origin headers
There are checks that block caching of responses. Cloud CDN may
periodically change the exact set of conditions under which it caches content,
so if you want to explicitly prevent Cloud CDN
from caching your content, follow the guidelines in the standard ( RFC
7234 ) to determine how to specify a
guaranteed-uncacheable response.
Cloud CDN doesn't cache a response if it does not meet the requirements
for Cacheable content , or if any of the following is true.
Attribute
Requirement
Served by
Backend service or external backend that doesn't have
Cloud CDN enabled
Cookie
Has a Set-Cookie header
Vary header
Has a value other than Accept ,
Accept-Encoding ,
Access-Control-Request-Headers ,
Access-Control-Request-Method , Origin ,
Sec-Fetch-Dest , Sec-Fetch-Mode ,
Sec-Fetch-Site , X-Goog-Allowed-Resources ,
X-Origin , or one of the headers that are configured to be
part of the cache key settings .
Response directive
Response has a Cache-Control header with the
no-store or private
directive (unless using the FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode, in
which case the Cache-Control header is ignored)
Request directive
Request has a Cache-Control: no-store directive
Request authorization
Request has an Authorization header, unless
overridden by the response
Cache-Control.
Size
Larger than the maximum size
If Cache-Control: no-store or private is present, but the
content is still being cached, this is due to one of the following:
URL signing is configured.
The Cloud CDN cache mode is set to force caching of all responses.
Prevent caching
To prevent private information from being cached in Cloud CDN
caches, do the following:
Make sure that Cloud CDN cache mode isn't set to the
FORCE_CACHE_ALL mode, which unconditionally caches all successful
responses.
Include a Cache-Control: private header in responses that shouldn't be
stored in Cloud CDN caches, or a Cache-Control: no-store
header in responses that shouldn't be stored in any cache, even a web
browser's cache.
Don't sign URLs that provide access to private
information. When content is accessed by using a signed URL, it is potentially
eligible for caching regardless of any Cache-Control directives in the
response.
For origin (cache fill) requests that include the Authorization request
header, Cloud CDN only caches responses that include the public ,
must-revalidate , or s-maxage cache control directives when the cache mode
is set to USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS or CACHE_ALL_STATIC . This prevents
accidentally caching per-user content and content that requires
authentication. The FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode does not have this
restriction.
Custom response headers
With custom response headers ,
you can specify headers that the classic Application Load Balancer adds to proxied
responses. Custom response headers let you reflect the cache status to your
clients, client geographic data, and your own static response headers.
For instructions, see Configure custom response headers .
Cache keys
Each cache entry in a Cloud CDN cache is identified by a cache
key . When a request comes into the cache, the cache converts the URI of the
request into a cache key, and then compares it with keys of cached entries.
If it finds a match, the cache returns the object associated with that key.
For backend services, Cloud CDN defaults to using the complete request URI as the cache key.
For example, https://example.com/images/cat.jpg is the complete URI for a
particular request for the cat.jpg object. This string is used as the default
cache key. Only requests with this exact string match. Requests for
http://example.com/images/cat.jpg or
https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user1 don't match.
For backend buckets, the default is for the cache key to consist of the URI
without the protocol or host. By default, only query parameters that are known
to Cloud Storage are included as part of the cache key (for example,
"generation").
Thus, for a given backend bucket, the following URIs resolve to the same cached
object:
http://example.com/images/cat.jpg
https://example.com/images/cat.jpg
https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user1
http://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user1
https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user2
https://media.example.com/images/cat.jpg
https://www.example.com/images/cat.jpg
You can change which parts of the URI are used in the cache key. While the
filename and path must always be part of the key, you can include or omit any
combination of protocol, host, or query string when customizing your cache key.
Using cache keys describes how to customize your
cache keys.
URI part
Customization
Example URLs that have the same cache key
Protocol
Omit the protocol from the cache key.
https://example.com/images/cat.jpg
http://example.com/images/cat.jpg
Host
Omit the host from the cache key.
https://example.com/images/cat.jpg
https://example2.com/images/cat.jpg
Query string
Omit the query string from the cache key.
Selectively omit or include portions of the query string.
https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user1
https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user2
In addition to including or omitting the entire query string, you can use
portions of the query string by using include lists and exclude lists.
Query string include list
You can selectively control which query string parameters Cloud CDN
incorporates into cache keys. For example, if you create an include list of
user , then https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user1&color=blue
creates a cache key of https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user1 that
also matches https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user1&color=red .
To use this option, you must include the query string, specify a
non-empty include list, and not specify an exclude list.
Query string include list for Cloud Storage cache keys
Note: Make sure that you're using gcloud CLI version 369.0.0 or later.
Including URL query parameters in cache keys for Cloud Storage buckets
helps support cache busting . Cache busting lets a user retrieve a new version
of the file that has been uploaded, even if the earlier version is still validly
cached based on the TTL setting.
You can use an include list with query string parameters in the cache key used for
serving responses from a backend bucket. Although Cloud Storage does
not serve different content or route based on query parameters, you can choose
to include parameters that allow you to cache-bust static content stored in
Cloud Storage buckets.
For example, you can append a ?version=VERSION or ?hash=HASH query parameter
that is based on the underlying content. This limits the need to proactively
invalidate content and aligns with modern web development workflows, where web
frameworks and URLs use a hash of the content to avoid serving stale objects
across deployments.
Because including query parameters in the cache key is opt-in only,
Cloud CDN doesn't support excluding query parameters from a cache key
to a backend bucket.
Query string exclude list
You can selectively control which query string parameters Cloud CDN
ignores by using an exclude list. For example, if you create an exclude list of
user , all query string parameters except user are used in the cache key.
With the exclude list configured and an input of
https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user1&color=blue , Cloud CDN
creates a cache key of https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?color=blue that also
matches https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user2&color=blue but not
https://example.com/images/cat.jpg?user=user1&color=red .
To use this option, you must include the query string, specify a non-empty
exclude list, and not specify an include list.
Query parameter order
The generated cache key doesn't depend on the order of the query parameters.
For example, the following query parameters generate the same cache key:
info=123&variant=13e&geography=US
geography=US&variant=13e&info=123
HTTP headers and HTTP cookies settings
Note: Make sure that you're using gcloud CLI version 369.0.0 or later.
You can improve cache hit rates and origin offload with the following cache key
configuration settings:
For backend services and buckets: Use HTTP headers as part of cache
keys by including named headers in the cache key configuration.
For backend services only: Use named HTTP cookies as cache keys, such as
for A/B (multivariate) testing, canarying, and similar scenarios.
Note: Increasing the number of unique cache keys can reduce the cache hit rate,
especially if there is a large number of possible values.
Cache requests that include additional HTTP headers or HTTP cookies in the
request are cached on the third request in a cache location for that cache key.
This reduces the impact of high-cardinality header or cookie values on your
cache eviction rates. Under normal circumstances and user traffic conditions,
this shouldn't be noticeable and helps ensure that popular content remains
cached.
Include request headers
To cache additional variations of a response, you can include additional request
headers in the cache key.
Some headers are not allowed in cache keys because they are
typically very high cardinality. In most cases, the values of these headers are
either unique per user ( Cookie , Authorization ) or have thousands of likely
values ( Referer , User-Agent , Accept ). For example, the User-Agent header
can have over 5,000 unique values given the large variety of browsers,
user-devices, and operating systems. These types of headers would have a
severe negative impact on cache hit rates.
Only valid HTTP header field names are accepted per
RFC 7230 .
Header field names are case-insensitive, and duplicates are rejected.
You may optionally configure your origin server to include configured cache-key
request headers in the Vary response. It is not required for
Cloud CDN, but can be helpful for downstream caches. For more
information, see Vary headers .
Cloud CDN doesn't allow the following headers to be included in the
list of headers:
Accept
Accept-Encoding
Authority , because this is controlled by configuration ( cdnPolicy.includeHost )
Authorization , typically per-user as in OAuth Bearer tokens
CDN-Loop
Connection
Content-MD5
Content-Type
Cookie
Date
Forwarded , often per-client or per-proxy
From
Host , because this is controlled by configuration ( cdnPolicy.includeHost )
If-Match , If-Modified-Since , or If-None-Match
Origin
Proxy-Authorization
Range
Referer (or Referrer )
User-Agent
Want-Digest
X-CSRFToken and X-CSRF-Token as used by Django and Ruby on Rails
X-Forwarded-For , often per-client or per-proxy
X-User-IP
Any header starting with the following:
Access-Control- , such as
Access-Control-Request-Headers and Access-Control-Request-Method
Sec-Fetch-
Sec-GFE-
Sec-Google-
X-Amz-
X-GFE-
X-Goog-
X-Google-
Use custom variables with request headers
Cache keys are helpful when you need to serve content differently based
on each user's device and location. For example, you can enable a responsive
website to serve the appropriate images for users that are viewing content
based on their device type or set a helpful default language based on their location.
You can define cache keys by using custom request headers and custom variables.
To use custom variables with request headers, do the following:
Define a custom request header
for your backend service. Include one or more variables for the custom
request header value.
Update the cache key
to use the custom request header.
For Cloud CDN, you can use only the following variables when defining
headers that are both custom request headers and cache key headers:
device_request_type
user_agent_family
client_region
client_region_subdivision
Cloud CDN limits the variables to help maintain cache performance.
This is similar to limits on the headers that can be used as cache keys .
For example, if you could specify X-Lat-Long:{client_city_lat_long} as a
custom request header and then add X-Lat-Long to your set of cache key
headers, Cloud CDN would attempt to cache one copy of the response for
each value of client_city_lat_long . This would ultimately lead to cache
overuse, unnecessary content flushing, and reduced opportunity to return cache
hits.
For these reasons, variables that have high cardinality aren't included in the
list of variables that are used to define custom request headers and
subsequently cache keys.
Same headers with different values
Suppose the user sends multiple same-named headers with different header
values—for example:
My-Header: Value1
My-Header: Value2
In this case, Cloud CDN modifies the request by assuming that the
header must follow the standard convention that allows some headers to have
multiple values. Cloud CDN collapses them into a comma-separated list
to send to the backend, so it's as if the client sent the following:
My-Header: Value1, Value2
Include named cookies
Note: Make sure that you're using gcloud CLI version 369.0.0 or later.
An HTTP cookie is a name=value pairing, and a request can include
multiple HTTP cookies, either separated by a semicolon on the same line, or
as discrete Cookie request headers with one cookie per header.
You can provide a list of up to five cookie names.
User agents (such as web browsers) often limit the number of cookies
stored per domain to 4 KB; make sure not to send too many
(or too large) cookies, as the user agent might not send all cookies in a
request. This can impact whether a user receives a specific cached response.
If you are serving your static content from a different hostname from which you
issue cookies, ensure that the Domain attribute of the cookie
(and the Path ) attribute allows the cookie to be sent along with requests
for static content.
If a request includes multiple instances of the same cookie name, only the first
one is honored.
Cache control directives
HTTP cache control directives affect Cloud CDN's behavior, as outlined
in the following table.
N/A signifies that a directive is not applicable to a request or response.
Directive
Request
Response
no-store
When present in a request, Cloud CDN honors this and
does not store the response in the cache.
A response with no-store isn't cached.
This can be overridden on a per-backend basis with the
FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode.
no-cache
The no-cache request directive is ignored to prevent clients from
potentially initiating or forcing revalidation to the origin.
A response with no-cache is cached but must be
revalidated with the origin before being served.
This can be overridden on a per-backend basis with the
FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode.
public
N/A
This directive is not required for cacheability, but it is a best
practice to include it for content that should be cached by proxies.
private
N/A
A response with the private directive isn't cached by
Cloud CDN, even if the response is otherwise considered
cacheable. Clients (such as browsers) might still cache the result.
This can be overridden on a per-backend basis with the
FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode.
Use no-store to prevent all caching of responses.
max-age= SECONDS
The max-age request directive is ignored. A cached response is
returned as if this header was not included in the request.
A response with the max-age directive is cached up to the defined
SECONDS .
s-maxage= SECONDS
N/A
A response with the s-maxage directive is cached up to
the defined SECONDS .
If both max-age and s-maxage are present,
s‑maxage is used by Cloud CDN.
Responses with this directive aren't served stale.
s-max-age (two hyphens) is not valid for the purposes of
caching.
min-fresh= SECONDS
The min-fresh request directive is ignored. A cached response is
returned as if this header was not included in the request.
N/A
max-stale= SECONDS
The max-stale request directive dictates the maximum
staleness (in seconds) that the client is willing to accept.
Cloud CDN honors this, and returns a stale cached
response only if the staleness of the response is less than the
max-stale directive. Otherwise, it revalidates before serving
the request.
N/A
stale-while-revalidate= SECONDS
N/A
A response with stale-while-revalidate is served to a
client for up to SECONDS
while revalidation takes place asynchronously.
This behavior can be enabled for all responses by setting
cdnPolicy.serveWhileStale on the backend.
stale-if-error= SECONDS
The stale-if-error request directive is ignored. A cached
response is returned as if this header was not included in the request.
This response header has no effect.
must-revalidate
N/A
A response with must-revalidate is revalidated with the
origin server after it expires.
Responses with this directive aren't served stale.
proxy-revalidate
A response with proxy-revalidate is revalidated with the origin
server after it expires.
Responses with this directive aren't served stale.
immutable
N/A
No effect. This is passed on to the client in the response.
no-transform
N/A
No transforms are applied by Cloud CDN.
only-if-cached
The only-if-cached request directive is ignored. A cached
response is returned as if this header was not included in the request.
N/A
Where possible, Cloud CDN endeavors to be RFC-compliant (HTTP RFC
7234), but favors optimizing for cache offload and minimizing the impact that
clients can have on hit rate and overall origin load.
For responses that use the HTTP/1.1 Expires header:
The value of the Expires header must be a valid HTTP-date as
defined in RFC 7231 .
A date value in the past, an invalid date, or a value of 0 indicates that the
content has already expired and requires revalidation.
If a Cache-Control header is present in the response,
Cloud CDN ignores the Expires header.
The presence of a valid, future Expires header in the response lets the
response be cached, and does not require other cache directives to be specified.
The HTTP/1.0 Pragma header, if present in a response, is ignored and
passed through as-is to the client. Client requests with this header are
passed to the origin and don't impact how a response is served by
Cloud CDN.
Vary headers
The Vary
header indicates that the response varies depending on the client's
request headers. In addition to the request URI, Cloud CDN respects
Vary headers that origin servers include in responses. For example, if a
response specifies Vary: Accept , Cloud CDN uses one cache entry for
requests that specify Accept: image/webp,image/*,*/*;q=0.8 and another for
requests that specify Accept: */* .
The table in the
Non-cacheable content section lists
the Vary headers that allow content to be cached. Other Vary header values
prevent content from being cached.
The FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode does not override this behavior. The Vary
headers are important to avoid cache poisoning between multiple possible origin
server responses. It would be dangerous for FORCE_CACHE_ALL to cause those
responses to be cached.
Vary headers are sometimes used when serving compressed content.
Cloud CDN does not compress or decompress responses itself (unless
dynamic compression is
enabled), but it can serve responses that the origin server has compressed. If your
origin server chooses whether to serve compressed content or uncompressed content based
on the value of the Accept-Encoding request header, make sure that the
response specifies Vary: Accept-Encoding .
When using HTTP headers in the cache key ,
Cloud CDN caches multiple copies of the response based on the values
of the specified request headers, similar to Vary support but without the
need for the origin server to explicitly specify any Vary response header.
If the origin does specify the cache-key headers in the Vary response,
Cloud CDN treats the response correctly, the same as if the
headers were not mentioned in the Vary response.
Expiration times and validation requests
A cache entry's expiration time defines how long a cache entry remains valid.
The value provided by the s-maxage (or max-age or expires ) value allows
for automatic revalidation of stale, user-generated cached content.
When Cloud CDN receives a request, it looks up the corresponding
cache entry and checks its age. If the cache entry exists and is fresh enough,
the response can be served from the cache. If the expiration time has
passed, Cloud CDN attempts to revalidate the cache entry by contacting
one of your backends. This is done before serving the response, unless you
enable serve-while-stale , in
which case revalidation is performed asynchronously.
For some cache modes, you can set TTL values. For more information, see
Using TTL settings and overrides .
The cache mode affects how freshness is determined.
Cache mode
Validation behavior
CACHE_ALL_STATIC
The origin headers ( Cache-Control: s-maxage ,
Cache-Control: max-age , or Expires headers) are
consulted to determine freshness. For static content, if origin headers are
not present, the configured default_ttl
determines freshness. After the static content is older than
default_ttl , Cloud CDN revalidates it.
USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS
Each cache entry in a Cloud CDN cache has an expiration time
defined by the Cache-Control: s-maxage ,
Cache-Control: max-age , or Expires headers in
accordance with
RFC 7234 .
FORCE_CACHE_ALL
Instead of origin headers, the configured default_ttl
determines freshness. After the content is older than
default_ttl , Cloud CDN revalidates it.
If more than one is present, Cache-Control: s-maxage takes
precedence over Cache-Control: max-age , and
Cache-Control: max-age takes precedence over Expires .
By default, when the expiration time value exceeds 30 days (2,592,000
seconds), Cloud CDN treats the expiration value as if it were 2,592,000
seconds. Downstream clients still see the accurate values of max-age and
s-maxage , even if they exceed 30 days.
Eviction
There is no guarantee that a cache entry remains in the cache until it expires
because unpopular entries can be evicted before they expire at any time to
make room for new content. As an upper bound, cache entries that aren't accessed
for 30 days are automatically evicted.
For more information, see
Eviction and expiration .
Use conditional requests for validation
Cloud CDN can attempt to use the information in the cached response
headers to validate the cache entry with the backend. This happens when
both of the following are true:
The previously cached response has a Last-Modified or ETag header.
The client request is a GET request that does not contain
If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match headers.
Cloud CDN performs this validation slightly differently depending on
whether the response was cached by using byte range
requests :
If the response was cached by using byte range requests, Cloud CDN
initiates a separate validation request that includes If-Modified-Since
and If-None-Match headers.
Otherwise, Cloud CDN adds If-Modified-Since and
If-None-Match headers to the client request and forwards the modified request
to the backend.
If the cached copy is still up to date, the backend can validate the existing
cache entry by sending a 304 Not Modified response. In this case, the backend
sends only the response headers, not the response body. Cloud CDN
inserts the new response headers into the cache, updates the expiration time,
and serves the new response headers and cached response body to the client.
If the previously cached response does not have a Last-Modified or an ETag
header, Cloud CDN ignores the expired cache entry and forwards
the client request to the backend unmodified.
Support for byte range requests
A response that satisfies the following criteria indicates that the origin
server supports byte range requests:
Status code: 200 OK or 206 Partial Content
Header: Accept-Ranges: bytes
Header: Content-Length , and for a 206 Partial Content response, a
Content-Range value that indicates the complete length of the origin object.
For example, Content-length: 0-100/999 is cacheable whereas
Content-length: 0-100/* isn't.
Header: Last-Modified and ETag with a strong validator.
Cloud Storage supports byte range requests for most objects. However,
Cloud Storage does not support byte range requests for objects with
Content-Encoding: gzip metadata unless the client request includes an Accept-
Encoding: gzip header. If you have Cloud Storage objects larger than
10 MB, make sure that they don't have Content-Encoding: gzip
metadata. For information about how to edit object metadata, see Viewing and
editing object metadata .
Popular web server software also supports byte range requests. Consult the
documentation for your web server for details about how to enable support. For
more information about byte range requests, see the
HTTP specification .
When an origin server supports byte range requests, a Cloud CDN
cache declines to store an otherwise cacheable response the first time it is
requested if either of the following is true:
The response body is incomplete because the client requested only part of the
content.
The response body is larger than 1 MB (1,048,576 bytes).
When this happens and the response would otherwise satisfy the normal
cacheability requirements , the cache records that the origin
server supports byte range requests for that cache key and forwards the origin
server's response to the client.
On a cache miss, the cache checks whether the origin server is known to support
byte range requests. If byte range requests are known to be supported for the
cache key, the cache does not forward the client request to the external Application Load Balancer.
Instead, the cache initiates its own byte range cache fill
requests for the missing parts of the content.
The origin server returns a 206 Partial Content response when
Cloud CDN initiates its own byte range cache fill request. For a
206 Partial Content response to be considered while caching, it must include
a Content-Range header with a complete-length directive that doesn't
include asterisks, for example, 0-100/999 . Cloud CDN then caches that
returned 206 Partial Content response and uses it to respond to future client
requests for that content.
A cache stores a 206 Partial Content response only when it is received in
response to a byte range request that the cache initiated. Because a cache
doesn't initiate a byte range request unless it had previously recorded that the
origin server supports byte range requests for that cache key, a given cache
doesn't store content that's larger than 1 MB until the second time that
content is accessed.
Due to its distributed nature, Cloud CDN might sometimes fetch the
final chunk from the origin more than once per location. This only impacts the
first few requests per cache key.
Request collapsing (coalescing)
Request collapsing (also called coalescing ) actively collapses multiple
user-driven cache fill requests for the same cache key into a single origin
request per edge node. This can actively reduce the load on the origin, and
applies to both item requests (responses fetched directly) and
chunk requests , where
Cloud CDN uses Range requests to fetch larger objects more
efficiently.
Request collapsing is enabled by default.
Collapsed requests behave in the following manner:
Collapsed requests log both the client-facing request and the (collapsed)
cache fill request.
The leader of the collapsed session is used to make
the origin fill request.
Request attributes that aren't part of the cache key,
such as the User-Agent or Accept-Encoding header, only reflect the
leader of the collapsed session.
Requests that don't have the same cache key cannot be collapsed.
The following diagram shows how requests are coalesced:
Cloud CDN with request collapsing enabled (click to enlarge).
In comparison, with request collapsing disabled or for requests that cannot be
coalesced, the number of origin requests and responses can be equal to the
number of clients attempting to retrieve an object that's not cached.
Cloud CDN without request collapsing enabled (click to enlarge).
For all types of requests, collapsing is enabled by default. For item request
types, you can disable collapsing. We recommend disabling collapsing for item
requests in highly latency sensitive scenarios, such as ad-serving, where origin
load is not a consideration.
The following table summarizes the default behavior and configurability for
different request types.

To disable item request collapsing using the Google Cloud CLI for a backend bucket
that references a Cloud Storage bucket:
Note: Google Cloud CLI support for the --request-coalescing flag was introduced
in Google Cloud CLI version 330.0.0 .
gcloud
Use the gcloud compute backend-services or backend-buckets command:
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--no-request-coalescing
To enable item request collapsing on a backend bucket using the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud
Use the gcloud compute backend-buckets command:
gcloud compute backend-buckets update BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME \
--request-coalescing
To enable item request collapsing using the Google Cloud CLI for a backend service,
including VM groups and external backends:
gcloud
Use the gcloud compute backend-services command:
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--request-coalescing
Requests initiated by Cloud CDN
When your origin server supports byte range requests ,
Cloud CDN can send multiple requests to your origin server in reaction
to a single client request. Cloud CDN can initiate two types of
requests: validation requests and byte range requests.
If the response that indicated that your origin server supported byte range requests
for a particular cache key has expired, Cloud CDN initiates
a validation request to confirm that the content hasn't changed and that your
origin server still supports range requests for the content. If your origin
server responds with a 304 Not Modified response, Cloud CDN
proceeds to serve the content by using byte ranges. Otherwise,
Cloud CDN forwards your origin server's response to the
client. You control expiration times by using the Cache-Control and Expires
response headers .
On a cache miss, Cloud CDN initiates cache fill requests for a
set of byte ranges that overlap the client request. If some ranges of the
content requested by the client are present in the cache,
Cloud CDN serves whatever it can from the cache and sends byte
range requests for only the missing ranges to your origin server.
Each byte range request initiated by Cloud CDN specifies a range
that begins at an offset that's a multiple of 2,097,136 bytes. With the possible
exception of the final range, each range is also 2,097,136 bytes. If
the content isn't a multiple of that size, the final range is smaller. The
size and offsets used in byte range requests might change in the future.
As an example, consider a client request for bytes 1,000,000 through 3,999,999
of content that is not present in the cache. In this example,
Cloud CDN could initiate two GET requests, one for the first
2,097,136 bytes of the content and another for the second 2,097,136 bytes. This
results in 4,194,272 bytes of cache fill even though the client requested only
3,000,000 bytes.
When you use a Cloud Storage bucket as your origin, each GET request is
billed as a separate Class B operation .
You are charged for all GET requests processed by Cloud Storage,
including any requests initiated by Cloud CDN. When a response is
served entirely from a Cloud CDN cache, no GET requests are sent to
Cloud Storage, and you are not charged for any Cloud Storage
operations.
When Cloud CDN initiates a validation request or byte range
request, it does not include client-specific headers such as Cookie or
User-Agent .
In the Cloud Logging
httpRequest.userAgent field,
Cloud-CDN-Google means that Cloud CDN initiated the request.
Bypass the cache
Cache bypass allows requests containing specific request headers to bypass the
cache, even if the content was previously cached.
This section provides information about bypassing the cache with HTTP headers,
such as Pragma and Authorization . This feature is useful when you want to
make sure that your users or customers always have the latest content fetched
fresh from the origin server. You might want to do this for testing, setting up
staging directories, or scripts.
If a specified header matches, the cache is bypassed for all cache mode
settings, even FORCE_CACHE_ALL . Cache bypass results in a large number of
cache misses if the specified headers are common to many requests.
Before you begin
Ensure that Cloud CDN is enabled; for instructions, see
Using Cloud CDN .
If necessary, update to the latest version of the Google Cloud CLI:
gcloud components update
Note: Make sure that you're using gcloud CLI version 324.0.0 or later.
Configure cache bypass
You can specify up to five HTTP header names. Values are case-insensitive.
The header name must be a valid HTTP header field
token .
A header name must not appear more than once in the list of added headers. For
the rules about valid header names, see How custom headers
work .
