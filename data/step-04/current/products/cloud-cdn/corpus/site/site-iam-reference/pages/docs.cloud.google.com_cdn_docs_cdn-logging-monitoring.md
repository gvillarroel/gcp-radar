Logs and metrics for backend services
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document shows you how to configure and use Cloud Logging
and Cloud Monitoring with classic Application Load Balancers,
global external Application Load Balancers, and Cloud CDN.
Logging
You can enable, disable, and view logs for an external Application Load Balancer
backend service .
For external Application Load Balancers with backend
buckets , logging
is automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.
You enable or disable logging for each backend service. You can configure
whether to log all requests or a randomly sampled fraction.
You must ensure that you don't have a logs exclusion that applies to
external Application Load Balancers. For information about how to verify that external Application Load Balancer logs
are allowed, see Log sink
filters .
Note: If the backend service is created
after the General
Availability release of Logging for
external Application Load Balancers, logging is disabled for a backend service.
If you enabled logging during the alpha release or
beta
release , logging continues to be enabled for the backend service.
Logs sampling and collection
The requests and corresponding responses that are handled by load balancer
backend virtual machine (VM) instances are sampled. These sampled requests are
then processed to generate logs. You control the fraction of the requests that
are emitted as log entries according to the
logConfig.sampleRate field .
When logConfig.sampleRate is 1.0 (100%), this means that logs are
generated for all of the requests and written to Cloud Logging.
Optional fields
Log records contain required fields and optional fields. The What is
logged section lists which fields are optional and which are
required. All required fields are always included. You can customize which
optional fields you keep.
If you select include all optional , all optional fields in the log
record format are included in the logs. When new optional fields are added
to the record format, the logs automatically include the new fields.
If you select exclude all optional , all optional fields are omitted.
If you select custom , you can specify the optional fields that you want to
include, such as
tls.protocol,tls.cipher,orca_load_report.cpu_utilization,orca_load_report.mem_utilization .
For information about customizing optional fields, see
Enable logging on a new backend service .
Enabling logging on a new backend service
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Load Balancing page.
Go to Load balancing
Click the name of your load balancer.
Click edit Edit .
Click Backend Configuration .
Select Create a backend service .
Complete the required backend service fields.
In the Logging section, select the Enable logging checkbox.
Set a Sample rate fraction. You can set a number from 0.0 through
1.0 , where 0.0 means that no requests are logged and 1.0 means that
100% of the requests are logged. The default value is 1.0 .
Optional: To include all the optional fields in the logs, in the
Optional fields section, click Include all optional fields .
To finish editing the backend service, click Update .
To finish editing the load balancer, click Update .
gcloud
Create a backend service and enable logging by using the
gcloud compute backend-services create
command .
gcloud compute backend-services create BACKEND_SERVICE \
--global \
--enable-logging \
--logging-sample-rate= VALUE \
--load-balancing-scheme=EXTERNAL_MANAGED \
--logging-optional= LOGGING_OPTIONAL_MODE \
--logging-optional-fields= OPTIONAL_FIELDS
The gcloud compute backend-services create command supports the
following fields:
--global indicates that the backend service is global. Use this field
for backend services used with global external Application Load Balancers.
--enable-logging enables logging for that backend service.
--logging-sample-rate lets you specify a value from
0.0 through 1.0 , where 0.0 means that no requests are logged and
1.0 means that 100% of the requests are logged. This field is only
meaningful with the
--enable-logging parameter. Enabling logging but setting the
sampling rate to 0.0 is equivalent to disabling logging. The default
value is 1.0 .
--logging-optional lets you specify the optional fields that
you want to include in the logs. These fields are supported only with
global external Application Load Balancers.
INCLUDE_ALL_OPTIONAL to include all optional fields.
EXCLUDE_ALL_OPTIONAL (default) to exclude all optional fields.
CUSTOM to include a custom list of optional fields that
you specify in OPTIONAL_FIELDS .
--logging-optional-fields lets you specify a comma-separated list of
optional fields that you want to include in the logs.
For example, tls.protocol,tls.cipher can only be set if
LOGGING_OPTIONAL_MODE is set to CUSTOM .
If you use custom
metrics and want to
log elements of the ORCA load report, you set
LOGGING_OPTIONAL_MODE to CUSTOM and
specify which elements must be logged in the
OPTIONAL_FIELDS field. For example,
orca_load_report.cpu_utilization,orca_load_report.mem_utilization .

View logs
To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the
Google Cloud console, click Guide me :
Guide me
HTTP(S) logs are indexed first by a
forwarding rule ,
then by a URL map .
To view logs, go to the Logs Explorer page:
Go to Logs Explorer
To view all logs, in the Resource filter menu, select Application Load
Balancer > All forwarding_rule_name .
To view logs for one forwarding rule, select a single forwarding rule name.
To view logs for one URL map, select a forwarding rule, and then select a URL
map.
Log fields of type boolean typically only appear if they have a value of
true . If a boolean field has a value of false , that field is omitted from
the log.
UTF-8 encoding
is enforced for log fields. Characters that are not UTF-8
characters are replaced with question marks.
For classic Application Load Balancers and global external Application Load Balancers , you can export
logs-based metrics using
resource logs ( resource.type="http_load_balancer" ). The metrics
created are based on the Application Load Balancer Rule
(Logs-based Metrics) resource ( l7_lb_rule ), which is available under
Cloud Monitoring dashboards instead of under the https_lb_rule resource.
What is logged
External Application Load Balancer log entries contain information useful for
monitoring and debugging your HTTP(S) traffic. Log records contain required
fields, which are the default fields of every log record.
Log records contain optional fields
that add additional information about your HTTP(S) traffic.
Optional fields can be omitted to save storage costs.
Some log fields are in a multi-field format, with more than one piece of data
in a given field. For example, the tls field is of the TlsInfo
format, which contains the earlyDataRequest field.

0
config_not_found
The load balancer is missing project configuration. This can occur
intermittently after you've made configuration changes that add
a new resource.
Another cause of the error is that the first-layer GFE
fails to communicate with the second-layer GFE. This can be due to an
internal error, such as an in-progress rollout, load balancer overload, or
intermittent configuration issues.
These errors are transient in nature and are expected to fall well within
the SLA .
However, if the error rate exceeds 0.01%, please contact
Google Cloud support
for further assistance.
404 , 502 , 503
direct_response

a content length or transfer-encoding chunked header.
400 , 403 , 411
retriable_error
The load balancer has encountered an infrastructure error and the
request can be retried. This can occur intermittently after you've made
configuration changes that add or reference a new resource.
This can also occur when the first-layer GFE fails to communicate with
the second-layer GFE due to an internal error, such as an in-progress
rollout, load balancer overload, or intermittent configuration issue.
These errors are transient in nature and are expected to fall well within
the SLA .

Logging for Cloud Armor
The table for statusDetail HTTP failure messages contains some messages that
apply to Cloud Armor. For more information about what
Cloud Armor logs, see Use request logging .
Logging for Shared VPC deployments
Application Load Balancer logs and metrics are typically exported to the project
that has the forwarding rule. Therefore, service admins—owners or users of
projects where the backend service is created—won't have access to the
load balancer's logs and metrics by default. You can use IAM
roles to grant these permissions to service admins. To learn more about the
IAM roles that are available, and the steps to provide access,
see Grant access to
Monitoring .
Interacting with the logs
You can interact with the external Application Load Balancer logs by using the
Cloud Logging API. The Logging API provides ways to interactively
filter logs that have specific fields set. It exports matching logs to
Cloud Logging, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Pub/Sub.
For more information about the Logging API, see
Logging API overview .
Monitoring
The load balancer exports monitoring data to
Monitoring .
You can use monitoring metrics to do the following:
Evaluate a load balancer's configuration, usage, and performance
Troubleshoot problems
Improve resource utilization and user experience
Note: Metrics are based on sampled traffic, that is, they won't correspond
one-to-one with actual requests. The sampling rate is dynamic and cannot be
adjusted.
Metric reporting frequency and retention
Metrics for the external Application Load Balancers are exported to Cloud Monitoring in
1-minute granularity batches. Monitoring data is retained for six (6) weeks.
The dashboard provides data analysis in default intervals of 1H (one hour),
6H (six hours), 1D (one day), 1W (one week), and 6W (six weeks). You can
manually request analysis in any interval from 6W to 1 minute.
Monitoring metrics
You can monitor the following metrics for external Application Load Balancers.
The following metrics for global external Application Load Balancers are
reported into Cloud Monitoring .
Note: The Response code class fraction metric is available per entire
load balancer only, with no further breakdowns available.
Filter this table:
Metric
Name
Description
Backend configured rate ( Preview )
network.googleapis.com/loadbalancer/backend/configured_rate
The maximum rate in requests per second configured per backend group.
This is the result of scaling the target capacity by the ( capacity scaler ),
if specified.
Backend configured utilization ( Preview )
network.googleapis.com/loadbalancer/backend/configured_utilization
The maximum CPU utilization capacity as a fraction, configured per
backend group. This is the result of scaling the target capacity by the
capacity scaler, if specified.
Backend error rate ( Preview )
network.googleapis.com/loadbalancer/backend/error_rate
The errors served by each backend group per second.
Backend fullness ( Preview )
network.googleapis.com/loadbalancer/backend/fullness
The current fullness of each backend group as a percentage, based on the
load balancer's
balancing mode .
Backend latencies †
loadbalancing.googleapis.com/https/backend_latencies
A distribution of the backend latency. Backend latency is the time
in milliseconds between
the first byte of the request received by the backend and the last byte of
the response received by the proxy. It includes: the time taken for the
request to be sent from the proxy to the backend, the time taken by the
backend to process the request, and the time taken for the response to be
sent back to the proxy.
Backend load balancing custom metrics ( Preview )
network.googleapis.com/loadbalancer/backend/lb_custom_metric
The current utilization by each backend group, based on your defined
custom metrics.
Backend rate ( Preview )
network.googleapis.com/loadbalancer/backend/rate
The requests received by each backend group per second.
Backend utilization ( Preview )
network.googleapis.com/loadbalancer/backend/utilization
The aggregate CPU utilization of the VMs in the group as a fraction.
Configured in-flight request ( Preview )
loadbalancer/backend/configured_in_flight_requests
The maximum in-flight requests for each backend group. In-flight
requests determine how the load is spread for requests running for
more than a second.
In-flight request ( Preview )
loadbalancer/backend/in_flight_requests
Number of queries in progress by each backend group.
Request count
loadbalancing.googleapis.com/https/request_count
The number of requests served by the external Application Load Balancer
Request bytes count
loadbalancing.googleapis.com/https/request_bytes_count
The number of bytes sent as requests from clients to the external Application Load Balancer
Response bytes count
loadbalancing.googleapis.com/https/response_bytes_count
The number of bytes sent as responses from the external Application Load Balancer to clients
Total latencies
loadbalancing.googleapis.com/https/total_latencies
A distribution of the total latency. Total latency is the time in
milliseconds between the
first byte of the request received by the proxy and the last byte of the
response sent by the proxy. It includes: the time taken by the proxy to process
the request, the time taken for the request to be sent from the proxy to the
backend, the time taken by the backend to process the request, the
time taken for the response to be sent back to the proxy, and the time taken
for the proxy to process the response and send the response to the client.
It doesn't include the RTT between the client and the proxy. Additionally,
pauses between requests on the same connection that use Connection:
keep-alive do not affect the measurement. This measurement is typically
reduced to the 95th percentile in Cloud Monitoring views.
For websocket connections, this field refers to the entire time duration
of the connection. *
Example: A load balancer has 1 request per second from the UK,
all with 100 ms latency, and 9 requests per second from the US,
all with 50 ms latency. Over a certain minute there were 60 requests
from the UK and 540 requests from the US. Monitoring metrics preserves
the distribution over all dimensions. You can request information
such as the following:
median overall latency (300/600) - 50 ms
median UK latency (30/60) - 100 ms
95th percentile overall latency (570/600) - 100 ms
Frontend RTT †
loadbalancing.googleapis.com/https/frontend_tcp_rtt
A distribution of the frontend RTT. Frontend RTT is the time in
milliseconds it takes for data to travel from the client to the proxy
and back again. It includes the time taken for a request to travel from
the client to the proxy and back from the proxy to the client. This is
not updated during the lifetime of the connection. For example, setting
up a (TCP) connection with a 3-way handshake would take 1.5 RTTs.
When requests are processed, the load balancer samples and averages the
time it takes for data to travel back and forth between the client and the
proxy, and then logs a smoothed RTT value. Smoothed RTT is an algorithm that
deals with variations and anomalies that might occur in RTT measurements.
Response code class fraction
Fraction of total external Application Load Balancer responses that are in each
response code class ( 2 xx , 4 xx , ...).
In Monitoring, this value is
only available on default dashboards. It isn't available for custom
dashboards. You can use the Monitoring API to set alerts for it.
Backend request count
loadbalancing.googleapis.com/https/backend_request_count
The number of requests sent from the external Application Load Balancer to the
backends.
Backend request bytes count
loadbalancing.googleapis.com/https/backend_request_bytes_count
The number of bytes sent as requests from the external Application Load Balancer to the
backends.
Backend response bytes count
loadbalancing.googleapis.com/https/backend_response_bytes_count
The number of bytes sent as responses from the backends (including
cache) to the external Application Load Balancer.
* For monitoring websocket connections, create a backend service
specifically for websockets.
† The sum of Frontend RTT and Backend latencies might not be less
than or equal to Total latencies. This is because although we poll RTT over the
socket from the GFE to the client at the time the HTTP response is acknowledged,
we rely on kernel reporting for some of these measurements, and we cannot
be sure that the kernel will have an RTT measurement for the given
HTTP response. The end result is a smoothed RTT value that is also affected
by previous HTTP responses, SYN/ACKs, and SSL handshakes that aren't affecting
current HTTP request actual timings.
Filtering dimensions for metrics
You can apply filters for metrics for external Application Load Balancers.
Metrics are aggregated for each classic Application Load Balancer and
global external Application Load Balancer. You can filter aggregated metrics by
the following dimensions for resource.type="http_load_balancer" or
resource.type="https_lb_rule" . Note that not all dimensions are available on
all metrics.
Filter this table:
Property
Description
backend_scope
The Google Cloud scope
( region or zone )
of the backend service instance group that served the connection.
If no instance group was available or if the request was served by another
entity, you see one of the following values instead of the region
or zone of the backend service instance group.
FRONTEND_5 xx : an internal error occurred
before the GFE could select a backend. The GFE returned
5 xx to the client.
INVALID_BACKEND: the GFE couldn't find a healthy backend to assign
the request to, so it returned a 5 xx status code to
the requestor.
NO_BACKEND_SELECTED: either an error or interruption occurred before
a backend was selected, a URL redirect occurred, or a
classic Application Load Balancer with serverless backends returned a
200 OK response.
MULTIPLE_BACKENDS: the request was served by potentially multiple
backends. This can happen when Cloud CDN has served the request
partially from its cache and has also sent one or more
byte range
requests to the backend. Use the backend_scope
breakdown to visualize each load balancer-to-backend request.
When this breakdown is chosen, the charts show backend metrics (load
balancer-to-backends), not frontend metrics (client-to-load balancer).
backend_type
The name of the backend group that served the client's request.
Can be INSTANCE GROUP , NETWORK_ENDPOINT_GROUP ,
or UNKNOWN is returned if the backend wasn't assigned.
If no backend group was available or if the request was served by
another entity, one of the following values is displayed instead of a
backend group.
FRONTEND_5XX: an internal error occurred before the GFE could select
a backend. The GFE returned 5 xx to the client.
INVALID_BACKEND: the GFE couldn't find a healthy backend to assign
the request to, so it returned a 5 xx status code to
the requestor.
NO_BACKEND_SELECTED: either an error or interruption occurred before
a backend was selected, a URL redirect occurred, or a
classic Application Load Balancer with serverless backends returned a
200 OK response.
MULTIPLE_BACKENDS: the request was served by potentially multiple
backends. This can happen when Cloud CDN has served the request
partially from its cache and has also sent one or more
byte range
requests to the backend. Use the backend_scope
breakdown to visualize each load balancer-to-backend request.
backend_target_type
The name of the backend service that served the request. Can be
BACKEND_SERVICE , BACKEND_BUCKET ,
UNKNOWN if the backend wasn't assigned, or
NO_BACKEND_SELECTED if an error or interruption occurred

classic Application Load Balancer with serverless backends returned a
200 OK response.
matched_url_path_rule
The URL map path rule that matched the prefix of the HTTP(S) request
(up to 50 characters).
forwarding_rule_name
The name of the forwarding rule used by the client to send the request.
url_map_name
The URL map path rule or route rule configured as part of the URL map
key. Can be UNMATCHED or UNKNOWN as fallbacks.
UNMATCHED refers to a request that doesn't match any URL
path rules, so url_map_name uses the default path rule.
UNKNOWN indicates an internal error.
target_proxy_name
The name of the target HTTP(S) proxy object referenced by the forwarding
rule.
backend_target_name
The name of the backend target. The target can be either a backend
service or backend bucket. UNKNOWN is returned if a backend
wasn't assigned.
backend_name
The name of the backend instance group, bucket, or NEG.

before a backend was selected, a URL redirect occurred, or a
classic Application Load Balancer with serverless backends returned a
200 OK response.
backend_scope_type
The type of the scope of the backend group. Can be GLOBAL ,
REGION , ZONE , MULTIPLE_BACKENDS , or
NO_BACKEND_SELECTED if an error or interruption occurred
before a backend was selected, a URL redirect occurred, or a
classic Application Load Balancer with serverless backends returned a
200 OK response, or other possible backend_type outputs.
MULTIPLE_BACKENDS is used when chunk caching is used.
