Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This example shows how to use URL map
redirects to redirect all
requests from HTTP to HTTPS. This example shows how you set up
redirects by using the well-known ports 80 (for HTTP) and 443 (for HTTPS).
However, you're not required to use these specific port numbers. Each forwarding
rule for an Application Load Balancer can reference a single port from
1-65535 .
HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt HTTP requests and responses, making it
safer and more secure. A website that uses HTTPS has https:// in the beginning
of its URL instead of http:// .
For new HTTPS Application Load Balancers
If you're creating a new HTTPS Application Load Balancer, you can use the
Google Cloud console to set up an HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect.
While creating the load balancer's frontend, use the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the load balancer's configuration
page.
Go to Load balancing (Create global external Application Load Balancer)
For Load balancer name , enter a name.
Click Frontend configuration .
For Protocol , select HTTPS (includes HTTP/2) .
For IP address , click Create IP address . Enter a name for the new static IP address and click Reserve .
For Certificate , select an SSL certificate.
To create the redirect, select the Enable HTTP to HTTPS Redirect checkbox.
Click Done .
Complete the backend and other required configurations.
Click Create .
You must select the HTTPS protocol and use a reserved IP
address (not ephemeral) to be able to select the checkbox.
Figure 1. HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect checkbox in the Google Cloud console (click to enlarge).
Depending on your backend type, use the Google Cloud console instructions from
one of the following guides to complete this setup:
Compute Engine
backend
Backend bucket
Cloud Run, App Engine, or Cloud Run functions backend
Setting the Enable HTTP to HTTPS Redirect checkbox automatically creates an
additional partial HTTP load balancer consisting of a URL map, a forwarding
rule, and a target HTTP proxy. This partial HTTP load balancer uses the same IP
address as your HTTPS load balancer and redirects HTTP requests to your load
balancer's HTTPS frontend. It uses 301 Moved Permanently as the default
redirect response code.
After the HTTPS load balancer is created, you can see the partial HTTP load
balancer in the list of load balancers, with a -redirect suffix.
Test your setup by using the steps in Testing the HTTP-to-HTTPS
redirect .
Note:
The Enable HTTP to HTTPS Redirect checkbox is only
available while creating a new HTTPS load balancer. It is not available
when editing an existing load balancer.
There is no equivalent gcloud or API parameter for this
checkbox. If you want to use gcloud
or the API to create your HTTPS load balancer, use the
steps in the Redirecting traffic to your HTTPS
load balancer section to create the redirect.
For existing load balancers
If you already have an HTTPS Application Load Balancer (called here
LB1 ) that is serving HTTPS traffic on port 443, you must create a partial
HTTP Application Load Balancer (called here LB2 ) with the following setup:
The same frontend IP address used by LB1
A redirect configured in the URL map
This partial HTTP load balancer uses the same IP address as your HTTPS load
balancer and redirects HTTP requests to your load balancer's HTTPS frontend.
This architecture is shown in the following diagram.
Figure 2. HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect configuration architecture (click to enlarge).
Redirecting traffic to your HTTPS load balancer
After you have verified that your HTTPS load balancer (LB1) is working,
you can create the partial HTTP load balancer (LB2) with its frontend
configured to redirect traffic to LB1.
This example uses the 301 response code. You can instead use a different
response code .
To configure the redirect with gcloud , you must import a YAML file and make
sure that your target HTTP proxy points to the URL map that redirects
traffic. If you're using the Google Cloud console, this is handled for you.
Regional external Application Load Balancers aren't supported in the Google Cloud console.
gcloud
Create a YAML file /tmp/web-map-http.yaml . This example uses
MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT as the response code.
kind : compute#urlMap
name : web-map-http
defaultUrlRedirect :
redirectResponseCode : MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT
httpsRedirect : True
tests :
- description : Test with no query parameters
host : example.com
path : /test/
expectedOutputUrl : https://example.com/test/
expectedRedirectResponseCode : 301
- description : Test with query parameters
host : example.com
path : /test/?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2
expectedOutputUrl : https://example.com/test/?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2
expectedRedirectResponseCode : 301
Validate the URL map.
gcloud compute url-maps validate --source /tmp/web-map-http.yaml
If the tests pass and the command outputs a success message,
save the changes to the URL map.
Create the HTTP load balancer's URL map by importing the YAML
file. The name for this URL map is web-map-http .
gcloud compute url-maps import web-map-http \
--source /tmp/web-map-http.yaml \
--global
If you are updating an existing URL map, the following prompt appears:
Url Map [web-map-http] will be overwritten.
Do you want to continue (Y/n)?
To continue, press Y .
Verify that the URL map is updated. Your HTTP load balancer's URL map
should look something like this:
gcloud compute url-maps describe web-map-http
creationTimestamp : '2020-03-23T10:53:44.976-07:00'
defaultUrlRedirect :
httpsRedirect : true
redirectResponseCode : MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT
fingerprint : 3A5N_RLrED8=
id : '2020316695093397831'
kind : compute#urlMap
name : web-map-http
selfLink : https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/urlMaps/web-map-http
Create a new target HTTP proxy or update an existing target HTTP proxy,
using web-map-http as the URL map.
gcloud compute target-http-proxies create http-lb-proxy \
--url-map=web-map-http \
--global
OR
gcloud compute target-http-proxies update http-lb-proxy \
--url-map=web-map-http \
--global
Create a forwarding rule to route incoming requests to
the proxy. The --address flag specifies
lb-ipv4-1 , which is the same
IP address used for the external HTTPS load balancer.
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create http-content-rule \
--load-balancing-scheme=EXTERNAL_MANAGED \
--address=lb-ipv4-1 \
--network-tier=PREMIUM \
--global \
--target-http-proxy=http-lb-proxy \
--ports=80
Add a custom HSTS header
When you add the HTTP
Strict-Transport-Security header to your HTTPS load balancer's backend service, the load
balancer sends the custom header to the client so that the next time the client
tries to access the URL through HTTP, the browser redirects the request. The
header settings are as follows:
Header name: Strict-Transport-Security
Header value: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
To add the custom header to the backend service configuration, use the
--custom-response-header flag.
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME_LB1 \
--global \
--custom-response-header='Strict-Transport-Security:max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload'
For more information, see Creating custom
headers .
Testing the HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect
Note the reserved IP address that you are using for both load balancers.
gcloud compute addresses describe lb-ipv4-1
--format="get(address)"
--global
Important: If LB1 and LB2 don't have the same IP
address, the redirect won't work. In this case,
delete the forwarding
rule in LB2 (HTTP load balancer) and create a
new one that uses the same IP address as the forwarding rule in LB1 (HTTPS
load balancer).
In this example, assume that the reserved IP address is 34.98.77.106 . The
http://34.98.77.106/ URL redirects to https://34.98.77.106/ .
After a few minutes have passed, you can test this by running the following
curl command.
curl -v http://hostname.com
Sample output:
* Connected to 34.98.77.106 (34.98.77.106) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: hostname.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.0
