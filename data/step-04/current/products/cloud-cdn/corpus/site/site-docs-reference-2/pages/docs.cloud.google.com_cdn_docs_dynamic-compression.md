Enable dynamic compression
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Dynamic compression automatically compresses responses served by Cloud CDN.
The size of the data sent over the network is reduced by 60% to 85% in typical
cases .
The size reduction reduces the time it takes to download content. For important
assets like stylesheets (CSS), scripts (JavaScript), and video manifests
(HLS/DASH), this can reduce page load and video start times.
You can learn more about the benefits of compressing responses in the
Web Fundamentals
guide .
You can enable compression on a backend service or a backend bucket.
Note: Dynamic compression is configured on a backend service or a backend bucket
and cannot be configured in a URL map. However, you can apply caching
policies within a URL map for more granular control. If compression is enabled
on the backend, the responses that meet the compression criteria will still be
compressed.
Example use cases
Dynamic compression directly reduces the size of data sent from the
Cloud CDN edge to the client. This can directly do the following:
Reduce the size of CSS and JavaScript, helping web pages render
faster and reducing the time to First Contentful
Paint , an
important web performance metric.
Have a large, positive impact when caching REST API responses, such as
JSON payloads. These payloads compress well due to the repeated keys,
whitespace, and braces. Caching public APIs for 5-10 seconds is a popular
approach to reducing origin load while maintaining the freshness of data.
Even without caching, compressing these responses can reduce the total
bytes sent by up to 90%.
Improve playback start time for video delivery and join latency for
live streaming. Large live playlists (manifests) have a significant amount
of repeated data, including the host + path prefix of each segment, as well
as the HLS or DASH playlist metadata. The faster the playlist loads or
playlist updates can be downloaded, the less time a client is waiting
to parse and start downloading the referenced video segments. HLS and DASH
playlists often see a total size reduction of more than 90%.
Before you begin
Make sure that you have the following:
A Cloud CDN-enabled backend configured. If
you don't have
Cloud CDN configured, you can follow one of the
setup guides .
Your backend has compressible content ready
to serve, such as web assets or video manifests between 1 KiB and 10 MiB
(inclusive).
Clients don't rely on fetching partial content with
range requests or with strong ETags . These are
incompatible with dynamic compression.
Clients can handle responses without Content-Length
headers. For example, cache misses that Cloud CDN compresses
don't have Content-Length headers.
The IAM
Compute Load Balancer Admin role
( roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin ),
which is required to make changes to your backend configuration.
Enable compression on a backend service or backend bucket
To enable compression, follow these steps.
Console
Add a new origin
To add and set up a new origin, follow the instructions in
Setup overview for the appropriate type of backend.
When creating your origin, use the Advanced options section to configure
dynamic compression by selecting Automatic in the Compression mode
list.
Edit an existing origin
To edit an existing Cloud CDN origin:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud CDN Origins
page.
Go to Origins
Click the origin name that you want to edit, and then click Edit .
In the Origin basics section, click Next .
In the Host and path rules section, click Next .
In the Cache performance section, navigate to Advanced options .
In the Compression mode list, select Automatic .
To apply your changes, click Done .
gcloud
For backend services, use the gcloud compute backend-services
create command or
gcloud compute backend-services
update command
with the --compression-mode flag.
For backend buckets, use the gcloud compute backend-buckets create command
or the gcloud compute backend-buckets update command
with the --compression-mode flag.
For a new backend service, use the create command:
gcloud compute backend-services create BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--compression-mode=AUTOMATIC
For an existing backend service, use the update command:
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME \
--compression-mode=AUTOMATIC
For a new backend bucket, use the create command:
gcloud compute backend-buckets create BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME
--compression-mode=AUTOMATIC
For an existing backend bucket, use the update command:
gcloud compute backend-buckets update BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME
--compression-mode=AUTOMATIC
The compression-mode can be one of the following:
AUTOMATIC : Automatically uses the best compression
based on the Accept-Encoding header sent by the client. In most cases,
this results in Brotli compression being favored.
DISABLED (default): Disables compression.
API
For backend services, use the
backendServices.insert method or the
backendServices.update method .
For backend buckets, use the
backendBuckets.insert method or the
backendBuckets.update method .
Use one of the following commands:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendServices
PUT https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendServices/ BACKEND_SERVICE
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendBuckets
PUT https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/backendBuckets/ BACKEND_BUCKET
Add the following snippet to the JSON request body:
"compressionMode": AUTOMATIC
The compression-mode can be one of the following:
AUTOMATIC (recommended): Automatically uses the best compression
based on the Accept-Encoding header sent by the client. In most cases,
this results in Brotli compression being favored.
DISABLED (default): Disables compression.
Within a few minutes, your configuration propagates to all edge locations.
Compressible content served from the backend is compressed before being
delivered to the client.
Compression modes
The default compression mode is DISABLED .
AUTOMATIC mode allows Cloud CDN to choose the best compression method
based on the following:
The client's accepted encoding
The response's anticipated compression ratio
Cloud CDN's compression speed (throughput)
Brotli can yield an additional 10% to 20%
reduction in download size for most content types over gzip, with similar
decompression performance, making it faster overall when considering download
time and decompression speed on the client.
Cloud CDN indicates the chosen compression method as
gzip or brotli in the Content-Encoding header in the response.
Cloud CDN determines the compression level to balance
total download size and CPU cost on the client. Higher compression levels don't
always benefit performance, especially on lower-powered mobile devices.
When Cloud CDN initially compresses content, it removes the
Content-Length header from the response; this is necessary to allow
the response to be served as quickly as possible because the full content
length is unknown until the entire response has been compressed.
After a response has been compressed and cached, Cloud CDN might
include the Content-Length header in subsequent responses.
(For HTTP/1.1 and earlier, Cloud CDN uses Transfer-Encoding:
chunked in the response when it doesn't use Content-Length .)
When is a response compressed?
If a request has an Accept-Encoding header that explicitly lists support for
either gzip or Brotli algorithms, then uncompressed responses served from the
backend (origin) with a Content-Type header that matches the
compressible content types are compressed with gzip or
Brotli, accordingly. If a request has no Accept-Encoding header, or if it has
Accept-Encoding: * , the response is not compressed.
For example, given an Accept-Encoding header in a client request, the response
is compressed (or not) according to the information in the following table:
Accept-Encoding request header
Response encoding
gzip, compress, br
Brotli (br)
deflate
Not compressed
deflate, gzip
gzip
identity
Not compressed
*
Not compressed
Compressible content types
Dynamic compression applies to the following MIME types, based on the
Content-Type HTTP response header. Responses that don't have a Content-Type
response header aren't compressed.
Common content types and their MIME types include the following:
HTML content: text/html
Stylesheets: text/css
JavaScript: application/javascript
JSON: application/json
HLS playlists: application/x-mpegURL or application/vnd.apple.mpegURL
DASH manifests: application/dash+xml
The following table summarizes how the MIME type affects compressibility.
Compressible MIME types

application/x-javascript
application/x-sdch-dictionary

application/json
application/json+protobuf
application/signed-exchange

Image and video formats (such as image/jpeg , image/png , and video/mpeg4 )
are almost always already compressed, so Cloud CDN doesn't compress
them. Re-compressing an already compressed response rarely reduces file size,
and clients might exhibit unexpected behavior when receiving a response of this
kind.
When is a response not compressed?
Dynamic compression doesn't compress a response that has one or
more of the following characteristics:
The response doesn't have a Content-Type header that matches a
compressible content type .
It doesn't have a Content-Length header.
It has a Content-Encoding header.
It's smaller than 1 KiB.
The time spent compressing and decompressing often offsets any benefits.
There's also less content to compress, which can reduce the effectiveness
of compression and lead to a lower compression ratio.
It's larger than 10 MiB.
It has a Cache-Control: no-transform header.
Range requests
When Cloud CDN compresses a response, Cloud CDN
adds an Accept-Ranges: none header and replaces any existing Accept-Ranges
headers. Cache hits for such responses ignore Range headers.
This prevents serving incorrect partial content to clients because there is no
way to be sure whether a client expects a range of bytes from the compressed or
uncompressed form of a resource.
ETags
When dynamic compression compresses a response, any strong ETag headers are
weakened, as required by RFC 7232 section
2.3 .
For example, ETag: "xyzzy" is replaced with ETag: W/"xyzzy" .
Vary header
When serving a response that has the potential to be compressed (depending on
the request), Cloud CDN adds the Vary: Accept-Encoding header to the
response.
Summary of response changes
The following table summarizes the changes that Cloud CDN makes to
a response's headers when compression has occurred:
Response header
Header value after compression
Content-Encoding
Set to gzip or brotli .
ETag
Any strong entity tag is replaced with a weakened version,
indicated by the prefix W/ .
Accept-Ranges
Set to the value none .
Content-Length
Might be removed entirely, or if present, set to the length
of the compressed body content.
Transfer-Encoding
For HTTP/1.1 and older protocols, if Cloud CDN removes
Content-Length , it adds this header, with its value set to
chunked , and chunks the body of the response.
Logging
The Cloud CDN logs include a compressionStatus field in the
jsonPayload indicating whether the response was compressed by the load
balancer as well as the compression type.
{
insertId: "1c02hw9g3gjay67"
jsonPayload: {
@type: "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.loadbalancing.type.LoadBalancerLogEntry"
statusDetails: "response_sent_by_backend"
cacheId: "IAD-862d661f"
compressionStatus: "br"
}
}
Billing
When a response is compressed by Cloud CDN or Cloud Load Balancing,
the relevant outbound cache data transfer or outbound internet data transfer
(respectively) is measured against the final compressed bytes sent to the client.
If you are serving a large amount of compressible responses, this can result
in a reduction in your monthly outbound data transfer fees, as well as increased
performance for end users.
Metrics
When compression is enabled, the existing https/response_bytes_count metric
under loadbalancing.googleapis.com reports the compressed response size.
You can expect to see a drop in total response bytes (and outbound data transfer
throughput).
If you are serving a large amount of text-based content that compresses well,
such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or JSON, you might see a large drop in response
bytes.
