Profile Cloud SQL data in an organization or folder
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to configure Cloud SQL data discovery at the
level of an organization or folder. If you want to profile a project, see
Profile Cloud SQL data in a single project .
For more information about the discovery service, see Data
profiles .
How it works
The following is a high-level workflow for profiling Cloud SQL data:
Create a scan configuration .
After you create a scan configuration, Sensitive Data Protection starts
identifying your Cloud SQL instances and creating a default
connection for each instance. Depending on the number of instances in scope
of discovery, this process can take a few hours. You can exit the
Google Cloud console and check your connections later.
Grant the required IAM roles to the service agent associated
with your scan
configuration .
When the default connections are ready, give Sensitive Data Protection
access to your Cloud SQL instances by updating each
connection with
the proper database user credentials. You can provide existing database user
accounts or create database
users .
Note: For Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instances, you have the option to use the
service agent as the database
user instead.
Recommended: Increase the maximum number of
connections
that Sensitive Data Protection can use to profile your data. Increasing
the connections can speed up discovery.
Supported services
This feature supports the following:
Cloud SQL for MySQL
Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
Cloud SQL for SQL Server isn't supported.
Processing and storage regions
Sensitive Data Protection is a regional and multi-regional service; it
doesn't distinguish between zones. When Sensitive Data Protection
profiles a Cloud SQL instance, the data is processed in its current
region, but not necessarily its current zone. For example, if a
Cloud SQL instance is stored in the us-central1-a zone, then
Sensitive Data Protection processes and stores the data profiles in the
us-central1 region.
For more information, see Data residency
considerations .
Before you begin
Confirm that you have the IAM permissions that are required to
configure data profiles at the
organization level.
If you don't have the Organization Administrator
( roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin ) or Security Admin
( roles/iam.securityAdmin ) role, you can still create a scan
configuration. However, after you create the scan configuration, someone with
either of those roles must grant data profiling access to your service agent.
You must have an inspection template in each region where you have data to be
profiled. If you want to use a single template for multiple regions, you can use
a template that is stored in the global region. If organizational
policies prevent you from creating an inspection template in the global region, then
you must set a dedicated inspection template for each region. For more
information, see Data
residency considerations .
This task lets you create an inspection template in the global region only.
If you need dedicated inspection templates for one or more regions, you must
create those
templates
before performing this task.
To send Pub/Sub notifications to a topic when certain events
occur—such as when Sensitive Data Protection profiles a new
table— create a Pub/Sub
topic before performing this task.
You can configure Sensitive Data Protection to automatically attach tags to your
resources. This feature lets you conditionally grant access to those
resources based on their calculated sensitivity levels. If you want to use
this feature, you must first complete the tasks in Control
IAM access to resources based on data
sensitivity .
You can configure Sensitive Data Protection to automatically attach aspects to
the profiled Cloud SQL resources based on discovery insights. If you
want to use this feature, you must enable the integration of universal
catalog on your Cloud SQL for MySQL
instance
or Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
instance .
To generate data profiles, you need a
service agent container and a service agent
within it. This task lets you create them automatically.
Create a scan configuration
Go to the Create scan configuration page.
Go to Create scan configuration
Go to your organization. On the toolbar, click the project selector and
select your organization.
The following sections provide more information about the steps in the Create
scan configuration page. At the end of each section, click Continue .
Select a discovery type
Select Cloud SQL .
Select scope
Do one of the following:
To configure profiling at the organization level, select Scan entire
organization .
To configure profiling at the level of a folder, select Scan selected
folder . Click Browse and select the folder.
Manage schedules
If the default profiling
frequency suits
your needs, you can skip this section of the Create scan configuration page.
Configure this section for the following reasons:
To make fine-grained adjustments to the profiling frequency of all your data
or certain subsets of your data.
To specify the tables that you don't want to profile.
To specify the tables that you don't want profiled more than once.
To make fine-grained adjustments to profiling frequency, follow these steps:
Click Add schedule .
In the Filters section, you define one or more filters that specify
which tables are in the schedule's scope. A table is considered to be in the
schedule's scope if it matches at least one of the filters defined.
To configure a filter, specify at least one of the following:
A project ID or a regular expression that specifies one or more
projects.
An instance ID or a regular expression that specifies one or more
instances.
A database ID or a regular expression that specifies one or more
databases.
A table ID or a regular expression that specifies one or more tables.
Enter this value in the Database resource name or regular expression
field.
Regular expressions must follow
RE2 syntax .
For example, if you want all tables in a database to be included in the
filter, enter the database ID in the Database ID field.
To match a filter, a table must meet all the regular expressions specified
within that filter.
If you want to add more filters, click Add filter and repeat this step.
Click Frequency .
In the Frequency section, specify whether the discovery service
should profile the tables you selected and, if so, how often:
If you never want the tables to be profiled, turn off
Do profile this data .
If you want the tables to be profiled at least once, leave
Do profile this data on.
In the succeeding fields in this section, you specify whether the system
should reprofile your data and what events should trigger a reprofile
operation. For more information, see Frequency of data profile
generation .
For On a schedule , specify how often you want the
the tables to be reprofiled. The tables are
reprofiled regardless of whether they underwent any changes.
For When schema changes , specify how often
Sensitive Data Protection should check if the selected tables had
schema changes after they were last profiled. Only tables with
schema changes will be reprofiled.
For Types of schema change , specify which types of schema changes
should trigger a reprofile operation. Select one of the following:
New columns : Reprofile the tables that gained new columns.
Removed columns : Reprofile the tables that had columns
removed.
For example, suppose you have tables that gain new columns every day,
and you need to profile their contents each time.
You can set When schema changes to Reprofile daily , and set
Types of schema change to New columns .
For When inspect template changes , specify whether you want your data to be
reprofiled when the associated inspection template is updated, and if so, how
often.
Note: You specify the inspection templates to
use in the Select inspection template step
on this page.
An inspection template change is detected when either of the following occurs:
The name of an inspection template changes in your scan configuration.
The updateTime
of an inspection template changes.
For example, if you set an inspection template for the us-west1 region
and you update that inspection template, then only data in the us-west1
region will be reprofiled.
Click Conditions .
In the Conditions section, you specify the types of database resources
that you want to profile. By default, Sensitive Data Protection is set to
profile all supported database resource types. When
Sensitive Data Protection adds support for more database resource types,
those types will automatically be profiled, too.
Optional: If you want to explicitly set the database resource types that you
want to profile, follow these steps:
Click the Database resource types field.
Select the database resource types that you want to profile.
If Sensitive Data Protection later adds discovery support for more
Cloud SQL database resource types, those types will only be profiled
if you return to this list and select them.
Click Done .
Optional: To add more schedules, click Add schedule and repeat the
previous steps.
To specify precedence between schedules, reorder them using the arrow_upward up and arrow_downward down arrows.
The order of the schedules specifies how conflicts between schedules are
resolved. If a table matches the filters of two different schedules,
the schedule higher in the schedules list dictates the profiling frequency
for that table.
Note: If your discovery pricing mode is subscription
mode ,
the rate at which
Sensitive Data Protection profiles your data is affected by how much
capacity you purchased. To determine your daily profiling capacity, see
Monitoring
utilization .
If you have under-provisioned
capacity , then the
profiling frequencies that you set in your schedules might not be followed.
If there is a backlog of data to be profiled, the schedule order
doesn't dictate the order in which Sensitive Data Protection profiles
the data in the backlog. Rather, all data resources in scope
get a randomly assigned slot in the queue.
Optional: Edit or turn off Catch-all schedule .
The last schedule in the list is the catch-all schedule. This schedule covers
the tables in your selected scope that don't match any of the
schedules that you created. The catch-all schedule follows the system
default profiling
frequency .
To adjust the catch-all schedule, click
edit Edit schedule , and then adjust
the settings as needed.
To prevent Sensitive Data Protection from profiling any resource that is
covered by the catch-all schedule, turn off Profile the resources
that don't match any custom schedule .
Select inspection template
Depending on how you want to provide an inspection configuration, choose one of
the following options. Regardless of which option you choose,
Sensitive Data Protection scans your data in the region where that data is stored.
That is, your data doesn't leave its region of origin.
Option 1: Create an inspection template
Choose this option if you want to create a new inspection template in the
global region.
Click Create new inspection template .
Optional: To modify the default selection of infoTypes, click Manage infoTypes .
For more information about how to manage built-in and custom infoTypes, see
Manage infoTypes through the
Google Cloud console .
You must have at least one infoType selected to continue.
Optional: Configure the inspection template further by adding rulesets
and setting a confidence threshold. For more information, see
Configure detection .
When Sensitive Data Protection creates the scan configuration, it stores this
new inspection template in the global region.
Option 2: Use an existing inspection template
Choose this option if you have existing inspection templates that you
want to use.
Click Select existing inspection template .
Enter the full resource name of the inspection template that you want to use.
The Region field is automatically populated with the name of the region
where your inspection template is stored.
The inspection template that you enter must be in the same region as the data
to be profiled.
To respect data residency, Sensitive Data Protection doesn't
use an inspection template outside the region where that template is stored.
To find the full resource name of an inspection template, follow these
steps:
Go to your inspection templates list. This page opens on a separate tab.
Go to inspection templates
Select the project that contains the inspection template that you want to
use.
Select Configuration > Templates > Inspect ,
and then click the template ID of the template that you want to use.
On the page that opens, copy the full resource name of the template. The
full resource name follows this format:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ REGION /inspectTemplates/ TEMPLATE_ID
On the Create scan configuration page, in the Template name
field, paste the full resource name of the template.
To add an inspection template for another region, click Add inspection
template and enter the template's full resource name. Repeat this for each
region where you have a dedicated inspection template.
Optional: Add an inspection template that's stored in the global region.
Sensitive Data Protection automatically uses that template for data in regions
where you don't have a dedicated inspection template.
Caution: If you don't include an inspection template that's stored in the
global region, Sensitive Data Protection can't profile data in regions that
don't have a dedicated inspection template. For more information, see
Data residency considerations .
Add actions
This section describes how to specify actions that you want
Sensitive Data Protection to take after profiling a table. These actions
are useful if you want to send insights gathered from data profiles to other
Google Cloud services.
Note: For information about how other Google Cloud services may charge you
for configuring actions, see Pricing for exporting data
profiles .
Publish to Google Security Operations
Metrics gathered from data
profiles can add context to your Google Security Operations findings. The added
context can help you determine the most important security issues to address.
For example, if you're investigating a particular service agent,
Google Security Operations can determine what resources the service agent accessed
and whether any of those resources have high-sensitivity data.
To send your data profiles to your Google Security Operations instance, turn on
Publish to Google Security Operations .
If you don't have a Google Security Operations instance enabled for your
organization—through the standalone
product or
through Security Command Center
Enterprise —turning on this option has no
effect.
Publish to Security Command Center
Findings from data profiles provide context when you triage and develop response
plans for your vulnerability and threat findings in
Security Command Center .
Note: You can also configure Security Command Center to
automatically prioritize resources for the attack path simulation
feature according to
the calculated sensitivity of the data that the resources contain. For more
information, see Set resource priority values automatically by data
sensitivity .
Before you can use this action, Security Command Center must be activated at the
organization level. Turning on Security Command Center at the organization level
enables the flow of findings from integrated services like
Sensitive Data Protection. Sensitive Data Protection works with
Security Command Center in all service tiers.
If Security Command Center isn't activated at the organization level,
Sensitive Data Protection findings won't appear in
Security Command Center. For more information, see Check the activation level of
Security Command Center .
To send the results of your data profiles to Security Command Center, make sure the
Publish to Security Command Center option is turned on.
For more information, see Publish data profiles to
Security Command Center .
Save data profile copies to BigQuery
Sensitive Data Protection saves a copy of each generated data profile
in a BigQuery table. If you don't provide the details of your
preferred table, Sensitive Data Protection creates a dataset and table in the
service agent container.
By default, the dataset is named sensitive_data_protection_discovery and
the table is named discovery_profiles .
Important: The output table uses
DataProfileBigQueryRowSchema
as its schema. This schema can change as Sensitive Data Protection adds
features. Make sure that your workflows can handle schema changes, for example,
by ignoring unknown fields.
This action lets you keep a history of all of your generated profiles. This
history can be useful for creating audit reports and visualizing data
profiles . You can also
load this information into other systems.
Also, this option lets you see all of your data profiles in a single view,
regardless of which region your data resides in. Although you can also view the
data profiles through the
Google Cloud console , the
console displays the profiles in only one region at a time.
When Sensitive Data Protection fails to profile a table, it periodically
retries. To minimize noise in the exported data, Sensitive Data Protection
exports only the successfully generated profiles to BigQuery.
Sensitive Data Protection starts exporting profiles from the time you turn on
this option. Profiles that were generated before you turned on exporting aren't
saved to BigQuery.
Note: Your service agent must
have write access on the table where the profile copies will be saved. If you
don't have a service agent yet, Sensitive Data Protection lets you create one
later in the Create scan configuration page.
For example queries that you can use when analyzing data profiles,
see Analyze data profiles .
Save sample discovery findings to BigQuery
Sensitive Data Protection can add sample findings to a
BigQuery table of your choice. Sample findings represent a subset
of all findings and might not represent all infoTypes that were discovered.
Normally, the system generates around 10 sample findings per table, but
this number can vary for each discovery run.
Each finding includes the actual string (also called quote ) that was detected
and its exact location.
This action is useful if you want to evaluate whether your inspection
configuration is correctly
matching the type of information that you want to flag as sensitive. Using the
exported data profiles and the exported sample findings, you can run
queries to get more information about the specific items that were flagged, the
infoTypes they matched, their exact locations, their calculated sensitivity
levels, and other details.
Important: The output table uses
DataProfileFinding
as its schema. This schema can change as Sensitive Data Protection adds
features. Make sure that your workflows can handle schema changes, for example,
by ignoring unknown fields.
Example query: Show sample findings related
to table data profiles
This example requires both Save data profile copies to BigQuery and
Save sample discovery findings to BigQuery to be enabled.
The following query uses an INNER JOIN operation on both
the table of exported data profiles and the table of exported sample findings. In the resulting
table, each record shows the finding's quote, the infoType that it matched, the resource that
contains the finding, and the calculated sensitivity level of the resource.
SELECT
findings_table . quote ,
findings_table . infotype . name ,
findings_table . location . container_name ,
findings_table . location . data_profile_finding_record_location . field . name AS field_name ,
profiles_table . table_profile . dataset_project_id AS project_id ,
profiles_table . table_profile . dataset_id AS dataset_id ,
profiles_table . table_profile . table_id AS table_id ,
profiles_table . table_profile . sensitivity_score AS table_sensitivity_score
FROM
` FINDINGS_TABLE_PROJECT_ID . FINDINGS_TABLE_DATASET_ID . FINDINGS_TABLE_ID _latest_v1 ` AS findings_table
INNER JOIN
` PROFILES_TABLE_PROJECT_ID . PROFILES_TABLE_DATASET_ID . PROFILES_TABLE_ID _latest_v1 ` AS profiles_table
ON
findings_table . data_profile_resource_name = profiles_table . table_profile . name
To save sample findings to a BigQuery table, follow these
steps:
Turn on Save sample discovery findings to BigQuery .
Enter the details of the BigQuery
table where you want to save the sample findings.
The table that you specify for this action must be different from the
table used for the Save data profile copies to BigQuery action.
For Project ID , enter the ID of an existing project where you want
to export the findings to.
For Dataset ID , enter the name of an existing dataset in the project.
For Table ID , enter the name of the BigQuery table where
want to save the findings to. If this table doesn't exist,
Sensitive Data Protection automatically creates it for you using the name
that you provide.
Note: Your service agent must
have write access on the table. If you don't have a
service agent yet, Sensitive Data Protection lets you create one later in the
Create scan configuration page.
For information about the contents of each finding that is saved in the
BigQuery table, see
DataProfileFinding .
Attach tags to resources
Turning on Attach tags to resources instructs
Sensitive Data Protection to automatically tag your data according to its
calculated sensitivity level. This section requires you to first complete the
tasks in Control IAM access to resources based on data
sensitivity .
To automatically tag a resource according to its calculated sensitivity level,
follow these steps:
Turn on the Tag resources option.
For each sensitivity level (high, moderate, low, and unknown), enter the
path of the tag value that you created for the given sensitivity level.
If you skip a sensitivity level, no tag is attached for it.
To automatically lower the data risk level of a
resource when the sensitivity level tag is present, select When a tag is
applied to a resource, lower the data risk of its profile to LOW . This
option helps you measure the improvement in your data security and privacy
posture.
Important: This option overrides the calculated data risk
level
of the profiled resource.
Select one or both of the following options:
Tag a resource when it is profiled for the first time.
Tag a resource when its profile is updated. Select
this option if you want Sensitive Data Protection to overwrite the
sensitivity level tag value on succeeding discovery runs. Consequently, a
principal's access to a resource changes automatically as the calculated
data sensitivity level for that resource increases or decreases.
Don't select this option if you plan to manually update the sensitivity
level tag values that the discovery service attached to your resources.
If you select this option, Sensitive Data Protection can overwrite
your manual updates.
Publish to Pub/Sub
Turning on Publish to Pub/Sub lets you take programmatic
actions based on profiling results. You can use Pub/Sub
notifications to develop a workflow for catching and remediating findings
with significant data risk or sensitivity.
To send notifications to a Pub/Sub topic, follow these steps:
Turn on Publish to Pub/Sub .
A list of options appears. Each option describes an event that causes
Sensitive Data Protection to send a notification to Pub/Sub.
Select the events that should trigger a Pub/Sub notification.
If you select Send a Pub/Sub notification each time a profile is updated ,
Sensitive Data Protection sends a notification when there's a change in the
sensitivity level, data risk level, detected infoTypes, public access, and
other important metrics in the
profile.
For each event you select, follow these steps:
Enter the name of the topic. The name must be in the following format:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /topics/ TOPIC_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project associated with the
Pub/Sub topic.
TOPIC_ID : the ID of the Pub/Sub topic.
Specify whether to include the full table profile in the
notification, or just the full resource name of the table that
was profiled.
Set the minimum data risk and sensitivity levels that must be met for
Sensitive Data Protection to send a notification.
Specify whether only one or both of the data risk and sensitivity
conditions must be met. For example, if you choose AND , then
both the data risk and the sensitivity conditions must be
met before Sensitive Data Protection sends a notification.
Note: Your service agent must have
publishing access on the Pub/Sub topic. An example of a role
that has publishing access is the Pub/Sub Publisher role
( roles/pubsub.publisher ). If you don't have a service agent yet,
Sensitive Data Protection lets you create one later in the Create scan
configuration page.
If there are configuration or permission issues with the Pub/Sub topic,
Sensitive Data Protection retries sending the Pub/Sub notification for up to
two weeks. After two weeks, the notification is discarded.
Send to Knowledge Catalog as aspects
This action lets you add
Knowledge Catalog aspects
to profiled tables based on insights from data profiles.
This action is only applied to new and updated profiles.
Existing profiles that aren't updated aren't sent to Knowledge Catalog.
When you enable this action, Sensitive Data Protection attaches the
Sensitive Data Protection profile aspect to the Knowledge Catalog
entry for each new or updated
table that you profile. The generated aspects contain insights gathered
from the data profiles. You can then search your organization and projects for
entries with specific Sensitive Data Protection profile aspect values.
To send the data profiles to Knowledge Catalog, make sure that the
Send to Dataplex Catalog as aspects option is turned on.
For more information, see Add Knowledge Catalog aspects based
on insights from data profiles .
Manage service agent container and billing
In this section, you specify the project
to use as a service agent container .
You can have Sensitive Data Protection automatically create a new project,
or you can choose an existing project.
Regardless of whether you're using a newly created service agent or reusing an
existing one, make sure it has read access to the data to be profiled.
Automatically create a project
If you don't have the permissions needed to create a project in the
organization, you need to select an existing project instead
or obtain the required permissions. For information about the required
permissions, see Roles required to work with data profiles at the organization
or folder
level .
To automatically create a project to use as your service agent container,
follow these steps:
In the Service agent container field, review the suggested project ID and
edit it as needed.
Click Create .
Optional: Update the default project name.
Select the account to bill for all billable operations related to this new
project, including operations that aren't related to discovery.
Note: If you already have an organization-level discovery
subscription ,
this billing account is still required to create the project. However, for
all discovery operations, you are billed through the project associated with
your subscription.
Click Create .
Sensitive Data Protection creates the new project. The service agent within
this project will be used to authenticate to Sensitive Data Protection and
other APIs.
Select an existing project
To select an existing project as your service agent container, click the
Service agent container field and select the project.
Set location to store configuration
Click the Resource location list, and select the region where you
want to store this scan configuration. All scan configurations that you
later create will also be stored in this location.
Where you choose to store your scan configuration doesn't affect the data to be
scanned. Your data
is scanned in the same region where that data is stored. For more information,
see Data residency considerations .
Note: If you already have an existing scan configuration, you can't change the value
set in this field. All scan configurations are stored in the same location.
If you want to change the location of all your scan configurations, you must
delete them,
recreate them, and store them in the new location.
Review and create
If you want to make sure that profiling doesn't start automatically after you
create the scan configuration, select Create scan in paused mode .
This option is useful in the following cases:
Your Google Cloud administrator still needs to grant data
profiling access to the service agent.
You want to create multiple scan configurations and you
want some configurations to override
others.
You opted to save data profiles to BigQuery and you want
to make sure the service agent has write access to the
BigQuery table where the data profile copies will be
saved.
You opted to save sample discovery findings to BigQuery
and you want to make sure that the service agent has write access to the
BigQuery table where the sample findings will be saved.
You configured Pub/Sub notifications and you want to grant publishing access to
the service agent.
You enabled the Attach tags to resources action and you need to
grant
the service agent access to the sensitivity level tag .
Review your settings and click Create .
Sensitive Data Protection creates the scan configuration and adds it to the
discovery scan configurations list.
To view or manage your scan
configurations, see Manage scan
configurations .
Sensitive Data Protection starts identifying your Cloud SQL
instances and creating a default connection for each instance. Depending on the
number of instances in scope of discovery, this process can take a few hours.
You can exit the Google Cloud console and check your connections later.
When the default connections are ready, update those connections with the
database user credentials that you want Sensitive Data Protection to use to
profile your Cloud SQL instances. For more information, see Manage
connections for use with
discovery .
Note:
We regularly improve our detection algorithm. If we find that your organization
or project would benefit from a new improvement that we implement, we might
automatically regenerate your data profiles and redo the actions in your scan
configuration . You won't incur Sensitive Data Protection charges for this
operation. However, because we will redo the actions, you might incur charges
for your use of other Google Cloud services. For example, if you configured
Sensitive Data Protection to save the data profiles to BigQuery, you
might incur BigQuery charges.
