Column data profiles
Each column data profile has the following fields:
Insights
Column data profiles provide the following insights:
Data risk
Level of risk associated with the data at its current state. For more
information, see Sensitivity and data risk levels .
Sensitivity
Score indicating the sensitivity level for this column. For more information,
see Sensitivity and data risk levels .
Predicted infoType
If a single built-in or
custom infoType clearly predominates
over others in the column, Sensitive Data Protection sets this field to that
infoType. Otherwise, this field has no value.
To view a list of all infoTypes detected in the column, refer to
the Other infoTypes field.
Sensitive Data Protection scans for only the infoTypes that you specified in the
inspection template . Thus,
only those infoTypes can appear in the Predicted infoType field. For
example, if the column has email addresses, but you didn't include the
EMAIL_ADDRESS infoType detector in your inspection template, then this field
doesn't contain EMAIL_ADDRESS .
If the column data predominantly matches several closely related infoTypes
that belong to the same general category, Sensitive Data Protection
sets this field to the more general infoType. For example, if the column
predominantly has a mix of PASSPORT , AUSTRALIA_PASSPORT , and
CANADA_PASSPORT infoTypes, the Predicted infoType field is set to
PASSPORT . The Other infoTypes field shows the more specific infoTypes
and their estimated prevalence.
Other infoTypes
InfoTypes detected in the column that don't have a strong enough signal to be
considered that column's predicted infoType . In this document, see
Predicted infoType .
For data profiles generated after October 13, 2022, each infoType listed in
this field has an estimated prevalence . The estimated prevalence is an
approximate percentage of non-null rows in which the infoType was detected.
For example, suppose you have a column that has the following metrics:
Predicted infoType: FDA_CODE
Other infoTypes: PERSON_NAME (2%) , STREET_ADDRESS (1%)
In this example, there is a strong indication that the column contains FDA
codes. Sensitive Data Protection also determined that approximately 2% of
non-null rows in the column might contain person names and 1% might contain
street addresses.
Sensitive Data Protection scans for only the infoTypes that you specified in the
inspection template . Thus,
only those infoTypes can appear in the Other infoTypes field. For example,
if the column has email addresses, but you didn't include the EMAIL_ADDRESS
infoType detector in your inspection template, then this field doesn't contain
EMAIL_ADDRESS .
Estimated null proportion
Approximate proportion of null values in this column, categorized as high,
medium, low, or very low. This value is high if a large proportion of entries
in this column is null.
Estimated uniqueness
An estimate of how much of the data in this column is unique, categorized as
high, medium, or low. A high uniqueness level suggests that the column
contains distinct values. A high presence of unique values can indicate that
the column contains identifiers.
A low uniqueness level suggests that the column contains many common values
such as enums or boolean values.
If Sensitive Data Protection determines that there aren't enough rows
in the table for it to calculate this metric, this value is blank.
Free text score
The probability that this column contains freeform text. A value close to 1
indicates the column is likely to contain freeform or natural-language text.
Possible values range from 0 through 1.
A high free text score can increase a column's data risk and sensitivity
levels .

If you profiled a dual-region Cloud Storage
bucket , then this field lists the two
regions.
If you profiled a file store from another cloud provider, then this value is
the region where the cloud provider stores the file store.
Encryption
Whether encryption for this file store is managed by Google or by your
organization.
File store type
The source of the of data that was profiled—Cloud Storage,
Amazon S3, or Azure Blob Storage.

Parent ID
The resource that owns the data that was profiled.
If the data profile is for a Google Cloud resource, then this is the ID
of the project that contains the data.
If the data profile is for an Amazon S3 bucket, then this is the ID
of the AWS account that contains the bucket.
If the data profile is for an Azure Blob Storage container, then
this is the ID of the Azure subscription that contains the container.
Public
Whether this file store is available to all users or restricted to certain
users.
Resource labels
Labels that the file store had at the time the profile was generated.
Resource tags
Tags that the file store had at
the time the profile was generated.
Resource location
Region or multi-region that contains the file store.
If you profiled a dual-region Cloud Storage
bucket , then this value depends on
whether the bucket is stored in a predefined dual region:
For predefined dual regions ,
Sensitive Data Protection sets this value to the predefined dual-region
name.
For standard dual regions, Sensitive Data Protection sets this value to
the multi-region that contains the dual regions. For information about how
regions map to multi-regions, see Dual
regions .
Resource name
Fully qualified name of the data profile.
Status
Indication of whether the profile succeeded in generation.
File cluster summaries
When a file store data profile is generated, the files are grouped into file
clusters. Sensitive Data Protection provides a summary for each file cluster.
Each file cluster summary has the following fields:
