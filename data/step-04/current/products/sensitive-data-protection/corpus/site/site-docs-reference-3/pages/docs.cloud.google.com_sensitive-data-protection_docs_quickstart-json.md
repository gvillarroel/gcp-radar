Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the DLP API:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable dlp.googleapis.com
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/dlp.user
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.

Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/dlp.user
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Inspect a string for sensitive information
This section shows you how to configure the DLP API to scan
sample text using the projects.content.inspect
REST method.
This section requires you to save the sample request in a JSON file. If you're
using Cloud Shell, you can use the Cloud Shell Editor to create the
file. To launch the editor, click
edit Open Editor
launch on the toolbar of the Cloud Shell window.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID. Project IDs are
alphanumeric strings, like my-project .
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://dlp.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /content:inspect
Request JSON body:
{
"item": {
"value": "My phone number is (800) 555-0123."
},
"inspectConfig": {
"infoTypes": [
{
"name": "PHONE_NUMBER"
},
{
"name": "US_TOLLFREE_PHONE_NUMBER"
}
],
"minLikelihood": "POSSIBLE",
"limits": {
"maxFindingsPerItem": 0
},
"includeQuote": true
}
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named inspect-request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @inspect-request.json \ "https://dlp.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /content:inspect"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named inspect-request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile inspect-request.json ` -Uri "https://dlp.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT_ID /content:inspect" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"result": {
"findings": [
{
"quote": "(800) 555-0123",
"infoType": {
"name": "US_TOLLFREE_PHONE_NUMBER"
},
"likelihood": "LIKELY",
"location": {
"byteRange": {
"start": "19",
"end": "33"
},
"codepointRange": {
"start": "19",
"end": "33"
}
},
"createTime": "2022-09-23T01:53:05.303Z",
"findingId": "2022-09-23T01:53:05.306348Z5328915744504121862"
}
]
}
}
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, delete the Google Cloud project with the
resources.
Delete the project
If you created a new project for this quickstart, the easiest way to prevent
additional charges is to delete the project.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Revoke your credentials
Optional: Revoke credentials from the gcloud CLI.
gcloud auth revoke
