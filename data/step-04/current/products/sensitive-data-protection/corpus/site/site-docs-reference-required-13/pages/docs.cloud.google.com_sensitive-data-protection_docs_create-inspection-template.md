Create a Sensitive Data Protection inspection template
This quickstart shows you how to create and use a Sensitive Data Protection inspection
template in the Google Cloud console. Sensitive Data Protection inspection templates
let you create and persist configuration information in Sensitive Data Protection.
To complete this quickstart, you need to have data that you can scan in
Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Firestore in Datastore mode (Datastore).
To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the
Google Cloud console, click Guide me :

Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .

Enable the Sensitive Data Protection API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Create a template
In the following sections, you configure and create an inspection template.
Define template
In the Sensitive Data Protection section of the Google Cloud console, go
to the Create template page.
Go to Create template
On the Create template page, define the following options:
For Template type , use the default setting Inspect (find sensitive
data) .
For Template ID , enter quickstart-template .
For Display name , enter Quickstart template .
For Description , leave the field empty.
For Resource location , use the default setting Global (any
region) .
Click Continue .
Configure detection
You now configure the template to detect for an infoType such as credit card numbers.
In the Configure detection section of the Create template page, do
the following:
In the InfoTypes section, click Manage infoTypes , select the
infoTypes that you want to scan for, and then click Done .
In the Confidence threshold section, select Possible
from the Likelihood list.
The default value Possible is sufficient for most purposes. If
you routinely get matches that are too broad when you use this
template, move the slider up. If you get too few matches, move the
slider down.
To create the template, click Create .
The template's summary information page appears. To return to the main
Sensitive Data Protection page, click arrow_back
Inspection template details .
Use the template
The following steps describe how to configure the template for use in a scan:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create job or job trigger
page.
Go to Create job or job trigger
Follow the prompts to create an inspection job or job trigger (a recurring
job). When you are prompted to configure the detection, select the template
that you created.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, follow these steps.
Delete the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Delete the template
There are no costs associated with creating and storing templates. However, if
you want to delete a template, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Configuration tab of
Sensitive Data Protection.
Go to Configuration
Select the project that contains the inspection template that you want to
delete.
On the Configuration tab, click the Templates subtab. The
Google Cloud console displays a list of all templates for the current
project.
In the Actions column for the template you want to delete, click the
trigger actions menu ( more_vert ) ,
click Delete , and then click Confirm .
