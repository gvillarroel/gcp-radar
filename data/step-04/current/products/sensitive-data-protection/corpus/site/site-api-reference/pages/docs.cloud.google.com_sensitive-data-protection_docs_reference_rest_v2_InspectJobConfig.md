"bytesLimitPerFilePercent" : integer ,
"fileTypes" : [
enum ( FileType )
] ,
"sampleMethod" : enum ( SampleMethod ) ,
"filesLimitPercent" : integer
}
Fields
fileSet
object ( FileSet )
The set of one or more files to scan.
bytesLimitPerFile
string ( int64 format)
Max number of bytes to scan from a file. If a scanned file's size is bigger than this value then the rest of the bytes are omitted. Only one of bytesLimitPerFile and bytesLimitPerFilePercent can be specified. This field can't be set if de-identification is requested. For certain file types, setting this field has no effect. For more information, see Limits on bytes scanned per file .
bytesLimitPerFilePercent
integer
Max percentage of bytes to scan from a file. The rest are omitted. The number of bytes scanned is rounded down. Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit. Defaults to 0. Only one of bytesLimitPerFile and bytesLimitPerFilePercent can be specified. This field can't be set if de-identification is requested. For certain file types, setting this field has no effect. For more information, see Limits on bytes scanned per file .
fileTypes[]
enum ( FileType )
List of file type groups to include in the scan. If empty, all files are scanned and available data format processors are applied. In addition, the binary content of the selected files is always scanned as well. Images are scanned only as binary if the specified region does not support image inspection and no fileTypes were specified. Image inspection is restricted to 'global', 'us', 'asia', and 'europe'.
sampleMethod
enum ( SampleMethod )
How to sample the data.
filesLimitPercent
integer
Limits the number of files to scan to this percentage of the input FileSet. Number of files scanned is rounded down. Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit. Defaults to 0.
FileSet
Set of files to scan.
JSON representation
{
"url" : string ,
"regexFileSet" : {
object ( CloudStorageRegexFileSet )
}
}
Fields
url
string
The Cloud Storage url of the file(s) to scan, in the format gs://<bucket>/<path> . Trailing wildcard in the path is allowed.
If the url ends in a trailing slash, the bucket or directory represented by the url will be scanned non-recursively (content in sub-directories will not be scanned). This means that gs://mybucket/ is equivalent to gs://mybucket/* , and gs://mybucket/directory/ is equivalent to gs://mybucket/directory/* .
Exactly one of url or regexFileSet must be set.
regexFileSet
object ( CloudStorageRegexFileSet )
The regex-filtered set of files to scan. Exactly one of url or regexFileSet must be set.
CloudStorageRegexFileSet
Message representing a set of files in a Cloud Storage bucket. Regular expressions are used to allow fine-grained control over which files in the bucket to include.
Included files are those that match at least one item in includeRegex and do not match any items in excludeRegex . Note that a file that matches items from both lists will not be included. For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e., everything in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular expression.
For example, given the input {bucketName: "mybucket", includeRegex:
["directory1/.*"], excludeRegex:
["directory1/excluded.*"]} :
gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile will be included
gs://mybucket/directory1/directory2/myfile will be included ( .* matches across / )
gs://mybucket/directory0/directory1/myfile will not be included (the full path doesn't match any items in includeRegex )
gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile will not be included (the path matches an item in excludeRegex )
If includeRegex is left empty, it will match all files by default (this is equivalent to setting includeRegex: [".*"] ).
Some other common use cases:
{bucketName: "mybucket", excludeRegex: [".*\.pdf"]} will include all files in mybucket except for .pdf files
{bucketName: "mybucket", includeRegex: ["directory/[^/]+"]} will include all files directly under gs://mybucket/directory/ , without matching across /
JSON representation
{
"bucketName" : string ,
"includeRegex" : [
string
] ,
"excludeRegex" : [
string
]
}
Fields
bucketName
string
The name of a Cloud Storage bucket. Required.
includeRegex[]
string
A list of regular expressions matching file paths to include. All files in the bucket that match at least one of these regular expressions will be included in the set of files, except for those that also match an item in excludeRegex . Leaving this field empty will match all files by default (this is equivalent to including .* in the list).
Regular expressions use RE2 syntax ; a guide can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub.
excludeRegex[]
string
A list of regular expressions matching file paths to exclude. All files in the bucket that match at least one of these regular expressions will be excluded from the scan.
Regular expressions use RE2 syntax ; a guide can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub.
SampleMethod
How to sample bytes if not all bytes are scanned. Meaningful only when used in conjunction with bytesLimitPerFile. If not specified, scanning would start from the top.
Enums
SAMPLE_METHOD_UNSPECIFIED
No sampling.
TOP
Scan from the top (default).
RANDOM_START
For each file larger than bytesLimitPerFile, randomly pick the offset to start scanning. The scanned bytes are contiguous.
BigQueryOptions
Options defining BigQuery table and row identifiers.
JSON representation
{
"tableReference" : {
object ( BigQueryTable )
} ,
"identifyingFields" : [
{
object ( FieldId )
}
] ,
"rowsLimit" : string ,
"rowsLimitPercent" : integer ,
"sampleMethod" : enum ( SampleMethod ) ,
"excludedFields" : [
{
object ( FieldId )
}
] ,
"includedFields" : [
{
object ( FieldId )
}
]
}
Fields
tableReference
object ( BigQueryTable )
Complete BigQuery table reference.
identifyingFields[]
object ( FieldId )
Table fields that may uniquely identify a row within the table. When actions.saveFindings.outputConfig.table is specified, the values of columns specified here are available in the output table under location.content_locations.record_location.record_key.id_values . Nested fields such as person.birthdate.year are allowed.
rowsLimit
string ( int64 format)
Max number of rows to scan. If the table has more rows than this value, the rest of the rows are omitted. If not set, or if set to 0, all rows will be scanned. Only one of rowsLimit and rowsLimitPercent can be specified. Cannot be used in conjunction with TimespanConfig.
rowsLimitPercent
integer
Max percentage of rows to scan. The rest are omitted. The number of rows scanned is rounded down. Must be between 0 and 100, inclusively. Both 0 and 100 means no limit. Defaults to 0. Only one of rowsLimit and rowsLimitPercent can be specified. Cannot be used in conjunction with TimespanConfig.
Caution: A known issue is causing the rowsLimitPercent field to behave unexpectedly. We recommend using rowsLimit instead.
sampleMethod
enum ( SampleMethod )
How to sample the data.
excludedFields[]
object ( FieldId )
References to fields excluded from scanning. This allows you to skip inspection of entire columns which you know have no findings. When inspecting a table, we recommend that you inspect all columns. Otherwise, findings might be affected because hints from excluded columns will not be used.
includedFields[]
object ( FieldId )
Limit scanning only to these fields. When inspecting a table, we recommend that you inspect all columns. Otherwise, findings might be affected because hints from excluded columns will not be used.
SampleMethod
How to sample rows if not all rows are scanned. Meaningful only when used in conjunction with either rowsLimit or rowsLimitPercent. If not specified, rows are scanned in the order BigQuery reads them.
Enums
SAMPLE_METHOD_UNSPECIFIED
No sampling.
TOP
Scan groups of rows in the order BigQuery provides (default). Multiple groups of rows may be scanned in parallel, so results may not appear in the same order the rows are read.
RANDOM_START
Randomly pick groups of rows to scan.
HybridOptions

Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression ([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)? .
No more than 10 labels can be associated with a given finding.
Examples:
"environment" : "production"
"pipeline" : "etl"
An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" } .
tableOptions

JSON representation
{
"identifyingFields" : [
{
object ( FieldId )
}
]
}
Fields
identifyingFields[]
object ( FieldId )

JSON representation
{
"startTime" : string ,
"endTime" : string ,
"timestampField" : {
object ( FieldId )
} ,
"enableAutoPopulationOfTimespanConfig" : boolean
}
Fields
startTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Exclude files, tables, or rows older than this value. If not set, no lower time limit is applied.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
endTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Exclude files, tables, or rows newer than this value. If not set, no upper time limit is applied.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
timestampField
object ( FieldId )
Specification of the field containing the timestamp of scanned items. Used for data sources like Datastore and BigQuery.
For BigQuery
If this value is not specified and the table was modified between the given start and end times, the entire table will be scanned. If this value is specified, then rows are filtered based on the given start and end times. Rows with a NULL value in the provided BigQuery column are skipped. Valid data types of the provided BigQuery column are: INTEGER , DATE , TIMESTAMP , and DATETIME .
If your BigQuery table is partitioned at ingestion time , you can use any of the following pseudo-columns as your timestamp field. When used with Cloud DLP, these pseudo-column names are case sensitive.
_PARTITIONTIME
_PARTITIONDATE
_PARTITION_LOAD_TIME
For Datastore
If this value is specified, then entities are filtered based on the given start and end times. If an entity does not contain the provided timestamp property or contains empty or invalid values, then it is included. Valid data types of the provided timestamp property are: TIMESTAMP .
See the known issue related to this operation.
enableAutoPopulationOfTimespanConfig
boolean
When the job is started by a JobTrigger we will automatically figure out a valid startTime to avoid scanning files that have not been modified since the last time the JobTrigger executed. This will be based on the time of the execution of the last run of the JobTrigger or the timespan endTime used in the last run of the JobTrigger.
For BigQuery
Inspect jobs triggered by automatic population will scan data that is at least three hours old when the job starts. This is because streaming buffer rows are not read during inspection and reading up to the current timestamp will result in skipped rows.
See the known issue related to this operation.
