Analyze data profiles stored in BigQuery
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
If you configured the sensitive data discovery service to
send all successfully generated data profiles to
BigQuery, you can query those data profiles to gain insights about
your data. You can also use visualization tools like
Looker Studio to build custom reports tailored to your business needs.
Alternatively, you can use a premade report that Sensitive Data Protection
provides, tune it, and share it as needed.
This page provides example SQL queries that you can use to learn more about your
data profiles. It also shows you how you can visualize data profiles in
in Looker Studio.
For more information on data profiles, see
Overview of sensitive data discovery .
Before you begin
This page assumes that you have configured profiling at the organization,
folder, or project level. In your discovery scan configuration, make sure that
the Save data profile copies to BigQuery action is enabled. For more
information about how to create a discovery scan configuration, see Create a
scan
configuration .
The output table
In this document, the table that contains the exported data
profiles is called the output table .
Important: The output table uses
DataProfileBigQueryRowSchema
as its schema. This schema can change as Sensitive Data Protection adds
features. Make sure that your workflows can handle schema changes, for example,
by ignoring unknown fields.
Make sure you have the project ID, dataset ID, and table ID of the output
table readily available. You need them to perform the procedures on this page.
The latest view
When Sensitive Data Protection exports data profiles to your output table, it
also creates the latest view . This view is a
prefiltered virtual table that includes only the latest snapshots of your data
profiles. The latest view has the same schema as the output table, so you can
use the two interchangeably in your SQL queries and Looker Studio
reports. The results can differ because the output table contains older
snapshots of the data profiles.
The latest view is stored in the same location as the output table. Its name
has the following format:
OUTPUT_TABLE _latest_ VERSION
Replace the following:
OUTPUT_TABLE : the ID of the table that contains the exported data
profiles.
VERSION : the version number of the view.
For example, if your output table's name is table-profile , then the latest
view has a name like table-profile_latest_v1 .
When using the latest view in SQL queries, use the view's full name, which
includes the project ID, dataset ID, table ID, and suffix—for example,
myproject.mydataset.table-profile_latest_v1 .
PROJECT_ID . DATASET_ID . OUTPUT_TABLE _latest_ VERSION
Note: Sensitive Data Protection automatically creates the view. To avoid failures
when loading data into the Looker Studio, don't edit or delete
the view.
Choose between the output table and the latest view
The latest view includes only the latest data profile snapshots, while the
output table has all data profile snapshots, including snapshots that are
outdated. For example, a query on the output table can return multiple
column data profiles
for the same column—one for each time that column was profiled.
When choosing between using the output table and the latest
view in your SQL queries or Looker Studio reports, consider the
following:
The latest view is useful if you have data assets that have been reprofiled
and you only want to see the latest profiles—not their earlier versions.
That is, you want to see the current state of your profiled data.
The output table is useful if you want to get a historical view of your
profiled data. For example, you're
trying to determine whether your organization has ever stored a particular
infoType, or you want to see the changes a particular data profile has
undergone.
Sample SQL queries
This section provides example queries that you can use when analyzing data
profiles. To run these queries, see
Running interactive queries .
In the following examples, replace TABLE_OR_VIEW with either of the
following:
The name of the output table, which is the table that contains the exported
data profiles—for example, myproject.mydataset.table-profile .
The name of the latest view of the output table—for
example, myproject.mydataset.table-profile_latest_v1 .
In either case, you must include the project ID and the dataset ID.
For more information, see
Choose between the output table and the latest view on this
page.
To troubleshoot any errors you encounter, see

Work with data profiles in Looker Studio
To visualize your data profiles in Looker Studio, you can use
a premade report, or you can create your own .
Use a premade report
Sensitive Data Protection provides a premade Looker Studio report
that highlights the rich insights of data profiles. The Sensitive Data
Protection Dashboard is a multi-page report that gives you a quick high-level
view of your data profiles, including breakdowns by risk, by infoType, and by
location. Explore the other tabs to see views by geographic region and posture
risk, or drill down to specific metrics. You can use this premade report as is,
or you can customize it as needed. This is the recommended version of the
premade report.
To view the premade report with your data, enter the required values in the
following URL. Then, copy the resulting URL to your browser.
https://lookerstudio.google.com/c/u/0/reporting/create?c.reportId=c9826374-e016-4c96-a495-7281328375c6&ds.connector=BIG_QUERY&ds.projectId= PROJECT_ID &ds.datasetId= DATASET_ID &ds.tableId= TABLE_OR_VIEW &ds.type=TABLE&ds.useFreshSchema=false
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project that contains the output table.
DATASET_ID : the dataset that contains the output table.
TABLE_OR_VIEW : either of the following:
The name of the output table, which is the table that contains the exported
data profiles—for example, myproject.mydataset.table-profile .
The name of the latest view of the output table—for
example, myproject.mydataset.table-profile_latest_v1 .
For more information, see
Choose between the output table and the latest view on
this page.
It can take a few minutes for Looker Studio to load the report
with your data. If you encounter errors or if the report doesn't load, see
Troubleshoot errors with the premade report on this page.
In the following example, the dashboard shows that low-sensitivity and
high-sensitivity data are present in multiple countries around the world.
Earlier version of the premade report
The first version of the premade report is still available at the following
address:
https://lookerstudio.google.com/c/u/0/reporting/create?c.reportId=907a2b73-ffe4-40b2-b9a1-c2aa0bbd69fd&ds.connector=BIG_QUERY&ds.projectId= PROJECT_ID &ds.datasetId= DATASET_ID &ds.tableId= TABLE_OR_VIEW &ds.type=TABLE&ds.useFreshSchema=false
Create a report
Looker Studio lets you
create interactive reports. In this section, you create a simple
table report in Looker Studio that is based on the data profiles
exported to your output table in BigQuery.
Make sure you have the
project ID, dataset ID, and table ID of the output table or the
latest view readily available. You need them to perform this
procedure.
This example shows you how to create a report containing a table that shows each
infoType reported in your data profiles and its
corresponding frequency.
In general, you incur BigQuery usage costs
when accessing BigQuery through Looker Studio.
For more information, see
Visualizing BigQuery data using Looker Studio .
To create a report, do the following:
Open
Looker Studio
and log in.
Click Blank Report .
On the Connect to data tab, click the BigQuery
card.
If prompted, authorize Looker Studio to access your
BigQuery projects.
Connect to your BigQuery data:
For Project , select the project that contains the output table. You
can search for the project in the Recent projects , My projects ,
and Shared projects tabs.
For Dataset , select the dataset that contains the output table.
For Table , select either the output table or the
latest view of the output table.
For more information, see
Choose between the output table and the latest view
on this page.
Click Add .
In the dialog that appears, click Add to report .
To add a table that shows each infoType reported and its
corresponding frequency (record count), follow these steps:
Click Add a chart .
Select a table style.
Click the area where you want to position the chart.
The chart appears in table format.
Resize the table as needed.
As long as the table is selected, its properties appear in the
Chart pane.
In the Chart pane, on the Setup tab, remove any preselected
dimensions and metrics.
For Dimension , add column_profile.column_info_type.info_type.name
or
file_store_profile.file_cluster_summaries.file_store_info_type_summaries.info_type.name .
These examples provide data at the column and file cluster levels. You
can try other dimensions as well. For example, you can use table-level
and bucket-level dimensions.
For Metric , add Record Count .
The resulting table looks similar to the following:
Learn more about tables in Looker Studio .
Troubleshoot errors with the premade report
If you see any errors, missing controls, or missing charts when loading the
premade report, make sure that the premade report is using the latest fields:
If your premade report is connected to the output table, confirm that this
table is attached to an active discovery scan configuration. To view the
settings of your scan configurations, see View a scan
configuration .
If your premade report is connected to the latest view, confirm that this
view is still present in BigQuery. If it is present, try making
a change to the view. Alternatively, make a copy of the view and connect the
premade report to that copy. For more information about the latest view, see
The latest
view on
this page.
If you continue to see errors after trying these steps, contact
Cloud Customer Care .
