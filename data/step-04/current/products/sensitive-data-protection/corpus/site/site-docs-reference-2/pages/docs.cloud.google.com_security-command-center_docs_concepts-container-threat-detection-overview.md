Container Threat Detection overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Premium and Enterprise service tiers
This page provides a high-level overview of Container Threat Detection concepts and features.
What is Container Threat Detection?
Container Threat Detection is a built-in service of Security Command Center that continuously
monitors the state of Container-Optimized OS
node images. The service evaluates all changes and remote access attempts to
detect runtime attacks in near-real time.
Container Threat Detection detects the most common container runtime attacks and alerts
you in Security Command Center and, optionally, in Cloud Logging. Container Threat Detection
includes several detection capabilities, including suspicious binaries and
libraries, and uses natural language processing (NLP) to detect malicious Bash
and Python code.
Container Threat Detection is available only with the Premium tier or Enterprise tier of
Security Command Center.
How Container Threat Detection works
Container Threat Detection detection instrumentation collects low-level behavior in the
guest kernel and executed scripts. The following is the execution path when
events are detected:
Container Threat Detection passes event information and information that identifies
the container through a user mode DaemonSet to a detector service for
analysis. Event collection is configured automatically when
Container Threat Detection is enabled.
The watcher DaemonSet passes container information in a best effort manner.
Container information can be dropped from the reported finding if the
Kubernetes and the container runtime fail to deliver the corresponding
container information in time.
The detector service analyzes events to determine whether an event is
indicative of an incident. The Bash and Python scripts are analyzed with NLP
to determine if the executed code is malicious.
If the detector service identifies an incident, the incident is written as a
finding in Security Command Center and, optionally, to Cloud Logging.
If the detector service doesn't identify an incident, then finding
information isn't stored.
All data in the kernel and detector service is ephemeral and isn't
persistently stored.
You can view finding details in the Security Command Center console and investigate
finding information. Your ability to view and edit findings is determined by the
roles you are granted. For more information on Security Command Center roles, see
Access control .
Considerations
Consider the following when using Container Threat Detection.
Security detection tools
Other security detection tools that are installed in your cluster can impair the
performance of Container Threat Detection and cause it to malfunction. We recommend that
you not have any other security detection tools installed in your cluster if the
cluster is already protected by Container Threat Detection.
File monitoring detectors
Container Threat Detection includes a number of detectors that monitor file
operations looking for access or modification to critical system files.
These detectors monitor file operations occurring on the node. Workloads with
significant file I/O, such as CI/CD systems, can potentially
suffer performance degradation when these detectors are enabled. To avoid any
unexpected impacts, these detectors are disabled by default. We recommend
that you evaluate the impact on any workload before enabling the file monitoring
detectors in production.

access to systems, escalate privileges, or move laterally within the
environment. Detecting such activity is critical to preventing
security breaches.
Findings are classified as Low severity.
This detector monitors for known commands used to locate private keys,
passwords, or credential files. The presence of such searches within a
containerized environment may suggest reconnaissance efforts or an
active compromise.
Defense Evasion: Base64 ELF File Command Line
BASE64_ELF_FILE_CMDLINE
A process was executed that contains an argument that
is an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file.
If an encoded ELF file execution is detected, it is a signal that
an attacker is trying to encode binary data for transfer to ASCII-only
command lines. Attackers can use this technique to evade
detection and run malicious code embedded in an ELF file.
Findings are classified as Medium severity.
This detection monitors process arguments that contain ELF
and are base64 encoded.

LAUNCH_CODE_COMPILER_TOOL_IN_CONTAINER
A process was initiated to launch a code compiler tool within the
container environment, indicating a potential attempt to build or
modify executable code in an isolated context.
Attackers might use code compilers within containers to develop
malicious payloads, inject code into existing binaries, or create
tools to bypass security controls, all while operating in a less
scrutinized environment to evade detection on the host system.
Findings are classified as Low severity.
This detector monitors for the execution of known code compiler tools
inside containers. The presence of such activity suggests a potential
effort to perform malicious code development or modification within the
container, possibly as a defense evasion tactic to tamper with system
components or client software.
Command and Control: Piped Encoded Download
PIPED_ENCODED_DOWNLOAD
The output of a network tool like curl or wget was
piped to a base64 --decode command.

payloads in a single step, potentially bypassing security measures
that only inspect the initial download command.
Findings are classified as Medium severity.
This detector monitors for network tool output being piped directly
to the base64 --decode command.
Command and Control: Piped Encoded Code Execution Detected
PIPED_ENCODED_CODE_EXECUTION
The output of base64 --decode command was piped directly
to a shell interpreter (e.g., python , bash ).
This is a strong indicator of malicious activity, where obfuscated
code is decoded and executed immediately without being written to
disk, evading file-based detection.
Findings are classified as High severity.
This detector monitors for the output of the
base64 --decode command being piped directly to
common interpreters.
Defense Evasion: Root Certificate Installed ( Preview )

may be trying to map out the infrastructure, identify vulnerabilities,
or collect data on system configurations to plan their next steps.
Findings are classified as Critical severity.
The detector monitors for known reconnaissance tools being executed
within the environment, identified through threat intelligence, which
can indicate preparation for more malicious activities.
Execution: Malicious Python executed
MALICIOUS_PYTHON_EXECUTED
A machine learning model identified the specified Python code as
malicious. Attackers can use Python to transfer tools or other files
from an external system into a compromised environment and execute
commands without binaries.
Note: If you enable data residency
for a specific location, then this detector can't be enabled and doesn't
generate findings in that location.
Findings are classified as Critical severity.
The detector uses NLP techniques to evaluate the content of executed
Python code. Because this approach is not based on signatures,
detectors can identify known and novel Python.
Execution: Modified Malicious Binary Executed
MODIFIED_MALICIOUS_BINARY_EXECUTED
A binary that meets the following conditions was executed:
Identified as malicious based on threat intelligence
Included in the original container image
Modified from the original container image during the runtime

This rule detects the footmatic-rip process executing
common shell programs, which may indicate that an attacker has
exploited CVE-2024-47076. The foomatic-rip is a part of
the OpenPrinting CUPS, an open source printing service that is a part
of many Linux distributions. Most container images have this printing
service disabled or removed. If this detection exists, please evaluate
whether this is intended behavior or disable the service immediately.
Findings are classified as Critical severity.
The detector looks for any shell process that is a child
process of the foomatic-rip process.
Execution: Possible Remote Command Execution Detected
POSSIBLE_REMOTE_COMMAND_EXECUTION_DETECTED
A process was detected spawning common UNIX commands through a network
socket connection, indicating a potential attempt to establish
unauthorized remote command execution capabilities.
Attackers frequently utilize techniques that mimic reverse shells to
gain interactive control over a compromised system, allowing them to
execute arbitrary commands remotely and bypass standard network
security measures like firewall restrictions. Detecting command
execution over a socket is a strong indicator of malicious remote
access.
Findings are classified as Medium severity.
This detector monitors for the creation of network sockets followed by
the execution of standard UNIX shell commands. This pattern suggests an
attempt to create a covert channel for remote command execution,
potentially enabling further malicious activities on the compromised
host.
Execution: Program Run with Disallowed HTTP Proxy Env
PROGRAM_RUN_WITH_DISALLOWED_HTTP_PROXY_ENV
A program was executed with an HTTP proxy environment variable that is
disallowed. This can indicate an attempt to bypass security controls,
redirect traffic for malicious purposes, or exfiltrate data through
unauthorized channels.

information, route traffic through malicious servers, or establish
covert communication channels. Detecting the execution of programs
with these environment variables is crucial for maintaining network
security and preventing data breaches.
Findings are classified as Low severity.
This detector monitors for the execution of programs with HTTP proxy
environment variables that are specifically disallowed. The use of
these proxies, particularly when unexpected, can signify malicious
activity and warrants immediate investigation.

The socat command has been used to create a reverse shell.
This rule detects the execution socat to create a reverse shell by
redirecting stdin, stdout, and stderr file descriptors.
This is a common technique used by attackers to gain remote access to
a compromised system.
Findings are classified as Medium severity.
The detector looks for any shell process that is the child
process of a socat process.
Execution: Suspicious Cron Modification ( Preview )
SUSPICIOUS_CRON_MODIFICATION
A cron configuration file was modified.
Modifications to cron jobs are a common tactic used by
attackers to establish persistent access to systems.
Attackers can leverage unauthorized changes to cron jobs to
execute malicious commands at specific intervals, enabling them
to maintain access and control over the system. Such modifications
may go unnoticed and allow attackers to carry out stealthy
activities over an extended period.
This is a file monitoring detector and has
specific GKE version requirements .
This detector monitors cron configuration files for
modifications.
Execution: Suspicious OpenSSL Shared Object Loaded
SUSPICIOUS_OPENSSL_SHARED_OBJECT_LOADED
OpenSSL has been executed to load a custom shared object.
Attackers may load custom libraries and replace existing libraries
used by OpenSSL in order to run malicious code. Its use in production
is uncommon and should warrant an immediate investigation.
Findings are classified as Critical severity.
This detector monitors for the execution of the
openssl engine command in order to load custom
.so files.
Exfiltration: Launch Remote File Copy Tools in Container
LAUNCH_REMOTE_FILE_COPY_TOOLS_IN_CONTAINER
A remote file copy tool execution was detected within the container,
indicating potential data exfiltration, lateral movement, or the
deployment of malicious payloads.
Attackers often use these tools to transfer sensitive data outside of
the container, move laterally within the network to compromise other
systems, or introduce malware for further malicious activities.
Detecting the use of remote file copy tools is crucial for preventing
data breaches, unauthorized access, and further compromise of the
container and potentially the host system.
Findings are classified as Low severity.
This detector monitors for the execution of known remote file copy tools
within the container environment. Their presence, especially when
unexpected, may indicate malicious activity.
Impact: Detect Malicious Cmdlines
DETECT_MALICIOUS_CMDLINES
A command was executed with arguments known to be potentially
destructive, such as attempts to delete critical system files or
modify password-related configurations.
Attackers may issue malicious command lines to cause system
instability, prevent recovery by deleting essential files, or gain
unauthorized access by manipulating user credentials. Detecting these
specific command patterns is critical to preventing significant system
impact.
Findings are classified as Critical severity.
This detector monitors for the execution of command-line arguments that
match patterns associated with system damage or privilege escalation.
The presence of such commands indicates a potential active attempt to
negatively impact the availability or security of the system.
Impact: Remove Bulk Data From Disk
REMOVE_BULK_DATA_FROM_DISK
A process was detected performing bulk data deletion operations,
which may indicate an attempt to erase evidence, disrupt services, or
execute a data-wiping attack within the container environment.
Attackers may remove large volumes of data to cover their tracks,
sabotage operations, or prepare for ransomware deployment. Detecting
such activity helps in identifying potential threats before critical
data loss occurs.
Findings are classified as Low severity.
The detector monitors for commands and processes associated with bulk
data deletion, or other data-wiping tools, to identify suspicious
activity that can compromise system integrity.
Impact: Suspicious crypto mining activity using the Stratum Protocol
SUSPICIOUS_CRYPTO_MINING_ACTIVITY_USING_STRATUM_PROTOCOL
A process was detected communicating over the Stratum protocol, which
is commonly used by cryptocurrency mining software. This activity
suggests potential unauthorized mining operations within the
container environment.
Attackers often deploy crypto miners to exploit system resources for
financial gain, leading to degraded performance, increased operational
costs, and potential security risks. Detecting such activity helps
mitigate resource abuse and unauthorized access.
Findings are classified as High severity.
This detector monitors for known Stratum protocol usage within the
environment. Because legitimate container workloads typically don't use
Stratum, its presence may indicate unauthorized mining operations or a
compromised container.
Malicious Script Executed
MALICIOUS_SCRIPT_EXECUTED
A machine learning model identified the specified Bash code as
malicious. Attackers can use Bash to transfer tools or other files
from an external system into a compromised environment and execute
commands without binaries.
Note: If you enable data residency
for a specific location, then this detector can't be enabled and doesn't
generate findings in that location.
Findings are classified as Critical severity.

service. If a URL is incorrectly classified as phishing or malware,
report it at
Reporting Incorrect Data .
Persistence: Modify ld.so.preload ( Preview )
MODIFY_LD_SO_PRELOAD
An attempt was made to modify the ld.so.preload file.
Changes to ld.so.preload can be
used by attackers to preload malicious shared libraries into
a system's library set. An attacker can use this to hijack the
execution flow by loading their own libraries during program
execution, potentially leading to privilege escalation or
evasion of defense mechanisms.
This is a file monitoring detector and has
specific GKE version requirements .
This detector monitors attempts to modify the ld.so.preload file.
Privilege Escalation: Abuse of Sudo For Privilege Escalation (CVE-2019-14287)

environment variable GCONV_PATH set.
Privilege Escalation: Sudo Potential Privilege Escalation (CVE-2021-3156)
SUDO_POTENTIAL_PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION
A non-root user has executed sudo or sudoedit
with a pattern of arguments that attempt to escalate privileges.
Detects an attempt to exploit a vulnerability affecting
sudo versions 1.9.5p2 and earlier. Executing sudo
or sudoedit with certain arguments, including one that
ends with a single backslash character, as an unprivileged user can
elevate the user's privileges to that of a root user.
Findings are classified as Critical severity.
The detector looks for any sudo or sudoedit
execution attempting to use arguments identified as a part of the
CVE-2021-4034 exploit.
Reverse Shell
REVERSE_SHELL
A process started with stream redirection to a remote connected
socket.
With a reverse shell, an attacker can communicate from a compromised
workload to an attacker-controlled machine. The attacker can then
command and control the workload—for example, as part of a
botnet.
Findings are classified as Critical severity.
The detector looks for stdin bound to a remote socket.
Unexpected Child Shell
UNEXPECTED_CHILD_SHELL
A process that does not normally invoke shells spawned a shell process.
Findings are classified as Critical severity.
The detector monitors all process executions. When a shell is invoked,
the detector generates a finding if the parent process is known to not
typically invoke shells.
