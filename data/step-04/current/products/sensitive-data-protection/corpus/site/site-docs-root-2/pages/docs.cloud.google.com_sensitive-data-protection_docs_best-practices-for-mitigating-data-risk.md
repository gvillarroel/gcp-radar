Recommended strategies for mitigating data risk
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides recommended strategies for identifying and remediating data
risk in your organization.
Protecting your data starts with understanding what data you are handling, where
sensitive data is located, and how this data is secured and used. When you have
a comprehensive view of your data and its security posture, you can take the
appropriate measures to protect it and continuously monitor for compliance and
risk.
This page assumes that you're familiar with the
discovery and inspection services and their
differences .
Enable sensitive data discovery
To determine where sensitive data exists in your business, configure
discovery at the organization, folder, or
project level. This service generates data profiles containing metrics and
insights about your data, including their
sensitivity levels and data risk levels.
As a service, discovery acts as a source of truth about your data
assets and can automatically report metrics for audit reports. Additionally,
discovery can connect to other Google Cloud services like
Security Command Center, Google Security Operations, and
Knowledge Catalog to enrich security operations and data management.
The discovery service runs continuously and detects new data as your
organization operates and grows. For example, if someone in your organization
creates a new project and uploads a large amount of new data, the
discovery service can discover, classify, and report on the new data
automatically.
Sensitive Data Protection provides a premade multi-page Looker
report that gives you a high-level
view of your data, including breakdowns by risk, by infoType, and by
location. In the following example, the report shows that low-sensitivity and
high-sensitivity data are present in multiple countries around the world.
Take action based on discovery results
After you gain a broad view of your data security posture, you can remediate any
issues found. In general, discovery findings fall into one of the following
scenarios:
Scenario 1: Sensitive data was found in a workload where it's expected and
it's properly protected.
Scenario 2: Sensitive data was found in a workload where it was not
expected or where it does not have proper controls in place.
Scenario 3: Sensitive data was found but needs more investigation.
Scenario 1: Sensitive data was found and is properly protected
Although this scenario doesn't require a specific action, you should include the
data profiles in your audit reports and security analysis workflows and continue
to monitor for changes that can put your data at risk.
We recommend doing the following:
Publish the data profiles to tools for monitoring your security posture and
investigating cyber threats. Data profiles can help you determine the severity
of a security threat or vulnerability that might put your sensitive data at
risk. You can automatically export data profiles to the following:
Security Command Center
Google SecOps
Publish the data profiles to Knowledge Catalog or an inventory system to track
the data profile metrics along with any other appropriate business metadata.
For information about automatically exporting data profiles to
Knowledge Catalog, see
Add Knowledge Catalog aspects based on insights from data profiles .
Scenario 2: Sensitive data was found and isn't properly protected
If discovery finds sensitive data in a resource that isn't properly
secured by access controls, then consider the recommendations described in this
section.
After you establish the correct controls and data security posture for
your data, monitor for any changes that can put your data at risk. See the
recommendations in scenario 1 .
General recommendations
Consider doing the following:
Make a de-identified copy of your
data to mask or
tokenize the sensitive columns so that your data analysts and engineers can
still work with your data without revealing raw, sensitive identifiers like
personally identifiable information (PII).
For Cloud Storage data, you can use a built-in feature in
Sensitive Data Protection to make de-identified
copies .
If you don't need the data, then consider deleting it.
Recommendations for protecting BigQuery data
Adjust table-level permissions using
IAM .
Set fine-grained column-level access controls by using BigQuery
policy tags to restrict access to
the sensitive and high-risk columns. This feature lets you protect those
columns while allowing access to the rest of the table.
You can also use policy tags to enable automatic data
masking , which can give users
partially obfuscated data.
Use the row-level security feature
of BigQuery to hide or display certain rows of data, depending
on whether a user or group is in an allowed list.
De-identify BigQuery data at query time with remote functions
(UDF) .
Recommendations for protecting Cloud Storage data
Apply access controls using
IAM .
Apply access controls using access control
lists .
Make de-identified copies of your Cloud Storage
data .
Scenario 3: Sensitive data was found but needs more investigation
In some cases, you might get results that require more investigation. For
example, a data profile might specify that a column has a high free-text score
with evidence of sensitive data. A high free-text score indicates that the data
doesn't have a predictable structure and might contain intermittent instances of
sensitive data. This might be a column of notes where certain rows contain PII,
such as names, contact details, or government-issued identifiers. In this case,
we recommend that you set additional access controls on the table and perform
other remediations described in scenario 2 . In
addition, we recommend running a deeper, targeted inspection to identify the
extent of the risk.
The inspection service lets you run a thorough scan of a single
resource, such as an individual BigQuery table or a Cloud Storage
bucket. For data sources that are not directly supported by the
inspection service, you can export the data into a Cloud Storage a
bucket or BigQuery table and run an inspection job on that
resource. For example, if you have data that you need to inspect in a
Cloud SQL database, you can export that data to a CSV or AVRO file in
Cloud Storage and run an inspection job.
An inspection job locates individual instances of sensitive data, such as a
credit card number in the middle of a sentence inside a table cell. This level
of detail can help you understand what kind of data is present in unstructured
columns or in data objects, including text files, PDFs, images, and other rich
document formats. You can then remediate your findings through any of the
recommendations described in scenario 2 .
In addition to the steps recommended in scenario 2, consider taking steps to
prevent sensitive information from entering your backend data storage.
The content methods
of the Cloud Data Loss Prevention API can accept data from any workload or application
for in-motion data inspection and masking. For example, your application can do
the following:
Accept a user-provided comment.
Run
content.deidentify
to de-identify any sensitive data from that string.
Save the de-identified string to your backend storage instead of the original
string.
Summary of best practices
The following table summarizes the best practices recommended in this document:
Challenge
Action
You want to know what kind of data your organization is storing.
Run discovery at the organization, folder, or project level.
You found sensitive data in a resource that is already protected.
Continuously monitor that resource by running discovery and
automatically exporting profiles to Security Command Center,
Google SecOps, and Knowledge Catalog.
You found sensitive data in a resource that isn't protected.
Hide or display data based on who is viewing it; use IAM,
column-level security, or row-level security. You can also use the
de-identification tools of Sensitive Data Protection to transform
or remove the sensitive elements.
You found sensitive data and you need to investigate further to understand
the extent of your data risk.
Run an inspection job on the resource. You can also proactively prevent
sensitive data from entering your backend storage by using the synchronous
content methods of the DLP API, which process data
in near real time.
