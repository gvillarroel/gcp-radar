CVE-2022-23606
GCP-2021-016
Published: 2021-08-24
Description
Severity
Notes
Istio contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request with a fragment (a section in the end of a URI that begins with a # character) in the URI path could bypass Istio’s URI path-based authorization policies.
For example, an Istio authorization policy denies requests sent to the URI path /user/profile . In the vulnerable versions, a request with the URI path /user/profile#section1 bypasses the deny policy and routes to the backend (with the normalized URI path /user/profile%23section1 ), which leads to a security incident.
This fix depends on a fix in Envoy, which is associated with CVE-2021-32779 .
What should I do?
Check if your clusters are impacted
Your cluster is impacted if both of the following are true:
It uses Cloud Service Mesh patch versions earlier than 1.7.8-asm.10, 1.8.6-asm.8, 1.9.8-asm.1, and 1.10.4-asm.6.
It uses authorization policies with DENY actions and operation.paths , or ALLOW actions and operation.notPaths .
Mitigation
Upgrade your cluster to one of the following patched versions:
1.10.4-asm.6
1.9.8-asm.1
1.8.6-asm.8
1.7.8-asm.10
With the new versions, the fragment part of the request’s URI is removed before the authorization and routing. This prevents a request with a fragment in its URI from bypassing authorization policies which are based on the URI without the fragment part.
Opt-out
If you opt-out of this new behavior, the fragment section in the URI is kept. To opt-out, you can configure your installation as follows:
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
metadata:
name: opt-out-fragment-cve-fix
namespace: istio-system
spec:
meshConfig:
defaultConfig:
proxyMetadata:
HTTP_STRIP_FRAGMENT_FROM_PATH_UNSAFE_IF_DISABLED: "false"
Note: Opting out of this behavior makes your cluster vulnerable to this CVE.

CVE-2021-39156
Description
Severity
Notes
Istio contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request could potentially bypass an Istio authorization policy when using rules based on hosts or notHosts .
In the vulnerable versions, the Istio authorization policy compares the HTTP Host or :authority headers in a case-sensitive manner, which is inconsistent with RFC 4343 . For example, the user could have an authorization policy that rejects requests with host secret.com , but the attacker can bypass this by sending the request at hostname Secret.com . The routing flow routes the traffic to the backend for secret.com , which causes a security incident.

CVE-2021-32780
GCP-2021-012
Published: 2021-06-24
Description
Severity
Notes
The Istio secure Gateway
or
workloads using the DestinationRule
can load TLS private keys and certificates from Kubernetes secrets via the credentialName
configuration. From Istio 1.8 and above, the secrets are read from istiod and
conveyed to gateways and workloads via XDS.
Normally, a gateway or workload deployment is only able to access TLS certificates and private
keys stored in the secret within its namespace. However, a bug in istiod allows a
client authorized to access the Istio XDS API to retrieve any TLS certificate and private keys
cached in istiod . This security vulnerability only impacts the 1.8 and 1.9 minor
releases of Cloud Service Mesh.
What should I do?
Check if your clusters are impacted
Your cluster is impacted if ALL of the following conditions are true:
It is using a 1.9.x version prior to 1.9.6-asm.1 or a 1.8.x prior to 1.8.6-asm.4.
It has defined Gateways
or DestinationRules
with the credentialName field specified.
It does not specify the istiod flag PILOT_ENABLE_XDS_CACHE=false .
Mitigation
Upgrade your cluster to one of the following patched versions:
1.9.6-asm.1
1.8.6-asm.4
If an upgrade isn't feasible, you can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling istiod caching.
You can disable caching by setting the istiod environment variable to
PILOT_ENABLE_XDS_CACHE=false . System and istiod performance could be
impacted because this disables XDS caching.

Notes
Istio contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an external client can access
unexpected services in the cluster, bypassing authorization checks, when a gateway is
configured with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH routing configuration.
What should I do?
Check if your clusters are impacted
This vulnerability impacts only usage of the AUTO_PASSTHROUGH Gateway type, which is
typically only used in multi-network, multi-cluster deployments.
Detect the TLS mode of all Gateways in the cluster with the following command:
kubectl get gateways.networking.istio.io -A -o \
"custom-columns=NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace, \
NAME:.metadata.name,TLS_MODE:.spec.servers[*].tls.mode"
If the output shows any AUTO_PASSTHROUGH Gateways, you could be impacted.
Mitigation
Update your clusters to the latest Cloud Service Mesh versions:
1.9.5-asm.2
1.8.6-asm.3
1.7.8-asm.8
* Note: The rollout of the Cloud Service Mesh
Managed Control Plane (available only
in 1.9.x versions) will complete in the next few days.

CVE-2021-31921
GCP-2021-007
Published: 2021-05-17
Description
Severity
Notes
Istio contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request path with multiple
slashes or escaped slash characters (%2F or %5C) could potentially bypass an Istio
authorization policy when path based authorization rules are used.
In a scenario where an Istio cluster administrator defines an authorization DENY policy to
reject the request at path "/admin" , a request sent to the URL path
"//admin" will NOT be rejected by the authorization policy.
According to the
RFC 3986 ,
the path "//admin" with multiple slashes should technically be treated as a
different path from the "/admin" . However, some backend services choose to
normalize the URL paths by merging multiple slashes to a single slash. This can result in a
bypass of the authorization policy ( "//admin" does not match
"/admin" ), and a user can access the resource at path "/admin" in
the backend.
What should I do?
Check if your clusters are impacted
Your cluster is impacted by this vulnerability if you have authorization policies using
"ALLOW action + notPaths field" or "DENY action + paths field" patterns. These patterns are
vulnerable to unexpected policy bypasses and you should upgrade to fix the security issue
ASAP.
The following is an example of vulnerable policy that uses "DENY action + paths field"
pattern:
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
name: deny-path-admin
spec:
action: DENY
rules:
- to:
- operation:
paths: ["/admin"]
The following is another example of vulnerable policy that uses "ALLOW action + notPaths
field" pattern:
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
name: allow-path-not-admin
spec:
action: ALLOW
rules:
- to:
- operation:
notPaths: ["/admin"]
Your cluster is not impacted by this vulnerability if:
You don't have authorization policies.
Your authorization policies don't define paths or notPaths fields.
Your authorization policies use "ALLOW action + paths field" or "DENY action + notPaths
field" patterns. These patterns could only cause unexpected rejection instead of policy
bypasses.
Upgrading is optional for these cases.
Mitigation
Update your clusters to the latest supported Cloud Service Mesh versions*. These versions support
configuring the Envoy proxies in the system with more normalization options:
1.9.5-asm.2
1.8.6-asm.3
1.7.8-asm.8
* Note: The rollout of the Cloud Service Mesh
Managed Control Plane (available only
in 1.9.x versions) will complete in the next few days.
Follow the
Istio security best practices guide
to configure your authorization policies.
