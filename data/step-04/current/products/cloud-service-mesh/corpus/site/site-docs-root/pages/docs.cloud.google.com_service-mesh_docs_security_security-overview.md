Cloud Service Mesh security overview
Note: This guide only supports Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs and does
not support Google Cloud APIs. For more information see,
Cloud Service Mesh overview .
Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs security helps you mitigate insider threats
and reduce the risk of a data breach by ensuring that all communications
between workloads are encrypted, mutually authenticated, and authorized.
Traditionally, micro-segmentation that uses IP-based rules has been used to
mitigate insider risks. However, the adoption of containers, shared services,
and distributed production environments spread across multiple clouds makes this
approach harder to configure and even harder to maintain.
With Cloud Service Mesh, you can configure a layer of service
context-aware and request context-aware network security that is independent
of the security of the underlying network. Because of this,
Cloud Service Mesh lets you adopt a defense-in-depth posture that is
consistent with Zero Trust security principles. It lets you achieve this
posture through declarative policies and without modifying any application code.
mutual TLS
Cloud Service Mesh uses mutual TLS (mTLS) for peer authentication.
Authentication refers to identity: who is this service? who is this end-user?
and can I trust that they are who they say they are?
mTLS makes it possible for workloads to verify each other's identities and
authenticate with each other. You might be familiar with simple TLS through its
use in HTTPS to allow browsers to trust web servers and to encrypt the data that
is exchanged. When simple TLS is used, the client establishes that the server
can be trusted by validating its certificate. mTLS is an implementation of TLS
in which both client and server present certificates to each other and verify
each other's identities.
mTLS is the means by which Cloud Service Mesh implements both
authentication and encryption between services.
In Cloud Service Mesh, auto mTLS is enabled by default. With auto mTLS, a
client sidecar proxy automatically detects if the server has a sidecar. The
client sidecar sends mTLS to workloads with sidecars and sends plain text to
workloads without sidecars. Note, however, services accept both plain-text and
mTLS traffic. To secure your service mesh, we recommend that you migrate your
services to only accept mTLS traffic.
For more information on enforcing only mTLS, see
Cloud Service Mesh by example: mTLS .
Security benefits
Cloud Service Mesh provides the following security benefits:
Mitigates risk of replay or impersonation attacks that use stolen
credentials. Cloud Service Mesh relies on mTLS certificates to
authenticate peers, rather than bearer tokens such as
JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Because mTLS certificates are bound to the TLS channel, it is not possible for
an entity within your production environment to impersonate another by
replaying the authentication token without access to the private keys.
Ensures encryption in transit. Using mTLS for authentication also ensures
that all TCP communications are encrypted in transit.
Ensures that only authorized clients can access a service with sensitive
data. Only authorized clients can access a service with sensitive data
irrespective of the network location of the client and the application-level
credentials. You can specify that only clients with authorized service
identities or in authorized Kubernetes namespaces can access a service. You
can also use IP-based access policies to grant access to clients deployed
outside the clients outside the mesh.
Mitigates the risk of user data breach within your production network. You
can ensure that insiders can only access sensitive data through authorized
clients. Furthermore, you can ensure that certain clients can only gain access
to user data if the client can present a valid and short-lived user token.
This mitigates the risk that the compromise of a single client credential
grants an attacker access to all user data.
Identifies which clients accessed a service with sensitive data.
Cloud Service Mesh access logging captures the mTLS identity of the
client in addition to the IP address. Thus, you can understand which workload
accessed a service even if the workload is ephemeral and dynamically
deployed, and in a different cluster or Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.
Features
This section describes the features that Cloud Service Mesh provides to
realize its security benefits.
Automatic certificate and key rotation
Using mTLS based on service identities makes it possible to encrypt all TCP
communications and provides a more secure non-replayable credential for access
control. One of the key challenges of using mTLS at scale is managing the keys
and certificates for all target workloads. Cloud Service Mesh takes care of
rotating mTLS keys and certificates for mesh workloads without disrupting
communications. Configuration of smaller cert refresh intervals is possible to
reduce risk.
Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority
Cloud Service Mesh includes a managed multi-regional private
certificate authority, Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority , for issuing certificates for
mTLS. Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority is a highly reliable and scalable service that
is optimized for dynamically scaled workloads on a cloud platform. With
Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, Google manages the security and availability of the
CA backend. Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority lets you rely on a single root of trust
across clusters. When using Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, you can rely on workload
identity pools to provide coarse-grained isolation. By default, authentication
fails if the client and the server are not in the same workload identity pool.
Certificates from Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority include the following data about
your application's services:
The Google Cloud project ID
The GKE namespace
The GKE service account name
Important: The certificates issued by Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority should only be
used to enable secure service-to-service communication within your service mesh,
and not be used for any other purpose. These certificates are sent whenever
services attempt to communicate with each other using mutual TLS. Make sure that
you don't inadvertently expose confidential information by using these
certificates when communicating outside your service mesh.
Certificate Authority Service
As an alternative to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, you can configure
Cloud Service Mesh to use Certificate Authority Service, which is suitable for
the following use cases:
If you need different certificate authorities to sign workload certificates on
different clusters.
If you need to back your signing keys in a managed HSM.
If you are in a highly regulated industry and are subject to compliance.
If you want to chain your Cloud Service Mesh CA to a custom
enterprise root certificate to sign workload certificates.
The cost of Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority is included in the
Cloud Service Mesh pricing. The cost of CA Service isn't
included in the base Cloud Service Mesh price and is charged
separately. Additionally, CA Service comes with an explicit SLA,
but Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority does not.
For this integration, all workloads in Cloud Service Mesh are granted two
IAM roles:
privateca.workloadCertificateRequester
privateca.auditor
Identity-aware access control (firewall) policies
With Cloud Service Mesh, you can configure network security policies
that are based on the mTLS identity versus the IP address of the peer. This lets
you create policies that are independent of the network location of the workload.
Only communications across clusters in the same Google Cloud project are supported.
Request claims-aware access control (firewall) policies
In addition to the mTLS identity, you can grant access based on request claims
in the JWT header of HTTP or gRPC requests. Cloud Service Mesh lets you
assert that a JWT is signed by a trusted entity. This means that you can
configure policies that allow access from certain clients only if a request
claim exists or matches a specified value.
User authentication with Identity-Aware Proxy
You authenticate users who are accessing any service exposed on a
Cloud Service Mesh ingress gateway by using
Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) . IAP can authenticate users
who are logging in from a browser, integrate with custom identity providers,
and issue a short-lived JWT token or an RCToken that can then be used to grant
access at the Ingress gateway or a downstream service (by using a side-car).
For more information, see
Integrating IAP with Cloud Service Mesh .
User authentication with your existing Identity Provider
You can integrate your existing Identity Provider with Cloud Service Mesh to
provide browser-based end-user authentication and access control to your
deployed workloads. For more information, see
Configuring Cloud Service Mesh user authentication .
Access logging and monitoring
Cloud Service Mesh ensures that access logs and metrics are available in
Google Cloud Observability , and provides an integrated dashboard
to understand access patterns for a service or workload based on this data.
FIPS compliant
The data plane component uses
FIPS 140-2 validated encryption
modules.
Limitations
Cloud Service Mesh security has the following limitation:
User authentication that uses IAP requires that a service be
published to the internet. IAP and Cloud Service Mesh
let you configure policies that can restrict access to authorized users and
clients in an allowed IP range. If you choose to only expose the service to
clients within the same network, you need to configure a custom policy engine
for user authentication and token issuance.
