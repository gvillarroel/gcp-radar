Cloud Service Mesh overview
Cloud Service Mesh is a service mesh available on Google Cloud
and across supported GKE platforms. It supports services running on a range of
computing infrastructures. Cloud Service Mesh is controlled by APIs
designed for Google Cloud, for open source, or for both.
This document is for you if you're a new Cloud Service Mesh user or a continuing Anthos Service Mesh or Traffic Director customer.
What is a service mesh?
A service mesh is an architecture that enables managed, observable, and secure
communication among your services, making it easier for you to create robust
enterprise applications made up of many microservices on your chosen
infrastructure. Service meshes manage the common requirements of running a
service, such as monitoring, networking, and security, with consistent, powerful
tools, making it easier for service developers and operators to focus on
creating and managing great applications for their users.
Architecturally, a service mesh consists of one or more control planes and a
data plane. The service mesh monitors all traffic into and out of your services.
On Kubernetes, a proxy is deployed by a
sidecar pattern
to the microservices in the mesh. On Compute Engine, you can deploy proxies on VMs
or use proxyless gRPC for the data plane.
This pattern decouples application or business
logic from network functions, and enables developers to focus on the features
that the business needs. Service meshes also let operations teams and
development teams decouple their work from one another.
Architecting your applications as microservices provides many benefits. However,
your workloads can become more complex and fragmented as they scale. Service
mesh helps solve the fragmentation problem and makes it easier to manage your
microservices.
What is Cloud Service Mesh?
Cloud Service Mesh is Google's solution for both Google Cloud
and supported GKE Enterprise environments.
On Google Cloud: Cloud Service Mesh provides APIs that are
specific to the computing infrastructure on which your workloads run.
For Compute Engine workloads, Cloud Service Mesh uses
Google Cloud-specific service routing APIs .
For Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) workloads, Cloud Service Mesh uses
the open source Istio APIs.
Off Google Cloud: With Distributed Cloud or GKE multicloud,
Cloud Service Mesh supports the Istio APIs for Kubernetes
workloads.
Whether on or off Google Cloud, Cloud Service Mesh lets you
manage, observe, and secure your services without having to change your
application code.
Cloud Service Mesh reduces the toil for your operations and development
teams by simplifying service delivery, from traffic management and mesh
telemetry to securing communications between services. Google's fully managed
service mesh lets you manage complex environments and enjoy the benefits they
promise.
Features
Cloud Service Mesh has a suite of features for traffic management,
observability and telemetry, and security.
Traffic management
Cloud Service Mesh controls the flow of traffic among services in the
mesh, into the mesh (ingress), and to outside services (egress). You configure
and deploy resources to manage this traffic at the application (L7) layer. For
example, you can do the following:
Use service discovery.
Configure load balancing among services.
Create canary and blue-green deployments.
Finely control routing for your services.
Set up circuit breakers.
Cloud Service Mesh maintains a list of all services in the mesh by name
and by their respective endpoints. It maintains this list to manage the flow of
traffic (for example, Kubernetes Pod IP addresses or the IP addresses of
Compute Engine VMs in a Managed instance group ).
By using this service registry, and by running the proxies side-by-side with the
services, the mesh can direct traffic to the appropriate endpoint.
Proxyless gRPC workloads
can also be used in parallel with workloads using Envoy proxies.
Observability insights
The Cloud Service Mesh user interface in the Google Cloud console
provides insights into your service mesh. These metrics are automatically
generated for workloads configured through the Istio APIs.
Service metrics and logs for HTTP traffic within your mesh's GKE
cluster are automatically ingested to Google Cloud.
Preconfigured service dashboards give you the information you need to
understand your services.
In-depth telemetry—powered by Cloud Monitoring ,
Cloud Logging , and Cloud Trace —lets you
dig deep into your service metrics and logs. You can filter and segment your
data on a wide variety of attributes.
Service-to-service relationships help you understand at a glance inter-service
dependences and who connects to each service.
You can quickly see the communication security posture not only of your
service, but its relationships to other services.
Service level objectives (SLOs) give you insight into the health of your
services. You can define an SLO and alert on your own standards of service
health.

Observability guide .
Security benefits
Cloud Service Mesh provides you with many security benefits.
Mitigates risk of replay or impersonation attacks that use stolen credentials.
Cloud Service Mesh relies on mutual TLS (mTLS) certificates to
authenticate peers, rather than bearer tokens such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) .
Ensures encryption in transit. Using mTLS for authentication also ensures that
all TCP communications are encrypted in transit.
Mitigates the risk that unauthorized clients can access a service with sensitive data,
irrespective of the network location of the client and the application-level
credentials.
Mitigates the risk of user data breach within your production network. You can
ensure that insiders can only access sensitive data through authorized clients.
Identifies which clients accessed a service with sensitive data. Cloud Service Mesh
access logging captures the mTLS identity of the client in addition to the
IP address.
All in-cluster control plane components and proxies are built with FIPS 140-2 validated encryption modules.

Security guide .
Deployment options
You have the following deployment options in Cloud Service Mesh:
On Google Cloud
Managed Cloud Service Mesh - managed control and data plane
for GKE (recommended)
Managed Cloud Service Mesh - managed control and data plane for
Compute Engine with VMs (recommended)
In-cluster control plane for GKE with Istio APIs (Discouraged)
Off Google Cloud
In-cluster control plane for Kubernetes with Istio APIs
Managed Cloud Service Mesh
Managed Cloud Service Mesh consists of the managed control plane for
all infrastructures and the managed data plane for GKE. With
Managed Cloud Service Mesh, Google handles upgrades, scaling, and
security for you, minimizing manual user maintenance. This covers the control
plane, data plane, and related resources.
Data plane implementation
If you use Google Cloud APIs, your data plane can be provided by Envoy
proxies or by proxyless gRPC applications. If you are updating an existing
application, the sidecar-based approach allows for integration into the mesh
without changing your application. If you want to avoid the overhead of running
a sidecar, you can update your application to use gRPC.
Envoy proxies and proxyless gRPC both use the xDS API to connect to the control
plane. If you use proxyless gRPC, you have a choice of supported languages for
your applications, including Go, C++, Java, and Python.
If you use open source Istio APIs, your data plane is provided by Envoy proxies.
Control plane implementation
Your Cloud Service Mesh control plane depends on whether your
configuration is on or off Google Cloud and whether you are a new
customer.
Control plane implementation for existing users
If your configuration is off Google Cloud, you are using
Cloud Service Mesh's in-cluster, unmanaged control plane. For more
information, see In-cluster control plane supported features .
If you were an Anthos Service Mesh user on Google Cloud, you are using
Istio APIs. For more information, see Supported features using Istio APIs (managed control plane) .
If you were a Traffic Director user, you are using Cloud Service Mesh's
managed control plane with Google Cloud APIs. For more information,
see Cloud Service Mesh with Google Cloud APIs supported
features .
To determine your current control plane, read Identify control plane implementation . For more
information on control planes and control plane migration, see Managed control plane overview for continuing customers .
Control plane implementation for new users
If you are planning an off-Google Cloud configuration, you are
choosing Cloud Service Mesh's in-cluster, unmanaged control plane.
For more information, see In-cluster control plane supported features .
If you are planning an on-Google Cloud configuration on Kubernetes,
you are choosing Istio APIs, but your control plane uses the Traffic
Director implementation, except in certain cases that are detailed in
What determines control plane implementation .
See Supported features using Istio APIs (managed control plane) for more details.
If you are planning an on-Google Cloud configuration on
Compute Engine VMs, your control plane uses the global, multi-tenant
control plane, known as the Traffic Director implementation. For more
information, see
Cloud Service Mesh with Google Cloud APIs supported features .
Control plane migration
If you are a continuing Anthos Service Mesh customer and you use the Istio APIs, your
clusters will start migrating to the Traffic Director control plane. You can
continue to use the Istio APIs for configuration.
To determine whether your clusters still use the Istio control plane or have
migrated to the new global control plane, read
Identify control plane implementation .
What's next
If you're a continuing user, read Managed control plane for continuing customers .
If you plan to set up with GKE, read Provision a control plane .
If you plan to set up with Compute Engine and VMs, read
Prepare to set up on service routing APIs with Envoy and proxyless workloads .
