VPC Service Controls for Cloud Service Mesh (Managed)
Note: This guide only supports Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs and does
not support Google Cloud APIs. For more information see,
Cloud Service Mesh overview .
Cloud Service Mesh (Managed) supports VPC Service Controls
as a generally available (GA) feature for new control planes.
To check whether your control plane supports VPC Service Controls GA, check the mesh feature
state of your membership for the VPCSC_GA_SUPPORTED condition.
gcloud container fleet mesh describe --project FLEET_PROJECT_ID
The output is similar to:
( ... )
membershipStates:
projects/FLEET_PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/MEMBERSHIP_LOCATION/memberships/MEMBERSHIP_ID:
servicemesh:
conditions:
- code: VPCSC_GA_SUPPORTED
details: This control plane supports VPC Service Controls GA.
documentationLink: http://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/managed/VPC Service Controls
severity: INFO
( ... )
If you have an existing control plane that does not report the
VPCSC_GA_SUPPORTED condition and want to rely on VPC Service Controls, contact support.
Before you begin
The VPC Service Controls org-policy and service perimeter are configured at the
organization level .
Ensure that you have been granted the
proper roles for administering VPC Service Controls .
Set up your VPC Service Controls service perimeter
Create or update your service perimeter :
Add your cluster project(s) and fleet project to the service perimeter. Having a service mesh spread across multiple VPC Service Controls
perimeters is not supported.
Add restricted services to the service perimeter.
You must add specific services to the allowed and restricted services lists in
the service perimeter, so that your Cloud Service Mesh cluster can access them.
Access to these services is also restricted within your cluster's
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.
Not adding these services may cause the Cloud Service Mesh installation to fail or to
not function properly. For example, if you don't add the
Mesh Configuration API to the service perimeter, the installation will fail
and the workloads won't receive their Envoy configuration from the managed
control plane.
Console
Follow the steps in
Updating a service perimeter
to edit the perimeter.
Click the Edit VPC Service Perimeter page.
Under Restricted Services ,
Services to protect , click Add Services .
On the Specify services to restrict dialog, click Filter
services , and enter Mesh Configuration API .
Select the service's checkbox.
Click Add Mesh Configuration API .
Repeat steps c - f, to add:
Cloud Service Mesh Certificate Authority API
GKE Hub API
Cloud IAM API
Cloud Monitoring API
Cloud Trace API
Cloud Monitoring API
Google Cloud Resource Manager API
Google Compute Engine API
Google Container Registry API
Artifact Registry API
Google Cloud Storage API
Cloud Logging API
Security Token Service API
Click Save .
gcloud
To update the list of restricted services, use the update command and
specify the services to add as a comma-delimited list:
gcloud access-context-manager perimeters update PERIMETER_NAME \
--add-restricted-services = meshconfig.googleapis.com,meshca.googleapis.com,gkehub.googleapis.com,iam.googleapis.com,monitoring.googleapis.com,cloudtrace.googleapis.com,monitoring.googleapis.com,cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com,compute.googleapis.com,containerregistry.googleapis.com,artifactregistry.googleapis.com,storage.googleapis.com,logging.googleapis.com,sts.googleapis.com \
--policy = POLICY_NAME
Where:
PERIMETER_NAME is the name of the service perimeter that you
want to update.
POLICY_NAME is the numeric name of your organization's access
policy. For example, 330193482019 .
Click on VPC Accessible services and set it to 'All restricted services', so that services restricted at the step above are still accessible from within the VPC Service Controls perimeter.
Unless you are installing Cloud Service Mesh from an in-perimeter network, add an
ingress rule to allow the identity running the asmcli command access to the
service perimeter.
For more information, see
Updating a service perimeter .
Install the managed Cloud Service Mesh in a VPC Service Controls perimeter
Follow the steps in
Configure managed Cloud Service Mesh
page. Then,
verify the control plane has been successfully provisioned
and there are no VPC Service Controls related errors.
Troubleshooting
Cannot create cluster with the latest GKE 1.22 image
There is a known issue preventing the creation of a cluster with the latest
1.22 image in a VPC Service Controls restricted environment. The workaround is to create this
cluster first with the default GKE channel image, and then upgrade the image:
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER \
--region REGION \
--release-channel = rapid \
--workload-pool = PROJECT_ID .svc.id.goog \
--project PROJECT_ID
gcloud container clusters upgrade CLUSTER \
--region REGION \
--master --cluster-version 1 .22 \
--project PROJECT_ID
Containers are not able to download their images.
This may happen if the images are located outside of the service perimeter.
Either move the images to a bucket located inside the perimeter, or update the
perimeter to add an Egress rule. Typically, the Egress rule may allow selected
identities to access the Container Registry API , Artifact Registry API ,
and Cloud Storage API .
The Status field of the ControlPlaneRevision CRD displays VPC Service Controls errors
Run this command to get more info about the error:
gcloud logging read --project = PROJECT_ID \
'protoPayload.metadata.@type=type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.VpcServiceControlAuditMetadata'
Where:
PROJECT_ID is the project ID of the project encountering errors.
