Managed control plane for continuing customers
This document is for you if you're a continuing Anthos Service Mesh customer
using the managed control plane or in-cluster control plane. This document
discusses your control plane implementation and the possible modernization of your
control plane.
If you're a continuing Traffic Director customer or a new customer, you already
have the modernized control plane and don't need to read this document or the
others in this section.
Control plane overview
In service meshes, the control plane provides traffic management, proxy
management when the Envoy proxy is in use, and other networking capabilities.
Anthos Service Mesh offered two control planes: a managed control plane and an
in-cluster control plane. Only Envoy proxies are used as the data plane.
New managed control plane
The new managed control plane is called the Traffic Director (TD)
implementation. What does the new control plane mean for you?
One of the most significant changes from the Anthos Service Mesh product to
Cloud Service Mesh is the move to a multi-tenant, global control plane.
The managed control plane used in Anthos Service Mesh is dedicated to a single
cluster. Although the APIs (Istio CRDs) used for GKE are the same, and the xDS
configuration sent to the sidecars is compatible with no behavioral differences,
the control plane differences result in a few characteristics that are
visible to you, the end user.
Configuration change response time. New service deployments, or changes to
service policies, take slightly longer with the new control plane.
The configuration pipeline performs a two-pass configuration commit for
reliability purposes. The first pass performs validations to check
whether the configuration is well formed. The subsequent phase
propagates the configuration globally to your service deployments. To
enable use of Google Cloud services, such as global cross-zonal or cross-region load
balancing, centralized health checking, traffic-driven autoscaling, and
managed rate limiting, the configuration is propagated to these systems
and independently validated for correctness. The configuration is also
stored internally in a manner that allows Google site reliability
engineering to reliably and efficiently perform product operations
during any production emergencies.
These operations provide better reliability, but they result in a config
push that is slower than the latency observed by current users of Anthos
Service Mesh.
The latency for any new Pod to fetch existing configuration is
measured to be slightly better with the new control plane. The slow
configuration push is for the first-time propagation of any new service
created or any new policies pushed for the service. Endpoint propagation
latencies are functionally similar.
Speed of scaling events and other changes to the endpoints. These are
handled at least as quickly with the new control plane. These events
include new Pods starting or stopping because of horizontal Pod autoscaling,
and Pods restarting with new IP addresses because they were moved to a different
node in the cluster.
Scaling the number of endpoints. With the new global control plane, the
endpoints of the mesh are sent directly from each cluster to the control
plane from across all clusters in the mesh. This is a simpler, faster, and
more scalable approach than the previous managed control plane uses. In
older managed control plane (dedicated control plane) model, each Istiod must
communicate with every other cluster in the mesh to determine the endpoints
available in every other cluster. With the global control plane, the
endpoints are propagated directly to the global control plane. This results
in better reliability and performance in meshes with large numbers of
endpoints and allows the meshes to scale to a larger number of endpoints.
How does the new control plane affect you?
How the new control plane affects you depends on the APIs and control plane that
you are using.
If you are a Traffic Director user, your control plane remains the same. You
don't need to read the rest of this guide. Documentation for your
Cloud Service Mesh implementation is under Configure with
Google Cloud APIs .
If you are an Anthos Service Mesh user, the next steps for the control plane
in your existing deployment depend on whether you use the managed control
plane or the in-cluster control plane.
If you use the managed control plane, with some exceptions your existing
fleets will be migrated to the new control plane, referred to in the
Cloud Service Mesh as managed control plane (Traffic Director,
or TD, implementation). Read the following section, Control plane
modernization for existing meshes and fleets . If
you are using a feature that isn't supported by the Traffic Director
control plane implementation, you remain temporarily on the previous
control plane. You should continue reading this guide.
If you use the in-cluster control plane, your control plane remains the
same. You don't need to read the rest of this guide.
If you don't have a Google Cloud Organization, and you use the
managed control plane on an organization-less project, you will receive
the TD control plane.
If you are an Anthos Service Mesh customer and you are creating new fleets,
you will receive the Traffic Director control plane implementation. You
should continue reading this guide.
You will be notified about the date when
new fleets receive the TD control plane.

Check control plane compatibility
Review differences in supported features between managed control plane
implementations to determine
whether your current usage of Cloud Service Mesh will require changes.
Control plane for new meshes
Starting on July 1, 2024, most existing users of the managed istiod control
plane implementation began to receive the updated managed control plane
with Google's globally available implementation - the Traffic Director (TD)
control plane, in new fleets.
Users whose existing usage of managed Cloud Service Mesh with the istiod
control plane implementation was not compatible with the Traffic Director
implementation without changes continued to get the istiod implementation
until September 8, 2024.
A small number of users were further snowflaked to get continue getting the
istiod control plane implementation in new fleets. If this applies to your
organization then you received a Service Announcement.
If you onboard a new fleet to managed Cloud Service Mesh, and this fleet is not
in a Google Cloud Organization or it is in a new Google Cloud Organization,
then you will get the new managed control plane with the TD implementation from
the Cloud Service Mesh launch date.
