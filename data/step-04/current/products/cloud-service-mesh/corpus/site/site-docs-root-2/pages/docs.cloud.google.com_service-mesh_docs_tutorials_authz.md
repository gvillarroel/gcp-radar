Cloud Service Mesh overview .
In this tutorial, you will learn what authorization is, and how to enable it
with Cloud Service Mesh on a sample application to learn how to enable
authorization policies to your microservices. You will create an
AuthorizationPolicy to DENY access to a microservice, then create an
AuthorizationPolicy to ALLOW specific access to a microservice.
What is authorization?
Authentication verifies an identity -- is this service who they say they are?
Authorization verifies the permission - is this service allowed to do that?
Identity is fundamental to this idea. With Cloud Service Mesh,
AuthorizationPolicies allow for workload-to-workload communication in your
mesh to be controlled for improved security and access.
In a microservice architecture, where calls are made across network boundaries,
IP-based firewall rules are often not adequate to secure access between
workloads. With Cloud Service Mesh, you can set authorization rules to:
Control access to workloads within your mesh, either workload-to-workload or
end-user-to-workload
Broadly or granularly define policies depending on your needs.
To see an in-depth explanation on configuring policies and best practices, see
Authorization with Cloud Service Mesh .
Costs
This tutorial uses the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
Cloud Service Mesh
When you finish this tutorial, you can avoid ongoing costs by deleting the
resources you created. For more information, see Clean up .
Before you begin
Ensure billing is enabled for your project .
Provision Cloud Service Mesh on a GKE cluster. There are
various supported setup methods:
Fleet API and a managed control plane on Google Cloud
asmcli and an unmanaged, in-cluster control plane off Google Cloud
Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-service-mesh-samples
cd anthos-service-mesh-samples
Deploy an ingress gateway
Set the current context for kubectl to the cluster:
Note: Use --region instead of --zone , if the cluster is a regional
cluster.
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--zone= CLUSTER_LOCATION
Create a namespace for your ingress gateway:
kubectl create namespace asm-ingress
Enable the namespace for injection. The steps depend on your control plane implementation .
Managed (TD)
Apply the default injection label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace asm-ingress \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
Managed (Istiod)
Recommended: Run the following command to apply the default injection label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace asm-ingress \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
If you are an existing user with the Managed Istiod control plane:
We recommend that you use default injection, but revision-based injection is
supported. Use the following instructions:
Run the following command to locate the available release channels:
kubectl -n istio-system get controlplanerevision
The output is similar to the following:
NAME AGE
asm-managed-rapid 6d7h
Note: If two control plane revisions appear in the earlier list, remove one. Having multiple control plane channels in the cluster is not supported.
In the output, the value under the NAME column is the revision label that corresponds to the available release channel for the Cloud Service Mesh version.
Apply the revision label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace asm-ingress \
istio-injection- istio.io/rev = REVISION_LABEL --overwrite
In-cluster
Recommended: Run the following command to apply the default injection label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace asm-ingress \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
We recommend that you use default injection, but revision-based injection is supported:
Use the following instructions:
Use the following command to locate the revision label on istiod :
kubectl get deploy -n istio-system -l app = istiod -o \
jsonpath ={ .items [ * ] .metadata.labels. 'istio\.io\/rev' } '{"\n"}'
Apply the revision label to the namespace. In the following command,
REVISION_LABEL is the value of the istiod revision
label that you noted in the previous step.
kubectl label namespace asm-ingress \
istio-injection- istio.io/rev = REVISION_LABEL --overwrite
Deploy the example gateway in the anthos-service-mesh-samples repository:
kubectl apply -n asm-ingress \
-f docs/shared/asm-ingress-gateway
Expected output:
serviceaccount/asm-ingressgateway configured
service/asm-ingressgateway configured
deployment.apps/asm-ingressgateway configured
gateway.networking.istio.io/asm-ingressgateway configured
Deploy the Online Boutique sample application
If you haven't, set the current context for kubectl to the cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--zone= CLUSTER_LOCATION
Create the namespace for the sample application:
kubectl create namespace onlineboutique
Label the onlineboutique namespace to automatically inject Envoy proxies:
kubectl label namespace onlineboutique \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection=enabled --overwrite
Deploy the sample app, the VirtualService for the frontend, and service accounts for the workloads. For this tutorial, you will deploy Online Boutique , a microservice demo app.
kubectl apply \
-n onlineboutique \
-f docs/shared/online-boutique/virtual-service.yaml
kubectl apply \
-n onlineboutique \
-f docs/shared/online-boutique/service-accounts
View your services
View the pods in the onlineboutique namespace:
kubectl get pods -n onlineboutique
Expected output:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
adservice-85598d856b-m84m6 2/2 Running 0 2m7s
cartservice-c77f6b866-m67vd 2/2 Running 0 2m8s
checkoutservice-654c47f4b6-hqtqr 2/2 Running 0 2m10s
currencyservice-59bc889674-jhk8z 2/2 Running 0 2m8s
emailservice-5b9fff7cb8-8nqwz 2/2 Running 0 2m10s
frontend-77b88cc7cb-mr4rp 2/2 Running 0 2m9s
loadgenerator-6958f5bc8b-55q7w 2/2 Running 0 2m8s
paymentservice-68dd9755bb-2jmb7 2/2 Running 0 2m9s
productcatalogservice-84f95c95ff-c5kl6 2/2 Running 0 114s
recommendationservice-64dc9dfbc8-xfs2t 2/2 Running 0 2m9s
redis-cart-5b569cd47-cc2qd 2/2 Running 0 2m7s
shippingservice-5488d5b6cb-lfhtt 2/2 Running 0 2m7s
All of the pods for your application should be up and running, with a 2/2 in the READY column. This indicates that the pods have an Envoy sidecar proxy injected successfully. If it does not show 2/2 after a couple of minutes, visit the Troubleshooting guide .
Get the external IP, and set it to a variable:
kubectl get services -n asm-ingress
export FRONTEND_IP=$(kubectl --namespace asm-ingress \
get service --output jsonpath='{.items[0].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}' \
)
You see output similar to the following:
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
asm-ingressgateway LoadBalancer 10.19.247.233 35.239.7.64 80:31380/TCP,443:31390/TCP,31400:31400/TCP 27m
Visit the EXTERNAL-IP address in your web browser. You should expect to see
the Online Boutique shop in your browser.
DenyAll Authorization for a workload
This section adds an AuthorizationPolicy to deny all incoming traffic to the
currency service. AuthorizationPolicies work by transforming
AuthorizationPolicies into Envoy-readable configs, and applying the configs to
your sidecar proxies. This enables the Envoy proxy to authorize or deny incoming
requests to a service.
Apply an AuthorizationPolicy to the currencyservice . Notice the match
on the label currencyservice in the YAML file.
kubectl apply -f docs/authorization/currency-deny-all.yaml -n onlineboutique
apiVersion : security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind : AuthorizationPolicy
metadata :
name : currency-policy
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
app : currencyservice
Try accessing your gateway's EXTERNAL-IP to view Online Boutique in the web
browser. You should see an authorization error (500 Internal Service Error)
from currency service .
Observe your sidecar proxy logs
To see what is occurring in the sidecar proxy, you can review the logs in the
pod.
Get the name of your currencyservice pod:
CURRENCY_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n onlineboutique |grep currency|awk '{print $1}')
Set the Envoy proxy to allow for trace level logs. By default, blocked authorization calls are not logged:
kubectl debug --image istio/base --target istio-proxy -it $CURRENCY_POD -n onlineboutique -- curl -X POST "http://localhost:15000/logging?level=trace"
Expected output:
none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
active loggers:
admin: trace
alternate_protocols_cache: trace
...
tracing: trace
upstream: trace
udp: trace
wasm: trace
Use curl to send traffic to your EXTERNAL_IP to generate logs:
for i in {0..10}; do
curl -s -I $FRONTEND_IP ; done
View the role-based access control (RBAC) related logs in your istio-proxy:
kubectl logs -n onlineboutique $CURRENCY_POD -c istio-proxy | grep -m5 rbac
Expected output:
2022-07-08T14:19:20.442920Z debug envoy rbac checking request: requestedServerName: outbound_.7000_._.currencyservice.onlineboutique.svc.cluster.local, sourceIP: 10.8.8.5:34080, directRemoteIP: 10.8.8.5:34080, remoteIP: 10.8.8.5:34080,localAddress: 10.8.0.6:7000, ssl: uriSanPeerCertificate: spiffe://christineskim-tf-asm.svc.id.goog/ns/onlineboutique/sa/default, dnsSanPeerCertificate: , subjectPeerCertificate: OU=istio_v1_cloud_workload,O=Google LLC,L=Mountain View,ST=California,C=US, headers: ':method', 'POST'
2022-07-08T14:19:20.442944Z debug envoy rbac enforced denied, matched policy none
2022-07-08T14:19:20.442965Z debug envoy http [C73987][S13078781800499437460] Sending local reply with details rbac_access_denied_matched_policy[none]
```
You should see an enforced denied message in the logs, showing that
currencyservice is set to block inbound requests.
Allow Restricted Access
Instead of a DENYALL policy, you can set access to be allowed for certain
workloads. This will be relevant in a microservice architecture where you want
to ensure that only authorized services can communicate with each other.
In this section, you will enable the frontend and checkout service the
ability to communicate with the currency service.
In the following file, see that a specific source.principal (client) is
allowed to access currencyservice :
apiVersion : security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind : AuthorizationPolicy
metadata :
name : currency-policy
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
app : currencyservice
rules :
- from :
- source :
principals : [ "cluster.local/ns/onlineboutique/sa/frontend" ]
- from :
- source :
principals : [ "cluster.local/ns/onlineboutique/sa/checkoutservice" ]
Apply the policy:
kubectl apply -f docs/authorization/currency-allow-frontend-checkout.yaml -n onlineboutique
Visit the EXTERNAL-IP in your web browser, you should now be able to access
Online Boutique.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
To avoid incurring continuing charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used in this tutorial, you can either
delete the project or delete
the individual resources .
Delete the project
Caution: Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project
for this tutorial, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost. When you created this project, you might
have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future.
To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com URL,
delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole
project.
In Cloud Shell, delete the project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete the resources
If you want to keep your cluster and remove the Online Boutique sample:
Delete the application namespaces:
kubectl delete namespace onlineboutique
Expected output:
namespace "onlineboutique" deleted
Delete the Ingress Gateway namespace:
kubectl delete namespace asm-ingress
Expected output:
namespace "asm-ingress" deleted
If you want to prevent additional charges, delete the cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--zone= CLUSTER_LOCATION
