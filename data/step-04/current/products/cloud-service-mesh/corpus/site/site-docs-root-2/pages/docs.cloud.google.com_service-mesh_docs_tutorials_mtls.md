Cloud Service Mesh by example: mTLS
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: This guide only supports Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs and does
not support Google Cloud APIs. For more information see,
Cloud Service Mesh overview .
In Cloud Service Mesh 1.5 and later, auto mutual TLS (auto mTLS) is enabled by
default. With auto mTLS, a client sidecar proxy automatically detects if the
server has a sidecar. The client sidecar sends mTLS to workloads with sidecars
and sends plaintext to workloads without sidecars. Note, however, services
accept both plaintext and mTLS traffic. As you
inject sidecar proxies to your Pods, we
recommend that you also configure your services to only accept mTLS traffic.
With Cloud Service Mesh, you can enforce mTLS, outside of your application code, by
applying a single YAML file. Cloud Service Mesh gives you the flexibility to apply an
authentication policy to the entire service mesh, to a namespace, or to an
individual workload.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
GKE
Cloud Service Mesh
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
use the pricing calculator .
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a free trial .
When you finish this tutorial, you can avoid ongoing costs by deleting the
resources you created. For more information, see Clean up .
Before you begin
Ensure billing is enabled for your project .
Provision Cloud Service Mesh on a GKE cluster. There are
various supported setup methods:
Fleet API and a managed control plane on Google Cloud
asmcli and an unmanaged, in-cluster control plane off Google Cloud
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-service-mesh-samples
cd anthos-service-mesh-samples
Deploy an ingress gateway
Set the current context for kubectl to the cluster:
Note: Use --region instead of --zone , if the cluster is a regional
cluster.
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--zone= CLUSTER_LOCATION
Create a namespace for your ingress gateway:
kubectl create namespace asm-ingress
Enable the namespace for injection. The steps depend on your control plane implementation .
Managed (TD)
Apply the default injection label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace asm-ingress \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
Managed (Istiod)
Recommended: Run the following command to apply the default injection label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace asm-ingress \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
If you are an existing user with the Managed Istiod control plane:
We recommend that you use default injection, but revision-based injection is
supported. Use the following instructions:
Run the following command to locate the available release channels:
kubectl -n istio-system get controlplanerevision
The output is similar to the following:
NAME AGE
asm-managed-rapid 6d7h
Note: If two control plane revisions appear in the earlier list, remove one. Having multiple control plane channels in the cluster is not supported.
In the output, the value under the NAME column is the revision label that corresponds to the available release channel for the Cloud Service Mesh version.
Apply the revision label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace asm-ingress \
istio-injection- istio.io/rev = REVISION_LABEL --overwrite
Deploy the example gateway in the anthos-service-mesh-samples repository:
kubectl apply -n asm-ingress \
-f docs/shared/asm-ingress-gateway
Expected output:
serviceaccount/asm-ingressgateway configured
service/asm-ingressgateway configured
deployment.apps/asm-ingressgateway configured
gateway.networking.istio.io/asm-ingressgateway configured
Deploy the Online Boutique sample application
If you haven't, set the current context for kubectl to the cluster:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--zone= CLUSTER_LOCATION
Create the namespace for the sample application:
kubectl create namespace onlineboutique
Label the onlineboutique namespace to automatically inject Envoy proxies.
Follow the steps to enable automatic sidecar injection .
Deploy the sample app, the VirtualService for the frontend, and service accounts for the workloads. For this tutorial, you will deploy Online Boutique , a microservice demo app.
kubectl apply \
-n onlineboutique \
-f docs/shared/online-boutique/virtual-service.yaml
kubectl apply \
-n onlineboutique \
-f docs/shared/online-boutique/service-accounts
View your services
View the pods in the onlineboutique namespace:
kubectl get pods -n onlineboutique
Expected output:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
adservice-85598d856b-m84m6 2/2 Running 0 2m7s
cartservice-c77f6b866-m67vd 2/2 Running 0 2m8s

loadgenerator-6958f5bc8b-55q7w 2/2 Running 0 2m8s
paymentservice-68dd9755bb-2jmb7 2/2 Running 0 2m9s
productcatalogservice-84f95c95ff-c5kl6 2/2 Running 0 114s
recommendationservice-64dc9dfbc8-xfs2t 2/2 Running 0 2m9s
redis-cart-5b569cd47-cc2qd 2/2 Running 0 2m7s
shippingservice-5488d5b6cb-lfhtt 2/2 Running 0 2m7s
All of the pods for your application should be up and running, with a 2/2 in the READY column. This indicates that the pods have an Envoy sidecar proxy injected successfully. If it does not show 2/2 after a couple of minutes, visit the Troubleshooting guide .
Get the external IP, and set it to a variable:
kubectl get services -n asm-ingress
export FRONTEND_IP=$(kubectl --namespace asm-ingress \
get service --output jsonpath='{.items[0].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}' \
)
You see output similar to the following:
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
asm-ingressgateway LoadBalancer 10.19.247.233 35.239.7.64 80:31380/TCP,443:31390/TCP,31400:31400/TCP 27m
Visit the EXTERNAL-IP address in your web browser. You should expect to see
the Online Boutique shop in your browser.
Create a TestCurl pod
Create a TestCurl pod to send plaintext traffic for testing.
apiVersion : v1
kind : Pod
metadata :
name : testcurl
namespace : default
annotations :
sidecar.istio.io/inject : "false"
spec :
containers :
- name : curl
image : curlimages/curl
command : [ "sleep" , "600" ]
Access Online Boutique
Set the current context for kubectl to the cluster where you deployed
Online Boutique:
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--zone= CLUSTER_LOCATION
List the services in the frontend namespace:
kubectl get services -n frontend
Notice that frontend-external is a LoadBalancer , and it has an
external IP address. The sample application includes a service that is a
load balancer so that it can be deployed on GKE without
Cloud Service Mesh.
Visit the application in your browser using the external IP address of the
frontend-external service:
http : // FRONTEND_EXTERNAL_IP /
Cloud Service Mesh provides you the ability to deploy an ingress gateway. You can
also access the Online Boutique using the external IP address of the ingress
gateway. Get the external IP of the gateway. Replace the placeholders with
the following information:
GATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME : The name of the ingress gateway
service. If you deployed the sample gateway without modification, or if
you deployed the
default ingress gateway ,
the name is istio-ingressgateway .
GATEWAY_NAMESPACE : The namespace in which you deployed
the ingress gateway. If you deployed the default ingress gateway, the
namespace is istio-system .
kubectl get service GATEWAY_NAME -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
Open another tab in your browser and visit the application using the
external IP address of the ingress gateway:
http:// INGRESS_GATEWAY_EXTERNAL_IP /
Run the following command to curl the frontend service with plain HTTP
from another Pod. Because the services are in different namespaces, you
need to curl the DNS name
of the frontend service.
kubectl debug --image istio/base --target istio-proxy -it \
$(kubectl get pod -l app=productcatalogservice -n product-catalog -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) \
-n product-catalog -- \
curl http://frontend.frontend.svc.cluster.local:80/ -o /dev/null -s -w '%{http_code}\n'
Your request succeeds with status 200 , because by default, both TLS and
plaintext traffic are accepted.
Enable mutual TLS per namespace
You enforce mTLS by applying a PeerAuthentication policy with kubectl .
Save the following authentication policy as mtls-namespace.yaml .
cat <<EOF > mtls-namespace.yaml
apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
kind: "PeerAuthentication"
metadata:
name: "namespace-policy"
spec:
mtls:
mode: STRICT
EOF
The line mode: STRICT in the YAML configures the services to only
accept mTLS. By default, the mode is PERMISSIVE , which configures
services to accept both plaintext and mTLS.
Apply the authentication policy to configure all Online Boutique
services to only accept mTLS:
for ns in ad cart checkout currency email frontend loadgenerator \
payment product - catalog recommendation shipping ; do
kubectl apply - n $ ns - f mtls - namespace . yaml
done
Expected output:
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/namespace-policy created
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/namespace-policy created
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/namespace-policy created
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/namespace-policy created
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/namespace-policy created
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/namespace-policy created
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/namespace-policy created
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/namespace-policy created
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/namespace-policy created
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/namespace-policy created
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/namespace-policy created
Go to the tab in your browser that accesses the Online Boutique using the
external IP address of the frontend-external service:
http : // FRONTEND_EXTERNAL_IP /
Refresh the page. The browser displays the following error:
Refreshing the page causes plaintext to be sent to the frontend service.
Because of the STRICT authentication policy, the sidecar proxy blocks the
request to the service.
Go to the tab in your browser that accesses the Online Boutique using the
external IP address of the istio-ingressgateway , and refresh the page,
which displays successfully. When you access Online Boutique using the
ingress gateway, the request takes the following path:
mTLS authentication flow:
The browser sends a plaintext HTTP request to the server.
The ingress gateway proxy container intercepts the request.
The ingress gateway proxy performs a TLS handshake with the
server-side proxy (the frontend service in this example). This handshake
includes an exchange of certificates. These certs are pre-loaded into
the proxy containers by Cloud Service Mesh.
The ingress gateway proxy performs a secure naming check on the
server's certificate, verifying that an authorized identity is running
the server.
The ingress gateway and server proxies establish a mutual TLS
connection, and the server proxy forwards the request to the server
application container (the frontend service).
Run the following command to curl the frontend service with plain HTTP
from another Pod.
kubectl exec testcurl -n default -- curl \
http://frontend.frontend.svc.cluster.local:80/ -o /dev/null -s -w '%{http_code}\n'
Your request fails as we are sending plaintext traffic from sidecar-less workload where STRICT peerAuthentication policy is applied.
Find and delete authentication policies
For a list of all the PeerAuthentication policies in the service mesh:
kubectl get peerauthentication --all-namespaces
The output is similar to the following:
NAMESPACE NAME MODE AGE
ad namespace-policy STRICT 17m
cart namespace-policy STRICT 17m
checkout namespace-policy STRICT 17m
currency namespace-policy STRICT 17m
email namespace-policy STRICT 17m
frontend namespace-policy STRICT 17m
loadgenerator namespace-policy STRICT 17m
payment namespace-policy STRICT 17m
product-catalog namespace-policy STRICT 17m
recommendation namespace-policy STRICT 17m
shipping namespace-policy STRICT 17m
Delete the authentication policy from all of the Online Boutique
namespaces:
for ns in ad cart checkout currency email frontend loadgenerator payment \
product - catalog recommendation shipping ; do
kubectl delete peerauthentication - n $ ns namespace - policy
done ;
Expected output:
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "namespace-policy" deleted
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "namespace-policy" deleted
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "namespace-policy" deleted
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "namespace-policy" deleted
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "namespace-policy" deleted
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "namespace-policy" deleted
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "namespace-policy" deleted
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "namespace-policy" deleted
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "namespace-policy" deleted
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "namespace-policy" deleted
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "namespace-policy" deleted
Access the Online Boutique using the external IP address of the
frontend-external service, and refresh the page. The page displays as
expected.
Run the following command to curl the frontend service with plain HTTP
from another Pod.
kubectl debug --image istio/base --target istio-proxy -it \
$(kubectl get pod -l app=productcatalogservice -n product-catalog -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) \
-n product-catalog -- \
curl http://frontend.frontend.svc.cluster.local:80/ -o /dev/null -s -w '%{http_code}\n'
Your request succeeds with status 200 , because by default, both TLS and
plaintext traffic are accepted.
If you refresh the page in the Google Cloud console that displays the
Workloads list, it now shows that the mTLS status is Permissive .
Enable mutual TLS per workload
To set a PeerAuthentication policy for a specific workload, you must configure
the selector section and specify the labels that match the desired workload.
However, Cloud Service Mesh can't aggregate workload-level policies for outbound
mTLS traffic to a service. You need to configure a destination rule to manage
that behavior.
Apply an authentication policy to a specific workload. Notice how the
following policy uses labels and selectors to target the specific frontend
deployment.
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n frontend -f -
apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
kind: "PeerAuthentication"
metadata:
name: "frontend"
namespace: "frontend"
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
mtls:
mode: STRICT
EOF
Expected output:
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/frontend created
Configure a matching destination rule.
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n frontend -f -
apiVersion: "networking.istio.io/v1alpha3"
kind: "DestinationRule"
metadata:
name: "frontend"
spec:
host: "frontend.demo.svc.cluster.local"
trafficPolicy:
tls:
mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL
EOF
Expected output:
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/frontend created
Access the Online Boutique using the external IP address of the
frontend-external service, and refresh the page. The page doesn't
display because because the frontend service is set to
STRICT mTLS, and the sidecar proxy blocks the request.
Run the following command to curl the frontend service with plain HTTP
from another Pod.
kubectl exec testcurl -n default -- curl \
http://frontend.frontend.svc.cluster.local:80/ -o /dev/null -s -w '%{http_code}\n'
Your request fails as we are sending plaintext traffic from sidecar-less workload where STRICT peerAuthentication policy is applied.
Delete the authentication policy:
kubectl delete peerauthentication -n frontend frontend
Expected output:
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "frontend" deleted
Delete the destination rule:
kubectl delete destinationrule -n frontend frontend
Expected output:
destinationrule.networking.istio.io "frontend" deleted
Enforcing mesh-wide mTLS
To prevent all your services in the mesh from accepting plaintext traffic, set
a mesh-wide PeerAuthentication policy with the mTLS mode set to STRICT .
The mesh-wide PeerAuthentication policy shouldn't have a selector and must be
applied in the root namespace, istio-system . When you deploy the policy, the
control plane automatically provisions TLS certificates so that workloads can
authenticate with each other.
Enforce mesh-wide mTLS:
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
kind: "PeerAuthentication"
metadata:
name: "mesh-wide"
namespace: "istio-system"
spec:
mtls:
mode: STRICT
EOF
Expected output:
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/mesh-wide created
Access the Online Boutique using the external IP address of the
frontend-external service, and refresh the page. The page doesn't
display.
Run the following command to curl the frontend service with plain HTTP
from another Pod.
kubectl exec testcurl -n default -- curl \
http://frontend.frontend.svc.cluster.local:80/ -o /dev/null -s -w '%{http_code}\n'
Your request fails as we are sending plaintext traffic from sidecar-less workload where STRICT peerAuthentication policy is applied.
Delete the mesh-wide policy:
kubectl delete peerauthentication -n istio-system mesh-wide
Expected output:
peerauthentication.security.istio.io "mesh-wide" deleted
Note: For more information on authorization policies, see
Cloud Service Mesh by example: Authorization .
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
If you want to prevent additional charges, delete the cluster:
gcloud container clusters delete CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--zone= CLUSTER_LOCATION
If you want to keep your cluster and remove the Online Boutique sample:
Delete the application namespaces:
kubectl delete -f online-boutique/kubernetes-manifests/namespaces
Expected output:
namespace "ad" deleted
namespace "cart" deleted
namespace "checkout" deleted
namespace "currency" deleted
namespace "email" deleted
namespace "frontend" deleted
namespace "loadgenerator" deleted
namespace "payment" deleted
namespace "product-catalog" deleted
namespace "recommendation" deleted
namespace "shipping" deleted
Delete the service entries:
kubectl delete -f online-boutique/istio-manifests/allow-egress-googleapis.yaml
Expected output:
serviceentry.networking.istio.io "allow-egress-googleapis" deleted
serviceentry.networking.istio.io "allow-egress-google-metadata" deleted
