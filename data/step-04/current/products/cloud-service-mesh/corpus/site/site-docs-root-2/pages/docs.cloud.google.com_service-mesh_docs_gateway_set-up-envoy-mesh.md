Set up an Envoy sidecar service mesh on GKE
This page describes how to set up an Envoy sidecar service mesh on
GKE.
Prerequisites
As a starting point, this guide assumes that you have already:
Created a GKE cluster and registered it to a fleet .
Installed the custom resource definitions .
Set up the Service
Create a sample HTTP service:
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
kind: Namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: sidecar-example
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: whereami
namespace: sidecar-example
spec:
replicas: 2
selector:
matchLabels:
app: whereami
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: whereami
spec:
containers:
- name: whereami
image: us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/whereami:v1
ports:
- containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: whereami
namespace: sidecar-example
spec:
selector:
app: whereami
ports:
- port: 8080
targetPort: 8080
EOF
Create a baseline HTTPRoute for the service:
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
name: whereami-route
namespace: sidecar-example
spec:
parentRefs:
- name: whereami
kind: Service
group: ""
rules:
- backendRefs:
- name: whereami
port: 8080
EOF
Alternatively, the following manifest describes a sample gRPC Service:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: sample-service
namespace: sample-ns
annotations:
networking.gke.io/app-protocols: '{"50051": "HTTP2"}' # 50051 is backendref.port
spec:
ports:
- port: 50051
targetPort: 50051
Note: If you are setting up a Service that runs gRPC but uses an Envoy
sidecar proxy, the Service metadata should include
networking.gke.io/app-protocols: '{"<port>": "HTTP2"}' label to apply the
correct protocol to the backend service.
Set up the Client
Run the following command to enable sidecar injection in the
sidecar-example namespace:
kubectl label namespace sidecar-example mesh.cloud.google.com/csm-injection = sidecar
Create a client:
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
labels:
run: client
name: client
namespace: sidecar-example
spec:
replicas: 1
selector:
matchLabels:
run: client
template:
metadata:
labels:
run: client
spec:
containers:
- name: client
image: curlimages/curl
command:
- sh
- -c
- while true ; do sleep 1 ; done
EOF
Verify that the client Pod has an Envoy sidecar container automatically
injected:
kubectl get pods -n sidecar-example -l run = client
The output is similar to:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
client-xxxx 2/2 Running 0 20s
Wait for the client to be ready and have the Status Running before
continuing.
Verify Envoy-sidecar service mesh setup. The following command sends a
request to the whereami service from the client
CLIENT_POD = $( kubectl get pod -n sidecar-example -l run = client -o = jsonpath = '{.items[0].metadata.name}' )
# The VIP where the following request will be sent. Because all requests
# from the client container are redirected to the Envoy proxy sidecar, you
# can use any IP address, including 10.0.0.2, 192.168.0.1, and others.
VIP = '10.0.0.1'
TEST_CMD = "curl -v -H 'host: whereami.sidecar-example.svc.cluster.local' $VIP "
kubectl exec -it $CLIENT_POD -n sidecar-example -c client -- /bin/sh -c " $TEST_CMD "
The output is similar to:
< Trying 10.0.0.1:80...
< Connected to 10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
< GET / HTTP/1.1
< Host: whereami
< User-Agent: curl/7.82.0-DEV
< Accept: */*
<
< Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< content-type: application/json
< content-length: 318
< access-control-allow-origin: *
< server: envoy
