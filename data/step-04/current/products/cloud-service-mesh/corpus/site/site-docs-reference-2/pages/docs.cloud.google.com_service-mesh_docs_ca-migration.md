Canary-based migration to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority
Note: This guide describes how to migrate from Istio CA to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority with a
canary-based approach that involves minimal or no downtime. To migrate your CA
with minimal downtime and without migrating control-planes, see
In-place CA Migration .
Migrating to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority (Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority) from
Istio CA
(also known as Citadel ) requires migrating the
root of trust .
Prior to Cloud Service Mesh 1.10, if you wanted to migrate from Istio on
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to Cloud Service Mesh with Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, you needed to schedule
downtime because Cloud Service Mesh was not able to load multiple root certificates.
Therefore, during the migration, the newly deployed workloads trust the new
root certificate, while others trust the old root certificate. Workloads using
certificates signed by different root certificates can't authenticate with each
other. This means that mutual TLS (mTLS)
traffic is interrupted during the migration. The entire cluster only fully
recovers when the control plane and all workloads in all namespaces are
redeployed with Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority's certificate. If your mesh has multiple clusters with
workloads that send requests to workloads on another cluster, all workloads on
those clusters need to be updated as well.
Use the steps in this guide for the following use cases:
Migrate from Istio on GKE to the
Cloud Service Mesh 1.19.10-asm.9 in-cluster control plane with Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority.
Upgrade from Cloud Service Mesh 1.15 or a 1.16 patch release with Istio CA to the
Cloud Service Mesh 1.19.10-asm.9 in-cluster control plane with Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority.
Limitations
All GKE clusters must be in the same Google Cloud project.
Prerequisites
Follow the steps in Install dependent tools and validate cluster
to:
Install required tools
Download asmcli
Grant cluster admin permissions
Validate your project and cluster
Required tools
During the migration, you run a Google-provided tool, migrate_ca , to
validate the following for each Pod in the cluster:
The root certificate for Istio CA and Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority.
The workload mTLS certificate issued by Istio CA and by Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority.
The trust domains configured by Istio CA and Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority.
This tool has the following dependencies:
awk
grep
istioctl Running the asmcli install downloads the version of istioctl
that matches the version of Cloud Service Mesh that you are installing.
jq
kubectl
openssl
Overview of the migration
To migrate to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, you follow the
revision-based migration process (also
referred to as a "canary upgrade"). With a revision-based migration, a new
control plane revision is deployed alongside the existing control plane. You
then gradually move your workloads to the new revision, which lets you monitor
the effect of the migration through the process. During the migration process,
authentication and authorization are fully functional between workloads using
the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority and workloads using the Istio CA.
The following is an outline of the migration to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority:
Distribute the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority root of trust.
Install a new control plane revision that uses the Istio CA with an
option that will distribute the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority root of trust.
Migrate workloads to the new control plane, namespace by namespace, and
test your application. When all workloads are successfully migrated to
the new control plane, remove the old control plane.
Migrate to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority. Now that all sidecar proxies are configured with the
old root of trust and the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority root of trust, you can migrate to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority
without downtime. Again, you follow the revision-based migration process:
Install a control plane revision with Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority enabled.
Migrate workloads to the new control plane revision, namespace by
namespace, and test your application. When all workloads are successfully
migrated to the new control plane, remove the old control plane.
Remove CA secrets in the cluster that are associated with the old CA and
restart the new control plane.
Distribute the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority root of trust
Before you can migrate to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, all GKE clusters in the mesh
must have Cloud Service Mesh 1.10 or later, and all clusters must be configured with
a control plane option that triggers the root of trust for Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority to be
distributed to the proxies of all workloads on the cluster. When the
process is finished, each proxy is configured with both the old and the
new root of trusts. With this scheme, when you migrate to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, workloads
using Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority will be able to authenticate with workloads using the old CA.
Install a new control plane revision
Install a control plane revision with an option that distributes the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority
root of trust.
Follow the steps in Install dependent tools and validate cluster
to get ready to use a Google-provided tool, asmcli , to install the new
control plane revision.
Make sure you have the version of asmcli that installs Cloud Service Mesh
1.11 or higher:
./asmcli --version
Run asmcli install . In the following command, replace the placeholders with
your values.
./asmcli install \
--fleet_id FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
--kubeconfig KUBECONFIG_FILE \
--enable_all \
--ca citadel \
--ca_cert CA_CERT_FILE_PATH \
--ca_key CA_KEY_FILE_PATH \
--root_cert ROOT_CERT_FILE_PATH \
--cert_chain CERT_CHAIN_FILE_PATH \
--option ca-migration-citadel \
--revision_name REVISION_1 \
--output_dir DIR_PATH
--fleet_id The project ID of the
fleet host project .
--kubeconfig The path to the
kubeconfig file
You can specify either a relative path or a full path. The environment
variable $PWD doesn't work here.
--output_dir Include this option to specify a directory
where asmcli downloads the anthos-service-mesh
package and extracts the installation file, which
contains, istioctl , samples, and manifests. Otherwise
asmcli downloads the files to a tmp directory.
You can specify either a relative path or a full path. The environment
variable $PWD doesn't work here.
--enable_all Allows the tool to:
Grant required IAM permissions.
Enable the required Google APIs.
Set a label on the cluster that identifies the mesh.
Register the cluster to the fleet if it isn't already registered.
-ca citadel To avoid downtime, specify Istio CA (the `citadel`
option corresponds to Istio CA). Don't switch to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority at this point.
--ca_cert The intermediate certificate.
--ca_key The key for the intermediate certificate
--root_cert The root certificate.
--cert_chain The certificate chain.
--option ca-migration-citadel When you
redeploy your workloads ,
this option triggers the new root of trust to be distributed to the
sidecar proxies of the workloads.
REVISION_1 : Recommended. A
revision label is a key-value pair
that is set on the control plane. The revision label key is always
istio.io/rev . By default, the tool sets the value for the
revision label based on the Cloud Service Mesh version, for example:
asm-11910-9 . We recommend that you include this
option and replace REVISION_1 with a name
that describes the installation, such as asm-11910-9-distribute-root .
The name must be a DNS-1035 label, and it must consist of lower case
alphanumeric characters or - , start with an alphabetic
character, and end with an alphanumeric character (such as
my-name or abc-123 ).
Migrate workloads to the new control plane
To finish distributing the new root of trust, you need to label your
namespaces with the revision label
istio.io/rev=<var>REVISION_1</var>-distribute-root and restart your
workloads. When testing your workloads after restarting them, you run a tool
to validate that the sidecar proxy is configured with both the old and new root
of trust for Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority.
Set the current context for kubectl . In the following command, change
--region to --zone if you have a single-zone cluster.
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--region= CLUSTER_LOCATION
Download the validation tool:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-service-mesh-packages/master/scripts/ca-migration/migrate_ca > migrate_ca
Set the executable bit on the tool:
chmod +x migrate_ca
The migrate_ca tool calls istioctl , which is version dependent. The
asmcli tool adds a symlink to istioctl in the directory you
specified for --output_dir . Make sure that directory is at the
beginning of your path. In the following command, replace
ISTIOCTL_PATH with the directory that contains
istioctl that the tool downloaded.
export PATH= ISTIOCTL_PATH :$PATH
which istioctl
echo $PATH
Get the revision label that is on istiod and the istio-ingressgateway .
kubectl get pod -n istio-system -L istio.io/rev
The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE REV
istio-ingressgateway-5fd454f8ff-t7w9x 1/1 Running 0 36m default
istio-ingressgateway-asm-195-2-distribute-root-c6ccfbdbd-z2s9p 1/1 Running 0 18m asm-195-2-distribute-root
istio-ingressgateway-asm-195-2-distribute-root-c6ccfbdbd-zr2cs 1/1 Running 0 18m asm-195-2-distribute-root
istiod-68bc495f77-shl2h 1/1 Running 0 36m default
istiod-asm-195-2-distribute-root-6f764dbb7c-g9f8c 1/1 Running 0 18m asm-195-2-distribute-root
istiod-asm-195-2-distribute-root-6f764dbb7c-z7z9s 1/1 Running 0 18m asm-195-2-distribute-root
In the output, under the REV column, note the value of the revision
label for the new revision, which matches the revision label that you
specified when you ran asmcli install . In this example, the value is
asm-11910-9-distribute-root .
You need to delete the old revision of istiod when you finish moving
workloads to the new revision. Note the value in the revision label for
the old istiod revision. The example output shows a migration from
Istio, which is using the default revision.
Add the revision label to a namespace and remove the istio-injection
label (if it exists). In the following command, replace
NAMESPACE with the namespace to label.
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio.io/rev= REVISION_1 istio-injection- --overwrite
If you see "istio-injection not found" in the output, you can
ignore it. That means that the namespace didn't previously have the
istio-injection label. Because auto-injection behavior is
undefined when a namespace has both the istio-injection and the
revision label, all kubectl label commands in the Cloud Service Mesh
documentation explicitly ensure that only one is set.
Restart the Pods to trigger re-injection.
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n NAMESPACE
Test your application to verify that the workloads are working correctly.
If you have workloads in other namespaces, repeat the steps to label the
namespace and restart Pods.
Validate that the sidecar proxies for all workloads on the cluster are
configured with both the old and new root certificates:
./migrate_ca check-root-cert
Expected output:
Namespace: foo
httpbin-66cdbdb6c5-pmzps.foo trusts [CITADEL MESHCA]
sleep-64d7d56698-6tmjm.foo trusts [CITADEL MESHCA]
If you need to migrate gateways, follow the steps in Canary Upgrades (advanced)
to install new gateway deployments. Keep the following points in mind:
Use REVISION_1 as the revision label.
Deploy the gateway resources in the same namespace as the gateway from the
older installation to perform zero-downtime migration . Ensure that the
service resources pointing to the older gateway should include the newer
deployments now as well.
Don't delete the older gateway deployments until you are sure your
application is working properly (after the next step).
If you are satisfied that your application is working as expected, continue
with the steps to transition to the new version of istiod . If there's an
issue with your application, follow the steps to rollback.
Complete the transition
If you are satisfied that your application is working as expected, remove
the old control plane to complete the transition to the new version.
Change to the directory where the files from the anthos-service-mesh
GitHub repository are located.
Configure the validating webhook to use the new control plane.
kubectl apply -f asm/istio/istiod-service.yaml
Delete the old istio-ingressgateway Deployment. The command that you
run depends on whether you are migrating from Istio or upgrading
from a previous version of Cloud Service Mesh:
Migrate
If you migrated from Istio, the old istio-ingressgateway doesn't
have a revision label.
kubectl delete deploy/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
Upgrade
If you upgraded from a previous Cloud Service Mesh version, in the
following command, replace OLD_REVISION with the
revision label for the previous version of the
istio-ingressgateway .
kubectl delete deploy -l app=istio-ingressgateway,istio.io/rev= OLD_REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Delete the old revision of istiod . The command that you use depends
on whether you are migrating from Istio or upgrading from a previous
version of Cloud Service Mesh.
Migrate
If you migrated from Istio, the old istio-ingressgateway doesn't
have a revision label.
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Upgrade
If you upgraded from a previous Cloud Service Mesh version, in the
following command, make sure that OLD_REVISION
matches the revision label for the previous version of istiod .
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod- OLD_REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Remove the earlier version of the IstioOperator configuration.
kubectl delete IstioOperator installed-state- OLD_REVISION -n istio-system
The expected output is similar to the following:
istiooperator.install.istio.io "installed-state- OLD_REVISION " deleted
Rollback
If you encountered an issue when testing your application with the new
version of istiod , follow these steps to rollback to the previous
version:
Delete the new gateway deployments installed as part of step 11.
Relabel your namespace to enable auto-injection with the previous
version of istiod . The command that you use depends on whether you
used a revision label or istio-injection=enabled with the previous
version.
If you used a revision label for auto-injection:
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio.io/rev= OLD_REVISION --overwrite
If you used istio-injection=enabled :
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio.io/rev- istio-injection=enabled --overwrite
Expected output:
namespace/ NAMESPACE labeled
Confirm that the revision label on the namespace matches the revision
label on the previous version of istiod :
kubectl get ns NAMESPACE --show-labels
Restart the Pods to trigger re-injection so the proxies have the previous
version:
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n NAMESPACE
Remove the new istio-ingressgateway Deployment.
kubectl delete deploy -l app=istio-ingressgateway,istio.io/rev= REVISION_1 -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Remove the new revision of istiod .
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod- REVISION_1 -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Remove the new IstioOperator configuration.
kubectl delete IstioOperator installed-state-asm-11910-9-distribute-root -n istio-system
Expected output is similar to the following:
istiooperator.install.istio.io "installed-state-asm-11910-9-distribute-root" deleted
Migrate to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority
Now that the sidecar proxies for all workloads are configured with both the old
root of trust and the new root of trust for Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority, the steps to
migrate to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority are similar to those that you did to distribute
the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority root of trust:
Install a new control plane with Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority enabled
You use asmcli install to install a new control plane revision that has Mesh
CA enabled.
If you customized the previous installation, you need to specify the
same
overlay files
when you run asmcli install .
Run asmcli install . In the following command, replace the placeholders
with your values.
./asmcli install \
--fleet_id FLEET_PROJECT_ID \
--kubeconfig KUBECONFIG_FILE \
--output_dir DIR_PATH \
--enable_all \
--ca mesh_ca \
--option ca-migration-meshca \
--revision_name REVISION_2 \
OVERLAYS
--fleet_id The project ID of the
fleet host project .
--kubeconfig The path to the
kubeconfig file
You can specify either a relative path or a full path. The environment
variable $PWD doesn't work here.
--output_dir Include this option to specify a directory
where asmcli downloads the anthos-service-mesh
package and extracts the installation file, which
contains istioctl , samples, and manifests. Otherwise
asmcli downloads the files to a tmp directory.
You can specify either a relative path or a full path. The environment
variable $PWD doesn't work here.
--enable_all Allows the tool to:
Grant required IAM permissions.
Enable the required Google APIs.
Set a label on the cluster that identifies the mesh.
Register the cluster to the fleet if it isn't already registered.
--ca mesh_ca You can now switch to Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority since the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority
root of trust has been distributed.
REVISION_2 Recommended. Replace
REVISION_2 with a name that describes the
installation, such as asm-11910-9-meshca-ca-migration .
The name must be a DNS-1035 label, and it must consist of lower case
alphanumeric characters or - , start with an alphabetic
character, and end with an alphanumeric character (such as
my-name or abc-123 ).
--option ca-migration-migration When you
[redeploy your workloads](/service-mesh/docs/unified-install/install-anthos-service-mesh#deploy_and_redeploy_workloads),
this option configures the proxies to use the Cloud Service Mesh certificate authority root of trust.
Migrate workloads to the new control plane
To finish the installation, you need to label your namespaces with the new
revision label and restart your workloads.
Get the revision label that is on istiod and the istio-ingressgateway .
kubectl get pod -n istio-system -L istio.io/rev
The output is similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE REV
istio-ingressgateway-asm-11910-9-distribute-root-65d884685d-6hrdk 1/1 Running 0 67m asm-11910-9-distribute-root

istiod-asm-11910-9-meshca-ca-migration-5cd96f88f6-wm68b 1/1 Running 0 27s asm-11910-9-meshca-ca-migration
In the output, under the REV column, note the value of the revision
label for the new version. In this example, the value is
asm-11910-9-meshca-ca-migration .
Also note the value in the revision label for the earlier istiod version.
You need this to delete the earlier version of istiod when you finish
moving workloads to the new version. In the example, the value of the
revision label for the previous revision is
asm-11910-9-distribute-root .
Add the new revision label to a namespace In the following command,
replace NAMESPACE with the namespace to label.
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio.io/rev= REVISION_2 --overwrite
Restart the Pods to trigger re-injection.
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n NAMESPACE
Test your application to verify that the workloads are working correctly.
Make sure that mTLS communication works between workloads in the older
namespace and workloads in the newer namespace.
If you have workloads in other namespaces, repeat the steps to label the
namespace and restart Pods.
Follow the steps outlined in In-place upgrades
to upgrade the older gateway deployments installed in step 11 of the
previous section to the
latest revision REVISION_2 .
If you are satisfied that your application is working as expected, continue
with the steps to transition to the new control plane. If there's an
issue with your application, follow the steps to rollback.
Complete the transition
If you are satisfied that your application is working as expected, remove
the old control plane to complete the transition to the new version.
Change to the directory where the files from the anthos-service-mesh
GitHub repository are located.
Configure the validating webhook to use the new control plane.
kubectl apply -f asm/istio/istiod-service.yaml
Delete the old istio-ingressgateway Deployment. In the following
command, replace OLD_REVISION with the revision
label for the previous version of the istio-ingressgateway .
kubectl delete deploy -l app=istio-ingressgateway,istio.io/rev= OLD_REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Delete the old istiod revision. In the following command, replace
OLD_REVISION with the revision label for the
previous version of istiod .
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod- OLD_REVISION -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Remove the old IstioOperator configuration.
kubectl delete IstioOperator installed-state- OLD_REVISION -n istio-system
The expected output is similar to the following:
istiooperator.install.istio.io "installed-state- OLD_REVISION " deleted
Rollback
If you encountered an issue when testing your application with the new
istiod revision, follow these steps to rollback to the previous
revision:
Follow the steps in In-place upgrades
to downgrade the gateway deployments previously upgraded in
step 6 of this section
to the older revision REVISION_1 .
Relabel your namespace to enable auto-injection with the previous
istiod revision.
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE istio.io/rev= OLD_REVISION --overwrite
Expected output:
namespace/ NAMESPACE labeled
Confirm that the revision label on the namespace matches the revision
label on the previous version of istiod :
kubectl get ns NAMESPACE --show-labels
Restart the Pods to trigger re-injection so the proxies have the previous
version:
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n NAMESPACE
Remove the new istio-ingressgateway Deployment.
kubectl delete deploy -l app=istio-ingressgateway,istio.io/rev= REVISION_2 -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Remove the new version of istiod . Make sure that the revision label
in the following command matches your revision.
kubectl delete Service,Deployment,HorizontalPodAutoscaler,PodDisruptionBudget istiod- REVISION_2 -n istio-system --ignore-not-found=true
Remove the new version of the IstioOperator configuration.
kubectl delete IstioOperator installed-state- REVISION_2 -n istio-system
Expected output is similar to the following:
istiooperator.install.istio.io "installed-state- REVISION_2 " deleted
Remove the CA secrets and restart the new control plane
Preserve secrets just in case you need them:
kubectl get secret/cacerts -n istio-system -o yaml > save_file_1
Remove the CA secrets in the cluster associated with the old CA:
kubectl delete secret cacerts -n istio-system --ignore-not-found
Restart the newly installed control plane. This makes sure the old root of
trust is cleaned up from all workloads running in the mesh.
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n istio-system
