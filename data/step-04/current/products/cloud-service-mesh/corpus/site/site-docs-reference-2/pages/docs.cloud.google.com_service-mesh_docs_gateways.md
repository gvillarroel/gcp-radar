Installing and upgrading gateways with Istio APIs
Note: This guide only supports Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs and does
not support Google Cloud APIs. For more information see,
Cloud Service Mesh overview .
Cloud Service Mesh gives you the option to deploy and manage gateways as part of
your service mesh. A gateway describes a load balancer that operates at the edge
of the mesh and receives incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections. Gateways are
primarily used to manage ingress traffic, but you can also configure gateways to
manage other types of traffic.
Egress gateways: An egress gateway lets you configure a dedicated exit node
for traffic leaving the mesh, letting you limit which services can or should
access external networks, or to enable secure control of egress traffic to add
security to your mesh, for example.
Ingress gateways: An ingress gateway lets you configure a dedicated entrance
node to receive incoming HTTP/TCP connections.
East-west gateways: A proxy for
east-west
traffic to allow service workloads to communicate across cluster boundaries in
a multi-primary mesh on different networks. By default, this gateway will be
public on the Internet.
This page describes best practices for deploying and upgrading the gateway
proxies as well as examples of configuring your own istio-ingressgateway and
istio-egressgateway gateway proxies.
You can deploy gateways in different ways and you can use more than
one topology within the same cluster. Refer to
Gateway deployment topologies
in the Istio documentation to learn more about these topologies.
Best practices for deploying gateways
The best practices for deploying gateways depend on whether you are using the
managed data plane or the
unmanaged data plane .
Best practices for managed data plane
Enable the
managed data plane .
Add a managed revision label to a
namespace.
Deploy and manage the control plane and gateways separately.
As a security best practice, deploy gateways in
a different namespace from the control plane.
Use
automatic sidecar injection
(auto-injection) to inject the proxy configuration for the gateways similar
to how you would inject the sidecar proxies for your services.
These best practices:
Ensure your managed gateways are automatically kept up-to-date with the latest
enhancements and security updates.
Offloads management and maintenance of gateway instances to Cloud Service Mesh
managed data plane.
Best practices for unmanaged data plane
Deploy and manage the control plane and gateways separately.
As a security best practice, deploy gateways in
a different namespace from the control plane.
Use
automatic sidecar injection
(auto-injection) to inject the proxy configuration for the gateways similar
to how you would inject the sidecar proxies for your services.
These best practices:
Let your namespace administrators manage gateways without needing
elevated privileges to your entire cluster.
Let your administrators use the same deployment tooling or mechanism
that they use to manage Kubernetes applications to deploy and manage
gateways.
Give administrators full control over the gateway Deployment, and also
simplify operations. When a new upgrade is available or a configuration
has changed, administrators update gateway Pods by restarting them. This
makes the experience of operating a gateway Deployment the same as
operating sidecar proxies for your services.
Deploy sample gateway
To support users with existing deployment tools, Cloud Service Mesh supports the
same ways to deploy a gateway as
Istio :
IstioOperator , Helm, and Kubernetes YAML. Each method produces the same
result. Although you can choose the method you are most familiar with, we
recommend that you use the Kubernetes YAML method because it is easier to modify
and you can store hydrated manifests in source control.
The following steps show how to deploy a sample gateway.
Create a namespace for the gateway if you don't already have one.
Replace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE with the name of your
namespace.
kubectl create namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
Enable the namespace for injection. The steps depend on your control plane implementation .
Managed (TD)
Apply the default injection label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
Managed (Istiod)
Recommended: Run the following command to apply the default injection label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
If you are an existing user with the Managed Istiod control plane:
We recommend that you use default injection, but revision-based injection is
supported. Use the following instructions:
Run the following command to locate the available release channels:
kubectl -n istio-system get controlplanerevision
The output is similar to the following:
NAME AGE
asm-managed-rapid 6d7h
NOTE: If two control plane revisions appear in the list above, remove one. Having multiple control plane channels in the cluster is not supported.
In the output, the value under the NAME column is the revision label that corresponds to the available release channel for the Cloud Service Mesh version.
Apply the revision label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE \
istio-injection- istio.io/rev = REVISION_LABEL --overwrite
In-cluster
Recommended: Run the following command to apply the default injection label to the namespace:
kubectl label namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE \
istio.io/rev- istio-injection = enabled --overwrite
We recommend that you use default injection, but revision-based injection is supported:
Use the following instructions:
Use the following command to locate the revision label on istiod :
kubectl get deploy -n istio-system -l app = istiod -o \
jsonpath ={ .items [ * ] .metadata.labels. 'istio\.io\/rev' } '{"\n"}'
Apply the revision label to the namespace. In the following command,
REVISION_LABEL is the value of the istiod revision
label that you noted in the previous step.
kubectl label namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE \
istio-injection- istio.io/rev = REVISION_LABEL --overwrite
Copy the configuration files for the sample gateways from the
anthos-service-mesh repository .
Change your directory to the samples directory. To ensure you are in the
correct directory, run the ls command to list the directory contents and
then confirm there is a gateways directory (which you will access in the
next step) and an online-boutique directory.
Deploy an ingress or egress gateway. These are located in the
samples/gateways/ directory as is, or modify it as needed.
Ingress
kubectl apply -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE -f samples/gateways/istio-ingressgateway
Egress
kubectl apply -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE -f samples/gateways/istio-egressgateway
After you create the deployment, verify that the new services are working
correctly:
kubectl get pod,service -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
Verify that the output is similar to the following:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
pod/istio-ingressgateway-856b7c77-bdb77 1/1 Running 0 3s
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
service/istio-ingressgateway LoadBalancer 10.24.5.129 34.82.157.6 80:31904/TCP 3s
Manage gateway resources like any other Kubernetes application. The samples in
the anthos-service-mesh-packages repository are meant for guidance and a
quickstart. Customize them according to your needs.
Gateway selectors
You apply a
Gateway
configuration to the istio-ingressgateway and istio-egressgateway proxies to
manage inbound and outbound traffic for your mesh, letting you specify which
traffic you want to enter or leave the mesh. The labels on a gateway
deployment's Pods are used by Gateway configuration resources, so it's important
that your Gateway selector matches these labels.
For example, in the preceding deployments, the istio=ingressgateway label is set
on the gateway Pods. To apply a Gateway configuration to these deployments, you
need to select the same label:
apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind : Gateway
metadata :
name : gateway
spec :
selector :
istio : ingressgateway
...
For an example of a Gateway configuration and Virtual Service,
see frontend.yaml
in the Online Boutique sample application.
Upgrade gateways
In-place upgrades
For most use cases, you should upgrade your gateways following the in-place
upgrade pattern. Because gateways utilize Pod injection, new gateway Pods that
are created will automatically be injected with the latest configuration, which
includes the version.
If you would like to change the control plane revision in use by the gateway,
you can set the istio.io/rev label on the gateway Deployment, which will also
trigger a rolling restart.
Managed control plane
Since Google manages the control plane upgrades for the managed control plane,
you can simply restart the gateway Deployment and the new pods will
automatically be injected with the latest configuration and version.
kubectl rollout restart deployment istio-ingressgateway \
-n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
In-cluster control plane
To apply the same pattern to your gateways when you have the in-cluster control
plane, you will need to change the control plane revision in use by the gateway.
Set the istio.io/rev label on the gateway Deployment which will trigger a
rolling restart. The steps required depend on whether you need to update the
revision label on namespace and/or the gateway pod.
If you labeled the namespace for injection, set the istio.io/rev label on
the namespace to the new revision value:
kubectl label namespace GATEWAY_NAMESPACE \
istio-injection- istio.io/rev= REVISION \
--overwrite
If you enabled injection only for the gateway pod, set the istio.io/rev
label on the Deployment to the new revision value like the following
Kubernetes YAML file:
cat <<EOF > gateway-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: istio-ingressgateway
namespace: GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
istio: ingressgateway
template:
metadata:
annotations:
# This is required to tell Cloud Service Mesh to inject the gateway with the
# required configuration.
inject.istio.io/templates: gateway
labels:
istio: ingressgateway
istio.io/rev: REVISION
spec:
containers:
- name: istio-proxy
image: auto # The image will automatically update each time the pod starts.
EOF
kubectl apply -f gateway-deployment.yaml
Note: If the image does not automatically update with the actual
Cloud Service Mesh proxy image, then the container will not be found and an error
will occur. See Troubleshoot gateways for next
steps.
Canary upgrades (advanced)
If you are using the in-cluster control plane and would like to more slowly
control the rollout of a new control plane revision, you can follow the canary
upgrade pattern. You can run multiple versions of a gateway Deployment and
ensure everything works as expected with a subset of your traffic. For example,
if you want to roll out a new revision, canary, create a copy of your gateway
Deployment with the istio.io/rev= REVISION label set to the
new revision and a new name, for example istio-ingressgateway-canary :
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : istio-ingressgateway-canary
namespace : GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
spec :
selector :
matchLabels :
istio : ingressgateway
template :
metadata :
annotations :
inject.istio.io/templates : gateway
labels :
istio : ingressgateway
istio.io/rev : REVISION # Set to the control plane revision you want to deploy
spec :
containers :
- name : istio-proxy
image : auto
Note: If the image does not automatically update with the actual Cloud Service Mesh
proxy image, then the container will not be found and an error will occur. See
Troubleshoot gateways for next steps.
When this Deployment is created, you will then have two versions of the
gateway, both selected by the same Service:
kubectl get endpoints -o
"custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,PODS:.subsets[*].addresses[*].targetRef.name"
NAME PODS
istio-ingressgateway istio-ingressgateway-788854c955-8gv96,istio-ingressgateway-canary-b78944cbd-mq2qf
Note: Unlike application services deployed inside the mesh, you cannot use
Istio traffic shifting to distribute the traffic between the gateway versions
because their traffic is coming directly from external clients that Istio does
not control. Instead, you can control the distribution of traffic by the number
of replicas of each Deployment. If you use another load balancer in front of
Istio, you may also use that to control the traffic distribution.
If you are satisfied that your applications are working as expected, run this
command to transition to the new version by deleting the Deployment with the old
istio.io/rev label set:
kubectl delete deploy/istio-ingressgateway -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
If you encountered an issue when testing your application with the new version
of the gateway, run this command to transition back to the old version by
deleting the Deployment with the new istio.io/rev label set:
kubectl delete deploy/istio-ingressgateway-canary -n GATEWAY_NAMESPACE
Advanced configuration
Deploying Gateways that terminate TLS traffic
Refer to Set up TLS termination in ingress gateway document for more details.
Configure gateway minimum TLS version
For Cloud Service Mesh, the default minimum TLS version for gateway servers is 1.2.
You can configure the minimum TLS version using the minProtocolVersion field.
For more information, see
ServerTLSSettings .
Unsupported features
If you have TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR
control plane implementation then
the following fields or values in Gateway are not supported:
ServerTLSSettings.TLSmode with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH value
ServerTLSSettings.verifyCertificateSpki
ServerTLSSettings.verifyCertificateHash
Troubleshoot gateways
Failed to update gateway image from auto
When you deploy or upgrade a gateway, Cloud Service Mesh inserts auto as a
placeholder in the image field. After the call to a mutating webhook,
Cloud Service Mesh automatically replaces this placeholder with the actual
Cloud Service Mesh proxy image. If the call to the mutating webhook fails, the auto
placeholder remains, and the container is not found. This is typically
caused by an incorrect namespace label. Ensure that you configured the correct
namespace and then deploy or upgrade the gateway again.
