Cloud Run API reference
Preview
This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Note: This guide only supports Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs and does
not support Google Cloud APIs. For more information see,
Cloud Service Mesh overview .
This page provides a reference for the APIs that are used to configure
Cloud Service Mesh for Cloud Run workloads.
Cloud Run API
v1 API
Cloud Service Mesh is enabled using a Revision level annotation .
The value of this annotation is the backing mesh name of the
Cloud Service Mesh Istio cluster.
Annotation
Value
run.googleapis.com/mesh
projects/ PROJECT /locations/global/meshes/ MESH
v2 API
Cloud Service Mesh is enabled using the serviceMesh field in the
Service resource
Cloud Service Mesh Istio API
VirtualService API
Field Name
Type
Field Description
gateways
String []
If the gateways include an "external-mesh" then the virtual service applies to only non-GKE workloads.
If "mesh" is specified along with "external-mesh", the virtual service will apply to both non-GKE and GKE workloads.
exportTo
string
Considering that non-GKE workloads have no concept of a namespace, "external-mesh" virtual services will ignore the exportTo field.
However, they will continue to work for virtual services that have "mesh" or gateways will continue to work as expected for GKE workloads.
httpRoute.HTTPMatchRequest.SourceLabels
map
Will be ignored for "external-mesh" virtual services.
However, they will continue to work for virtual services that have "mesh" or gateways will continue to work as expected for GKE workloads.
httpRoute.HTTPMatchRequest.SourceNamespace
string
Will be ignored for "external-mesh" virtual services.
However, they will continue to work for virtual services that have "mesh" or gateways will continue to work as expected for GKE workloads.
httpRoute.HTTPMatchRequest.Gateways
string[]
Will be ignored for "external-mesh" virtual services.
However, they will continue to work for virtual services that have "mesh" or gateways will continue to work as expected for GKE workloads.
tls
tlsRoute[]
Will be ignored for "external-mesh" virtual services.
However, they will continue to work for virtual services that have "mesh" or gateways will continue to work as expected for GKE workloads.
tcp
tcpRoute[]
Will be ignored for external-mesh virtual service.
However, they will continue to work for virtual services that have "mesh" or gateways will continue to work as expected for GKE workloads.
Istio Auto MTLS and Secure Naming
Currently, Cloud Service Mesh supports Automatic Istio MutualTLS and Secure
Naming for requests between GKE Services.
For Preview, non-GKE workloads communicating with
GKE workloads/services will not use Istio Auto MTLS nor Secure
Naming. The traffic will be in plain text. Make sure that GKE
Services have a permissive MTLS policy (which is the Istio API default) which
accepts MTLS traffic from GKE workloads and plain text from
non-GKE workloads.
Use the following command to check if PeerAuthentication is in permissive mode:
# list PeerAuthentication resources in a namespace
# If no PeerAuthentication resource exists in the namespace,
# then it's PERMISSIVE mode (Istio API default)
kubectl get PeerAuthentication -n $NAMESPACE
# for each of the above run the following command
kubectl get PeerAuthentication $PEER -AUTHN -n $NAMESPACE
# Expected Output is as follows:
# MTLS Mode must be PERMISSIVE.
# If the output says STRICT, then please update the policy to PERMISSIVE.
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
name: $PEER -AUTHN
namespace: $NAMESPACE
spec:
mtls:
mode: PERMISSIVE
MeshConfig Telemetry
Cloud Service Mesh supports MeshConfig telemetry API to enable and disable
Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring for GKE workloads.
This will work similarly for non-GKE workloads as well.
Destination Rule
For Preview, DestinationRule targeting the "external-mesh" virtual services
will be supported except following fields: trafficPolicy.tls
Sidecar API
Sidecar API will not be applicable to non-GKE workloads.
Non-GKE workloads will be able to see all the virtual services
scoped to "external-mesh" without being filtered by any Sidecar visibility rules.
Security API - Authorization Policy, Request Authentication Policy
These will not apply to non-GKE workloads which act as Clients
sending outbound traffic. They will continue to apply GKE
workloads that receive inbound traffic.
GCPBackend API
Note: This is a Kubernetes Custom Resource.
Field Name
Type
Field Description
GCPBackend
struct
Schema for the GCPBackend resource.
TypeMeta
metav1.TypeMeta
Embedded struct for storing metadata information like kind and API version.
ObjectMeta
metav1.ObjectMeta
Embedded struct for storing metadata information like name, namespace, labels, annotations, etc.
Spec
GCPBackendSpec
Specification for the GCPBackend resource, defining its desired state.
GCPBackendSpec
struct
Defines the desired state of the GRPCRoute.
CloudRun
*CloudRunBackend
Defines a backend running in CloudRun (optional).
CloudRunBackend
struct
Identifies a service running on Cloud Run.
Service
string
CloudRun service name. Must be between 1 and 49 characters, follow a specific pattern, and consist only of lowercase letters, hyphens, and numbers.
Regions
[]Region
Regions of the CloudRun service. Exactly one region must be provided.
Project
string
Project ID of the CloudRun service. Defaults to the same project as the GKE cluster. Must be between 6 and 30 characters and follow a specific pattern. Currently, Cloud Run Service and the GKE Cluster must be in the same project.
GCPBackendList
struct
Contains a list of GCPBackends.
Items
[]*GCPBackend
Array of GCPBackend pointers representing the list of GCPBackend resources.
ListMeta
metav1.ListMeta
Embedded struct for storing list metadata information like resource version and continue token for pagination.
