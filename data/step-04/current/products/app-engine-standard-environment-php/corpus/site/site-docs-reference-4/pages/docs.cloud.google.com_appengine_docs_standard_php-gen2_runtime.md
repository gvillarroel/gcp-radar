PHP runtime environment
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The PHP runtime is the software stack responsible for installing
your web service's code and its dependencies and running your service.
To specify PHP for the App Engine standard environment, declare the runtime in the
app.yaml
file. For example:
runtime : php VERSION
Where VERSION is the PHP MAJOR and MINOR version numbers. For example,
to use the latest PHP version, PHP 8.5, specify
85 .
For other supported PHP versions, and the corresponding Ubuntu version for your
PHP version, see the Runtime support schedule .
PHP version
The latest supported PHP version is 8.5. The PHP runtime uses the latest stable release of the version that is specified
in your app.yaml file. App Engine automatically updates to new patch
release versions, but will not automatically update the minor version.
For example, your app might be deployed at PHP 7.3.0 and later automatically
updated to version 7.3.1, but it will not be automatically updated to PHP 7.4.0.
Note: If you have a required PHP version specified in your composer.json file,
you will have to remove the element for a successful deployment.
App startup
You will need to deploy a front controller
to handle all request routing.
The following examples show different ways to serve your app:
If your app contains a public/index.php or index.php file,
App Engine uses this file to serve your app.
We recommend you use a framework, such as Laravel, Symfony, or
Slim ,
because it provides lightweight routing for writing and deploying PHP
apps quickly. See an example Slim front controller .
However, if you are migrating a legacy app, see the following
sample index.php file to import the PHP files you need and implement the
front controller manually:
switch (@parse_url($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])['path']) {
case '/':
require 'homepage.php';
break;
case '/contact.php':
require 'contact.php';
break;
default:
http_response_code(404);
exit('Not Found');
}
If you specify the optional entrypoint element in your app.yaml file,
App Engine uses the command in the entrypoint element to serve your
app instead of using public/index.php or index.php :
entrypoint: serve path/to/my/front/controller.php
The entrypoint field uses the built-in serve command, which is a program
within the PHP runtimes that starts up the php-fpm implementation and a
webserver in the background. This webserver routes all traffic to the
provided PHP file using the front controller design pattern.
The serve command has two optional flags:
--workers=N : specifies the N number of php-fpm workers. If you don't
set the --workers flag, the serve command guesses the number of
workers based on the amount of memory available. For best
results, set the values for the --workers flag on the serve command
and the max_concurrent_requests element to be the same number.
--enable-dynamic-workers : specifies that you'd like the php-fpm
workers to be spawned only as needed. The default is to use a static
policy for the php-fpm workers. You can change the number maximum
number of spawned workers by using the --workers=N flag. By default
the maximum number of spawned workers defaults to that set by the static
policy.
The optional flags must come before the front controller path:
entrypoint: serve --workers=2 --enable-dynamic-workers path/to/index.php
You can deploy a long-running worker process by setting the entrypoint
element to the filepath of the worker process:
entrypoint: php long-running-worker-file.php
If the entrypoint element executes a script with a long-running process,
such as a Pub/Sub Worker subscribed to a topic, do not use the serve
command.
For more information, see the
app.yaml reference .

extension=opencensus.so
extension=redis.so
[opentelemetry]
extension=opentelemetry.so
Environment variables
The following environment variables are set by the runtime:
Environment variable
Description
GAE_APPLICATION
The ID of your App Engine application.
This ID is prefixed with ' region code ~'
such as 'e~' for applications deployed in Europe.
GAE_DEPLOYMENT_ID
The ID of the current deployment.
GAE_ENV
The App Engine environment. Set to standard .
GAE_INSTANCE
The ID of the instance on which your service is currently running.
GAE_MEMORY_MB
The amount of memory available to the application process, in MB.
GAE_RUNTIME
The runtime specified in your app.yaml file.
GAE_SERVICE
The service name specified in your app.yaml file. If no service name is specified, it is set to default .
GAE_VERSION
The current version label of your service.
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
The Google Cloud project ID associated with your application.
PORT
The port that receives HTTP requests.
NODE_ENV (Only available in the Node.js runtime)
Set to production when your service is deployed.
You can
define additional environment variables in your app.yaml file ,
but the above values cannot be overridden, except for NODE_ENV .
HTTPS and forwarding proxies
App Engine terminates HTTPS connections at the load balancer and
forwards requests to your application. Some applications need to determine
the original request IP and protocol. The user's IP address is available in
the standard X-Forwarded-For header. Applications that require this
information should configure their web framework to trust the proxy.
Filesystem
The runtime includes a writable /tmp directory, with all other directories
having read-only access. Writing to /tmp takes up system memory. For more
information, see tempnam() and sys_get_temp_dir() support .
Metadata server
Each instance of your application can use the App Engine metadata server
to query information about the instance and your project.
Note: Custom metadata is not supported in the standard environment.
You can access the metadata server through the following endpoints:
http://metadata
http://metadata.google.internal
Requests sent to the metadata server must include the request header
Metadata-Flavor: Google . This header indicates that the request was sent with
the intention of retrieving metadata values.
The following table lists the endpoints where you can make HTTP requests for
specific metadata:
Metadata endpoint
Description
/computeMetadata/v1/project/numeric-project-id
The project number assigned to your project.
/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id
The project ID assigned to your project.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/region
The region the instance is running in.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/aliases
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/email
The default service account email assigned to your project.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/
Lists all the default service accounts for your project.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/scopes
Lists all the supported scopes for the default service accounts.
/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token
Returns the auth token that can be used to authenticate your application to other Google Cloud APIs.
For example, to retrieve your project ID, send a request to
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id .
The following is an example of how to call the metadata endpoints using cURL or
the Google Cloud Client Library:
/**
* Requests a key from the Metadata server using the Google Cloud SDK. Install
* the Google Cloud SDK by running "composer install google/cloud"
*
* @param $metadataKey the key for the metadata server
*/
function request_metadata_using_google_cloud($metadataKey)
{
$metadata = new Google\Cloud\Core\Compute\Metadata();
$metadataValue = $metadata->get($metadataKey);
return $metadataValue;
}
/**
* Requests a key from the Metadata server using cURL.
*
* @param $metadataKey the key for the metadata server
*/
function request_metadata_using_curl($metadataKey)
{
$url = 'http://metadata/computeMetadata/v1/' . $metadataKey;
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Metadata-Flavor: Google'));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);
return curl_exec($ch);
}
Sessions
PHP provides a session management layer that allows web apps to preserve
user-state information between requests. Sessions in App Engine work
much like sessions in any other PHP app.
To set a variable in a user's session, you can use the following code:
session_start();
$_SESSION['Foo'] = 'Bar';
The following code will print Bar , on a subsequent request by the same user:
session_start();
print $_SESSION['Foo']; // prints Bar
For longer-lived sessions, use an alternative storage service such as
Cloud SQL .
Special $_SERVER keys
PHP makes the special $_SERVER[] array available in the request scope. In
addition to the standard CGI parameters, App Engine adds some additional
useful keys:
GAE_APPLICATION - Current app's Google Cloud project ID.
GAE_DEPLOYMENT_ID - Deployed source code's ID.
GAE_ENV - The App Engine environment (standard or flexible) where your
app runs.
GAE_INSTANCE - Current executing instance name.
GAE_MEMORY_MB - Amount of memory available to the app process, in
MB.
GAE_RUNTIME - The runtime specified in your app.yaml file, such as
php72.
GAE_SERVICE - Currently deployed service name.
GAE_VERSION - Currently deployed version name.
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT - Google Cloud project ID.
HTTP_X_APPENGINE_CITY - Name of the city from which the request originated.
For example, a request from the city of Mountain View might have the header
value mountain view.
HTTP_X_APPENGINE_CITYLATLONG - Latitude and longitude of the city from which
the request originated. This string might look like "37.386051,-122.083851"
for a request from Mountain View.
HTTP_X_APPENGINE_COUNTRY - Country from which the request originated, as an
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. App Engine determines this code from
the client's IP address.
HTTP_X_APPENGINE_HTTPS - Verifies HTTPS usage.
HTTP_X_APPENGINE_REGION - Name of the region from which the request
originated. This value only makes sense in the context of the country in
X-Appengine-Country . For example, if the country is "US" and the region is
"ca", that "ca" means "California", not Canada.
HTTP_X_APPENGINE_USER_IP - Client's IP address. Note that
$_SERVER['HTTP_X_APPENGINE_USER_IP'] is the only way your app can retrieve
the client's IP address. The $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] variable isn't
available in App Engine.
Directives with new initialization defaults
The following table specifies directives whose initialization defaults differ from those
supplied with the standard PHP interpreter available from php.net .
To find the default values for directives not specified in the following table, refer to
php.ini directives .
Directive
Default Value in App Engine
expose_php
Off
memory_limit
-1
max_execution_time
0
error_reporting
E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT
display_errors
Off
display_startup_errors
Off
log_errors
On
log_errors_max_len
0
ignore_repeated_errors
Off
ignore_repeated_source
Off
html_errors
Off
opcache.enable
On
opcache.validate_timestamps
Off
opcache.memory_consumption
32
Override these default directives by including them in a php.ini
file for your app.
tempnam() and sys_get_temp_dir() support
App Engine apps run in a security sandbox in which only the /tmp
directory is writable and stored in the instance's RAM. For this reason,
App Engine's version of
tempnam()
returns an in-memory temp file that can be written to a permanent storage
solution such as
Cloud Storage buckets .
Here is an example on how to write to the in-memory temp file using
file_put_contents() and fwrite() .
< ?php
$dir = sys_get_temp_dir();
$tmp = tempnam($dir, "foo");
file_put_contents($tmp, "hello");
$f = fopen($tmp, "a");
fwrite($f, " world");
fclose($f);
echo file_get_contents($tmp);
The expected output from the example would then be:
hello world
Note: When an instance is deleted, any temporary files created by tempnam()
are also removed.
