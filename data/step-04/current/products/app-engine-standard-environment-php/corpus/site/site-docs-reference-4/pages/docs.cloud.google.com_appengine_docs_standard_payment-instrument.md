Payment method required for all App Engine runtimes
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
As of November 30, 2019, you can only deploy new versions of your
App Engine apps if your account provides a
payment method ,
such as a credit card. As of August 9, 2021, all App Engine apps require
a payment method to continue running. This requirement applies to apps
in all App Engine runtimes, including Java 8, Python 2.7, PHP 5, and Go 1.11 apps
in the App Engine standard environment.
As of August 9, 2021, if a running application does not have a payment method,
it will be shut down.
While you must provide a payment method for your accounts,
the App Engine free tier has not changed and is not going away .
Why we made this change
Requiring a payment method for all runtimes prevents fraud and abuse, and
brings App Engine in line with the rest of Google Cloud. This allows
us to spend more time on delivering new features and supporting you as you grow
on App Engine.
In addition, all App Engine runtimes now use Cloud Build to build
apps into a container during the deployment process. Cloud Build
requires a payment method, and therefore if a payment method is not
present, deployments to App Engine will fail . As of August 9, 2021,
if a running application does not have a payment method, it will be shut down .
You can reinstate your application by adding a payment method.
Other than providing a payment method, you don't need to make any other
changes to your project. The change to Cloud Build is entirely in the
background and has no effect on deployment commands or administration APIs.
What remains the same
The free tier on App Engine is unchanged.
What you will see
If you do not have a valid payment method on the project, you will see:
HTTP 500 errors returned when requests are sent to your app
App log entries in your App Engine logs that read
"Billing disabled. Shutting down instance."
What you need to do
You will need to add a payment method to your project if you have
App Engine apps using the Java 8, Python 2.7, PHP 5, and Go 1.11 runtimes
in the App Engine standard environment.
To add a payment method to your project:
Create a billing account
if you do not already have one.
Add your credit card or other payment method as a payment method.
Link your project to the billing account.

Why we are making this change
This change is driven by the following goals:
Reducing fraud on App Engine
Increasing the integration of App Engine with other Google Cloud
services
Reduce fraud on App Engine
Fraud hurts all legitimate users of App Engine and Google. Our
engineering and support teams invest significant amounts of time in preventing,
monitoring, and diagnosing fraudulent usage. This limits the resources we have
available to legitimate customers. In addition, fraud costs Google money, which
raises costs for everyone as it must be accounted for in our pricing of
App Engine.
We have direct evidence from our experience with the newer runtimes that
requiring a payment method reduces fraud.
Integrate App Engine with other Google Cloud services
App Engine launched in 2008, predating Google Cloud, and was built in a
completely custom and proprietary architecture, since there was no broader platform
to integrate with. Now that Google Cloud is a large and sophisticated
platform, our customers are asking for App Engine to integrate
seamlessly with the services available in Google Cloud.
Integration with other Google Cloud services is possible through
Serverless VPC Access, which allows App Engine to sit within
the same VPC as Compute Engine VMs and Google Kubernetes Engine clusters. As part of the
integration, we are moving App Engine builds to Cloud Build, which
has the following benefits:
Detailed build output including verbose warnings and errors
The ability to view build history in the Cloud Build section of
the Cloud console
(Coming soon) The ability to include any library in your code in addition to
the predefined set that is available in the App Engine runtimes
Almost all Google Cloud services require a payment method, so this
additional integration means that App Engine must also require a payment
method.
Costs of using Cloud Build
Cloud Build has a free tier that includes 120 build minutes per
billing account, per day. For example, if your build took 5 minutes to complete,
you would be able to deploy 24 times a day without incurring any charges.
For more information on pricing beyond the free tier, see
Cloud Build pricing .
Limit your costs
You can use the following mechanisms to limit your App Engine costs:
Set the max_instances
setting in your app.yaml configuration file to 1 to restrict your instance
usage to the free tier.
Set a budget and alerts to monitor your
resource consumption across all Google Cloud services.
Manually disable your app
once it goes above a preset usage level.
