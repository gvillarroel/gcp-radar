Service Directory overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Service Directory is a service covered by Google's obligations set forth
in the Cloud Data Processing Addendum .
Service Directory is a single place to publish, discover, and connect to
services in a consistent and reliable way, regardless of their environment.
Service Directory supports services in Google Cloud, multi-cloud,
and on-premises environments and can scale up to thousands of services and
endpoints for a single project.
Service Directory has the following features:
A Registration and Lookup API for creating and resolving
namespaces ,
services , and
endpoints
Integration with Cloud DNS . Service Directory zones
allow services to be made available on Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
IAM integration to assign and control service
visibility and permissions
Built-in Google Cloud CLI
and
Google Cloud console
support for interacting with Service Directory
Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging integration for monitoring,
auditing, and debugging Service Directory operations
Why Service Directory
As applications adopt services, being able to resolve the location of a service
becomes more difficult as the endpoints of those services change. Services
deployed across hybrid environments present additional obstacles as neither may
share the same naming system, making resolving and connecting services
challenging. To illustrate the problem, consider the following.
Imagine that you are building a simple API and that your code needs to call some
other application. When endpoint information remains static, you can hard-code
these locations into your code or store them in a small configuration file.
However, with microservices and multi-cloud, this problem becomes much harder to
solve as instances, services, and environments can all change.

With Service Directory, you can register all of your services in a single
place and resolve them by using HTTP, gRPC, and DNS.
Let us revisit the previous diagram, but this time adding Service Directory.
In the following diagram, each service instance is registered with Service Directory.
These registrations are immediately reflected in DNS and can be queried by using
HTTP/gRPC regardless of their implementation and environment.

You can create a universal service name that works across Google Cloud
products, like App Engine and GKE. You can make these services
available over DNS. You can apply access controls
to services based on network, project, and IAM roles of
service accounts.
Service Directory solves the following problems:
Interoperability : Service Directory is a universal naming service
that works across Google Cloud, multi-cloud, and on-premises.
You can migrate services between these environments and still use the same
service name to register and resolve endpoints.
Service management : Service Directory is a managed service.
Your organization does not have to worry about the high availability,
redundancy, scaling, or maintenance concerns of maintaining your own
service registry.
Access Control : With Service Directory, you can control who can
register and resolve your services using IAM. Assign
Service Directory roles to teams, service accounts, and organizations.
Limitations of pure DNS : DNS resolvers can be unreliable in terms of
respecting TTLs and caching, cannot handle larger record sizes, and do not
offer an easy way to serve metadata to users. In addition to DNS support,
Service Directory offers HTTP and gRPC APIs to query and resolve
services.
Use Cloud DNS with Service Directory
Cloud DNS is a fast, scalable, and reliable
Domain Name System
(DNS) service running on Google's infrastructure.
In addition to public DNS zones,
Cloud DNS
also provides a managed internal DNS solution for private networks on
Google Cloud.
Private DNS zones
enable you to internally name your virtual machine (VM) instances, load
balancers, or other resources. DNS queries for those private DNS zones are
restricted to your private networks.
The following diagram illustrates how you can use Service Directory zones
to make service names available using DNS lookups.
Using Cloud DNS with Service Directory (click to enlarge)
Overview of the individual components:
The endpoints are registered directly with Service Directory by
using the Service Directory API. You can register both
Google Cloud and non-Google Cloud services with Service Directory.
Both external and internal clients can look up those services
at: https://servicedirectory.googleapis.com
To enable DNS requests, create a Service Directory zone in
Cloud DNS
that is associated with a Service Directory namespace.
Internal clients can resolve this service by using DNS, HTTP, and gRPC.
External clients (clients not on the private network) must use
HTTP or gRPC to resolve service names.
Example configuration
How to expose a service over DNS
The following diagram illustrates how a microservice architecture is modeled in
Service Directory and made available using DNS. Notice that Service Directory
maintains the services and endpoints entirely,
but the private zone is in Cloud DNS.
Exposing a service over DNS (click to enlarge)
In this diagram (left side), the payments service is registered to a
namespace with the name backend-namespace , the region us-east1 , and the
project gcp-project . The namespace is linked to the private zone
example.com .
To do a DNS lookup, the client requests the
SRV record
for the domain name _payments._tcp.payments.example.com , which
resolves to the port numbers and address records for the payment service's
endpoints.
