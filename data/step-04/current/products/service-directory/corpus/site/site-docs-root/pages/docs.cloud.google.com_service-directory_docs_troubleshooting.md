Why do I get a not found error when adding an endpoint?
If you are getting 404 errors when adding services or endpoints,
ensure that you have created both the namespace and the service (in that order)
before adding an endpoint. The service must exist before you can add additional
endpoints.
When I look up a service, why don't I get any of my endpoints?
Ensure that the project, region, namespace name, and service name are all correct
in your request and match where you registered the endpoints. All
Service Directory services live in a regional namespace, so services
registered with one region do not match data in a separate region.
I granted someone access to a service but they continue to get permission denied .
This could be for a couple of reasons. First, check that the region is correct.
If you set a policy on a namespace or service, the policy only applies to that
particular region. If the user is trying to register or lookup the same service
in another region, they won't have access unless you grant them
IAM access to that regional service as well. To debug access
issues, try the
TestIamPermissions
method for services and namespaces.
I added some endpoints and then removed the service backend. Why are the endpoints still there?
Service Directory does not do automatic health-checking or heartbeating, and
does not remove endpoints unless you explicitly remove them. Ensure that you
add code to your service backends/orchestrators that remove the endpoint from
Service Directory once it no longer exists. We recommend the use of time-to-live
annotation fields on endpoints to record the last time an endpoint was registered
or updated.
I am able to look up endpoints but every time I try to connect to them, it fails.
Service Directory does not ensure the reachability from the client. Services
register their endpoints directly with Service Directory. However, the address
registered with Service Directory may not be routable (especially if both the
client and the server are on separate private networks). If the endpoint is
routable from the client, then it could be due to an unhealthy endpoint.
See the following question.
How can I add health data for endpoints so that my clients know which one to connect to?
When using client-side load balancing, we recommend that service backends
occasionally update an annotation field on the endpoint that clients can use to
make decisions on which backend to connect to. Service Directory does not
inspect or evaluate this data.
I've created a namespace. Why can't I assign a Cloud DNS private zone to it?
Ensure that you have the servicedirectory.namespaces.associatePrivateZone
IAM permission for the namespace as this permission lets you
create the associated private zone. By default, the Project Editor, Project
Owner, Service Directory Admin, and Service Directory Editor roles have this
permission.
When I do a DNS lookup of a service, why don't I get any of my endpoints?
There could be several reasons, such as the following:
The associated namespace has been deleted. You can check this by running the
get command on the private zone.
If the serviceDirectoryConfig.deletionTime is set, then the associated
namespace and all of its endpoints have been deleted.
Confirm that you are issuing the request from a network that is allowed to
query the private zone. You can find the network list by running the
get command on the private zone.
There are no (valid) endpoints for the service. Run the
resolve
command on the service through the Service Directory API to ensure that the
service is not empty and has at least one valid endpoint IP. DNS support is
only available for endpoints with valid IPv4 or IPv6 IP addresses.
Make sure that you're querying the correct zone. For example,
suppose that you create a Service Directory zone called example.com ,
and you have another (standard) private zone named billing.example.com .
Then any DNS query to billing.example.com returns resource records
that belong to the billing.example.com zone, and not the billing
service in the Service Directory namespace that is associated with
example.com.
For more information, see Name resolution
order .
Why are my GKE services not syncing to Service Directory?
There could be several reasons, such as the following:
Confirm that you have a ServiceDirectoryRegistrationPolicy deployed in
your GKE cluster for the namespace that you are trying
to sync. Also, confirm that the services you are trying to sync
match the label selector in your policy.
There is already an existing Service Directory namespace that was created
manually or by using some other integration with the same name as the
GKE namespace you are trying to sync. You must rename
or delete your existing Service Directory namespace so that there are no
conflicts.
Permissions from your Service Directory Service Account were removed.
Make sure that service-{PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-servicedirectory.iam.gserviceaccount.com
has the Service Directory Service Agent IAM permission. For
details about IAM, see the IAM
documentation .
