This product or feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section
of the Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
This page provides information about how to configure Service Directory with
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and automatically register your
GKE clusters with Service Directory. You can configure
Service Directory for GKE with Autopilot
GKE clusters or Standard GKE clusters.
For information about the two modes, see
Choose a GKE mode of operation .
To learn more about Service Directory for GKE, see
Service Directory for GKE overview .
Limitations
Service Directory for GKE has the following
limitations:
You can only register services using the
Service Directory-GKE integration. You must register
ingresses, gateways, and other resources manually using the Service Directory
API.
You must register your GKE clusters by using
Fleets before you
can sync services in those clusters to Service Directory. For details on
how to register your GKE clusters, see Registering a
cluster .
All Service Directory resources are registered in the fleet project, not
the project of the cluster.
You can not modify the Service Directory entities registered using this
integration. You must make all changes to the GKE service
resources themselves so that they propagate to Service Directory.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

You must register your GKE cluster to a fleet.
To register your GKE cluster, follow the instructions in
Registering a
cluster .
Set up the GKE cluster
To set up the GKE cluster, follow these steps.
Enable the Service Directory GKE fleet feature.
Configure the Service Directory registration policy.
Deploy the GKE service.
Enable the Service Directory GKE fleet feature
To enable the Service Directory GKE fleet
feature, run
the gcloud container hub command.
gcloud
gcloud alpha container hub service-directory enable
Configure the Service Directory registration policy for the service
The registration policy defines what kinds of services within GKE
are automatically imported by Service Directory. The following list shows the
configurable options for this policy:
resources : the type of GKE resources that
are imported. You can specify multiple resource types. Resources are
identified by Group and Kind . By default, the Group is core . Only Kind:
service is available.
selector : a GKE label selector which matches on
key:value labels that are applied on the GKE
resource. By default, no resources are selected.
annotationsToSync : the annotation keys on the resource that
are synced to Service Directory. If this list is empty, then resources are
synced to Service Directory without annotations.
Each namespace should define a single policy. This policy must have name:
"default" . The Controller does not allow or reconcile other names.
Configure a ServiceDirectoryRegistrationPolicy .
The following manifest describes a ServiceDirectoryRegistrationPolicy :
apiVersion : networking . gke . io / v1alpha1
kind : ServiceDirectoryRegistrationPolicy
metadata :
# Only the name "default" is allowed .
name : default
# The ServiceDirectoryRegistrationPolicy is a namespaced resource
namespace : NAMESPACE
spec :
resources :
# Kind specifies the types of Kubernetes resources that can be synced into Service Directory .
- kind : Service
# Selector is a label selector for the resource types specified in Kind .
selector :
matchLabels :
LABELS
# annotationsToSync specifies the annotations that are matched and imported .
# Any annotations that do not match this set of keys will not be imported into Service Directory .
annotationsToSync :
- ANNOTATIONS
Replace the following:
NAMESPACE : the name of the namespace. There can only be
one ServiceDirectoryRegistrationPolicy in a namespace. If there are
multiple policies in a single namespace, GKE chooses
one policy to be the active policy and marks the others as inactive.
LABELS : the label selector, such as, sd-import: "true" .
This value applies to resources specified in kind. By default, no
resources are selected.
ANNOTATIONS : a list of annotations that are matched and
imported, such as, - cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type If a
selected GKE resource has one of the annotations in
the list, the annotation and its values are synced to Service Directory
with the resource. If this list is empty, then resources are synced to
Service Directory without annotations.
Save the manifest as registration_policy.yaml .
Apply the manifest to your cluster
To apply the manifest to your cluster, run the kubectl apply -f command:
kubectl apply -f registration_policy.yaml
Deploy the GKE service
Deploy the GKE external passthrough Network Load Balancer service and
application in your region's GKE cluster, for example, if
your region is us-central1 , deploy it in a GKE cluster
gke-us-central1 .
This imports your GKE service into Service Directory.
Create a YAML file and apply it like any other GKE
resource. Here is a manifest for a service of type LoadBalancer :
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: hello-app-service
labels:
sd-import: "true"
annotations:
cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: "Internal"
spec:
type: LoadBalancer
selector:
app: hello
ports:
- name: tcp-port
protocol: TCP
port: 80
targetPort: 8080
Here is a manifest for a Deployment :
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
labels:
app: hello
name: hello-app
spec:
replicas: 2
selector:
matchLabels:
app: hello
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: hello
spec:
containers:
- image: gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
name: hello
ports:
- containerPort: 8080
protocol: TCP
To verify, run the Service Directory query for your service by using the
gcloud service-directory services resolve
command:
gcloud
gcloud beta service-directory services resolve SERVICE_NAME \
--location= LOCATION \
--namespace= NAMESPACE
Replace the following:
SERVICE_NAME : the name or fully qualified identifier
for the service, for example hello-app-service
LOCATION : the name of the region for the service, for
example, us-central1
NAMESPACE : the name of the namespace for the service,
for example, default
Your output shows your service and is similar to the following:
service:
endpoints:
- address: 10.140.0.5
metadata:
cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: "Internal"
name: projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/namespaces/default/services/hello-app-service/endpoints/my-cluster-12345
port: 80
network: projects/123456789/locations/global/networks/default
name: projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/namespaces/default/services/hello-app-service
Billing
Service Directory does not charge for resources created by the
GKE integration. However, there is a charge for the API
calls. For pricing details, see Service Directory
pricing .
