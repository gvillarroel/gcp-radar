Guest environment

Linux
Windows
This document provides an overview of the guest environment, which contains
scripts, daemons, and binaries that instances need to run on
Compute Engine.
The guest environment communicates with the metadata server, which is a
per-instance HTTP server that runs alongside every Compute Engine
instance. The metadata server provides the instance with essential configuration
and operational data. For more information about the types of metadata that's
stored on the metadata server, see VM metadata .
The guest environment is automatically installed on Compute Engine instances
that are created by using most of the Google-provided public operating system
(OS) images. Each OS image requires specific guest environment packages.
These packages are built either by Google or the operating system distributor.
For a full list of OS images that include the guest environment,
see Operating system details .
Guest environment components
The following section describes the packages and services that enable an
instance to communicate with Compute Engine.
The guest agent
The central component of the guest environment is the guest agent, which handles
tasks like account management, OS Login integration, and network interface
management. The guest agent is available for both Linux and Windows operating
systems, with the following package names:
Linux: google-guest-agent
Windows: google-compute-engine-windows
For detailed information about the guest agent,
including its features, architecture, and how to manage the agent, see
Guest agent .
Linux components
The base components of a Linux guest environment are deb or rpm
packages. Compute Engine creates these packages with the appropriate configurations for the
supported distribution. To see the list of installed packages on your Linux
instance, connect to the instance, and run the command provided for your OS
version in the
Installed packages by operating system version
table.
The Linux guest environment includes the following key packages.
Package name
Description
Key interactions
Link to source code on GitHub
google-guest-agent
This package is the guest agent for the Linux environment.
The Linux
guest agent contains the scripts that run on the guest OS to
support Compute Engine features. For detailed information about the guest agent,
including its features, architecture, and how to manage the agent, see
Guest agent .
Reads data from and writes data to the
VM metadata
Sends logs to the serial port and optionally
Cloud Logging
guest-agent
google-compute-engine
Contains the scripts and files required for system initialization and
configuration.
This package contains the following:
System init scripts for systemd
System configurations, such as udev rules,
sysctl rules, rsyslog configs, and
dhcp configs, that are used for hostname setting
Bash scripts that run during instance boot
A gce-resolved.conf file, introduced in October 2024, that ensures that
domain lookups for .local Cloud DNS domains route to
the metadata server. Without this file, domain lookups route
through systemd-resolved , which frequently fails.
If your environment doesn't use
.local domains, you can remove the
gce-resolved.conf file if it conflicts with your existing
configurations.
Works with the following packages to configure instances.
google-guest-agent
google-compute-engine-oslogin
guest-configs
google-compute-engine-oslogin
Contains the necessary binaries, modules, and scripts to manage
instance access using OS Login. OS Login lets you manage access to
instances by using IAM roles. For more information about
OS Login, see OS Login .
This package contains the following:
Authorized Keys Command :
a command that uses the public SSH keys to authenticate users at login.
Name Service Switch (NSS) Modules :
a service that provides the OS Login user and group information to the system.
Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) :
a module that provides authorization (and authentication if two-factor support is
enabled) support. This module lets the system use Google Cloud
IAM permissions to control whether the system can log into
an instance or perform operations as root (with sudo ).
google_oslogin_nss_cache : a utility for updating the local user and group cache.
selinux :
a package that contains SELinux policy definition files and a compiled policy package for
configuring SELinux to support OS Login.
Reads data from and writes data to the VM
metadata
Send logs to the serial port and optionally
Cloud Logging
guest-oslogin
gce-disk-expand
Contains the components required for resizing a boot disk.
Sends logs to the serial port
gce-disk-expand
google-osconfig-agent
Contains the OS Config agent, which VM Manager uses to manage OS
inventory, patches, and policies. For more information about the OS Config agent,
see VM Manager .
Reads data from and writes data to the VM metadata
By default, the OS Config agent doesn't collect or send any information
until you enable the OS Config
agent . After you enable the agent, the agent communicates
with the OS Config API service. To review the operations completed by the
agent, see VM Manager
audit logging .
guest-osconfig
Windows components
All Google-provided Windows OS images are preconfigured with the
GooGet tool and Google Cloud repositories. GooGet installs
and maintains the guest environment for Windows instances. If you need
to install GooGet and set up repositories, see
Packaging
and package distribution in the compute-image-windows GitHub repository. To see
the list of installed packages on your Windows instance, connect to the instance and run
googet installed .
The Windows guest environment includes the following key packages:
