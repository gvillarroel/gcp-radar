Pub/Sub notifications
Stay organized with collections

This page provides an overview of using Pub/Sub to receive
notifications when clinical events occur in a Cloud Healthcare API data
store.
To learn how to set up and use Pub/Sub messages, see
Configuring Pub/Sub notifications .
Overview
You can receive notifications using
Pub/Sub when any of the following clinical events occur:
You store a DICOM instance in a DICOM store using the dicomStores.dicomWeb.studies.storeInstances
method.
You import a DICOM instance into a DICOM store using the dicomStores.import method.
A FHIR resource is created, patched, updated, or deleted in a FHIR store. However,
notifications are not sent when a FHIR resource is imported from Cloud Storage .
An HL7v2 message is ingested or created in an HL7v2 store.
Information about each event is added to the corresponding data store's
Pub/Sub topic in the form of a message.
You can publish messages to any Pub/Sub topic in any project
for which you have sufficient permissions. After the Pub/Sub
topic receives the message, the message will be forwarded to any number of
subscribers to the topic.
DICOM notifications
For information on using Pub/Sub notifications with DICOM data, see
DICOM Pub/Sub notifications .
FHIR notifications
For information on using Pub/Sub notifications with FHIR data,
see FHIR Pub/Sub notifications .
HL7v2 notifications
The following diagram shows the flow of notifications that occur when an HL7v2
message is ingested or created:
The Cloud Healthcare API ingests an HL7v2 message from a care system.
The message is stored in an HL7v2 store.
The HL7v2 store creates and sends a Pub/Sub message to the
store's Pub/Sub topics that have a filter that matches the HL7v2 message.
Pub/Sub forwards the Pub/Sub message to the
topics' subscriptions.
The subscribers receive a notification, in the form of a
Pub/Sub message, from their subscription. Each subscription
can have one or more subscribers for increased parallelism.
Notification format
Notifications sent to a Pub/Sub topic consist of two parts:
Attributes : A set of key:value pairs describing the event. These values
can be used to filter which events a client receives by filtering messages
from a subscription .
Data : A string that contains an identifier for the relevant FHIR resource,
DICOM instance, or HL7v2 message.
DICOM instance data
When a DICOM instance is stored in a DICOM store, the following identifier
is always included in the data field of the Pub/Sub
message:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /dicomStores/ DICOM_STORE_ID /dicomWeb/studies/ STUDY_UID /series/ SERIES_UID /instances/ INSTANCE_UID
Notifications for a stored DICOM instance do not contain
any attribute values.
HL7v2 message data and attributes
When an HL7v2 message is created or ingested into an HL7v2 store, the following
identifier is always included in the data field of the Pub/Sub
message:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us-central1/datasets/ DATASET_ID /hl7V2Stores/ HL7V2_STORE_ID /messages/ HL7V2_MESSAGE_ID
The following set of key:value pairs is always included in the Pub/Sub
message's attributes field:
Attribute name
Possible values
Example
Description
msgType
Any HL7v2 message type .
ADT
