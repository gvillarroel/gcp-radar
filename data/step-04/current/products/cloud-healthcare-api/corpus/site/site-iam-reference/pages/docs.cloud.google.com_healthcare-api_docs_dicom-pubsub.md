Configure DICOM Pub/Sub notifications
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to use Pub/Sub
to get notifications about clinical events in a DICOM store.
You can receive Pub/Sub notifications when a new DICOM instance is
stored, imported from Cloud Storage, updated, or deleted in a DICOM store.
You can use Pub/Sub notifications for multiple purposes, such as
triggering downstream processing or analyzing new data. For example, a
machine learning model can receive
notifications when new data is available for training and generate
insights to improve patient care.
The following figure shows how Pub/Sub notifications are generated
and published.
Figure 1. Receiving Pub/Sub notifications about clinical events in a DICOM store.
Figure 1 shows the following steps:
A caller makes a request to store or import a DICOM instance.
The DICOM store receives the request, creates a Pub/Sub
message, and sends it to the Pub/Sub topic configured on the DICOM store.
Pub/Sub forwards the message to the subscriptions attached
to the topic.
The subscribers receive the message from their subscription. Each subscription
can have one or more subscribers for increased parallelism.
Before you begin
Create a topic .
Create a pull subscription .
Add Pub/Sub publisher permissions
To publish messages from the Cloud Healthcare API to Pub/Sub, you
must add the pubsub.publisher role to
your project's Cloud Healthcare Service Agent service account .
For more information, see DICOM, FHIR, and HL7v2 store Pub/Sub permissions .
Notification configuration
You can configure Pub/Sub notifications and their behavior in a
DicomNotificationConfig
object on a DICOM store. Each DICOM store can have multiple DicomNotificationConfig
objects configured.
The following table describes the fields in the DicomNotificationConfig
object:
Caution: DICOM resource information might contain protected health information
(PHI). Use caution when sending PHI in a Pub/Sub message.
Field
Description
Example
pubsubTopic
The Pub/Sub topic to attach to the DICOM store. Notifications are sent to the specified topic.
projects/my-project/topics/my-topic
Notification format and content
A Pub/Sub notification contains a Message
object that includes information about the clinical event. The Message object
looks similar to the following:
{
"message": {
"attributes": {
"action": " ACTION ",
"lastUpdatedTime": " RFC_1123_FORMAT_DATETIME ",
"storeName": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /dicomStores/ DICOM_STORE_ID ",

Migrate from notificationConfig to notificationConfigs
For existing DICOM store users, if you are using the notificationConfig field
to configure your Pub/Sub topic, you should migrate to the
notificationConfigs field. Here are the key differences:
dicomStore.notificationConfig supports only one subscriber, while
dicomStore.notificationConfigs supports multiple subscribers.
dicomStore.notificationConfig uses NotificationConfig ,
which is being deprecated and replaced by DicomNotificationConfig .
dicomStore.notificationConfigs supports sending notifications for all
available DICOM operations automatically, such as ImportDicomData ,
DeleteInstances , and others. Consequently, NotificationConfig.sendForBulkImport
is no longer supported.
If you want to choose which messages to receive or filter out unwanted
messages for a specific subscriber, you can use the Filter messages from a subscription
feature. For example, you can use attributes.action != "ImportDicomData" to
filter out all messages sent from the ImportDicomData operation.
REST
Use the
dicomStores.patch
method, assume you already have a topic set in your store using
notificationConfig .
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project
LOCATION : the dataset location
DATASET_ID : the DICOM store's parent dataset
DICOM_STORE_ID : the DICOM store ID
Request JSON body:
{
"notificationConfigs": [

Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running

"notificationConfigs": [
{
"pubsubTopic": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /topics/ PUBSUB_TOPIC_SAMPLE_1 "
},
{
"pubsubTopic": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /topics/ PUBSUB_TOPIC_SAMPLE_2 "
}
]
}
Cloud Healthcare API and Pub/Sub message storage policy
To ensure that your Cloud Healthcare API data and the associated data in Pub/Sub
messages reside in the same region, you must set a Pub/Sub
message storage policy .
You must explicitly set the message storage policy on the Pub/Sub
topic configured on the data store to ensure that the data stays in the same
region. For example, if your Cloud Healthcare API dataset and FHIR store are in
us-central1 , the message storage policy must only allow the us-central1 region.
To configure a message storage policy, see Configuring message store policies .
Troubleshoot missed Pub/Sub messages
If a notification can't be published to Pub/Sub, an error is
logged to Cloud Logging . For more information, see
Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging .
If the rate of error generation exceeds a limit, errors in excess of the limit
aren't submitted to Cloud Logging.
