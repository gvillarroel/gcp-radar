Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)
is a healthcare data standard with an application programming interface (API)
for representing and exchanging electronic health records (EHR). FHIR is an
information network that lets you link data across systems and a communication
network that lets you exchange data between systems.
FHIR includes the following:
An HTTP-based RESTful protocol
Data representation that uses JSON, XML, and RDF
For more details about FHIR, see the most recently published version of the FHIR
specification .
Importance of FHIR in healthcare information technology
Healthcare IT systems often don't share the same data models. As healthcare
data becomes more digitized, solving incompatibilities between different systems
becomes expensive and time-consuming.
FHIR defines a common data model and REST architecture so that different healthcare
systems can share and integrate data. FHIR is designed to be flexible and
adaptable, so that it can be used in a wide range of settings and with
different health care information systems.
FHIR uses resources to represent discrete medical, administrative, infrastructural, or
financial data elements. Each resource is linked to a unique identifier, making
it simpler for applications to access and modify the same data.
Resources can be compiled and distributed to different
healthcare providers in formats that comply with their respective data models.
FHIR is a valuable tool for improving the interoperability of healthcare IT
systems. It can help to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and improve the
quality of care.
Benefits of FHIR
Interoperability across devices and platforms
FHIR accommodates the exchange of healthcare data from monolithic data silos to
open APIs. FHIR is the primary healthcare data standard with open APIs for
accessing, searching, and modifying electronic health records (EHR) and
exchanging data between healthcare IT systems.
FHIR lets EHR to be exchanged between healthcare providers and consumers on
platforms such as the following:
EHR-based data sharing
Mobile apps
Cloud-based applications
Wearable devices
The FHIR API also lets third-party apps integrate with existing systems.
Compatibility with legacy standards
FHIR evolved from HL7 Version 2 messaging and HL7 Version 3 Clinical Document
Architecture (HL7 CDA). FHIR can be used in partnership with HL7v2 and HL7 CDA.
For more information on the relationship between FHIR and other HL7 standards,
see Appendix: The Relationship between FHIR and other HL7 Standards .
Decipherable and useful data
Because FHIR is implemented on top of the HTTPS protocol, you can retrieve and
dissect FHIR resources to support machine learning, AI, and other forms of data
analytics. These capabilities let you generate a deeper and more versatile
understanding of your healthcare data.
Efficient data exchange
FHIR's resource-based approach facilitates more efficient and accurate data
exchange. Because FHIR uses a uniform standard for health information, it lets
you build custom templates from the shared base resources, and it eliminates
inconsistency in data templates. This uniformity improves the accuracy and
readability of data in data exchanges across health systems.
FHIR eliminates the need to individually modify the data template of every
health IT system by exchanging data as resources. FHIR exposes resources such as
patients, admissions, and medications as services . Therefore, consumer mobile
apps can use GET and POST requests to retrieve and manipulate only the
relevant data.
FHIR architecture
FHIR stores
A FHIR store is a data store in the Cloud Healthcare API that holds FHIR
resources. FHIR stores exist inside datasets.
The FhirStore
resource provides a representation of a FHIR store's attributes. For each FHIR
store, you can choose options such as:
Enabling the updateCreate capability
( DSTU2 ,
STU3 ,
R4 ,
R5 ).
Publishing changes to the FHIR store to a Pub/Sub topic.
Requiring referential integrity .
Enabling resource versioning
( DSTU2 ,
STU3 ,
R4 ,
R5 ).
The state of these configuration options is shown in the FHIR store's
capability statement
( STU3
or R4
or R5 )
or conformance statement (DSTU2) .
FHIR resources
FHIR uses resources to organize data formats and elements. Each resource
has the following properties:
A shared method for defining and representing data, built upon data types
consisting of reusable clusters of elements.
A common set of metadata, providing technical and structural context.
A human-readable text representation that uses HTML as a fallback display
option for clinical safety.
FHIR specifies a base set of resources that can be combined in various ways to
meet the data model demands of healthcare providers. It also provides
representations of clinical observations and documents. FHIR does not aim to
encompass every possible document or data type. Instead, FHIR first
supports most clinical and billing use cases. You can then extend
your FHIR implementation to meet additional clinical or organizational needs.
FHIR profiles
Using extensions, applications can customize the existing resources and describe
their specifications with profiles. Profiles are a set of instructions in
addition to the existing core specification for resources that fall under a
specific use and context. The Cloud Healthcare API enforces profiles by validating
resources against the constraints in the relevant profile.
For instance, recording a patient's ethnicity is not allowed in certain regions,
but required in others. Using profiles, the FHIR base specification can define
and require an "ethnicity" extension in accordance with the regional policies.
Therefore, profiles help countries, regions, districts, and organizations
customize data in accordance with their healthcare data regulations and needs.
You can use profiles to do the following:
Extend and restrict the FHIR API by defining additional operations, specify
required pre-existing search parameters, and add new search parameters.
Extend and restrict resources by defining extensions of resources and changing
the cardinality of fields.
A collection of profiles can be published as an implementation guide.
Implementation guides are both machine- and human-readable. They can be
exchanged and searched using REST and used to generate code and user interfaces.
For more information on FHIR extensions, see
FHIR extensions .
FHIR base URL implementation
As shown in the official FHIR documentation
( DSTU2 ,
STU3 ,
and R4 ),
a FHIR Service Base URL uses the format
http(s)://server/ PATH . For example,
https://server/path/Observation .
The Cloud Healthcare API uses a base URL that aligns with this standard.
The Cloud Healthcare API base URL contains the following parts:
The endpoint for the Cloud Healthcare API
The version of the Cloud Healthcare API
The project ID
The name of a dataset
The dataset's location
The name of a FHIR store
The /fhir suffix
The following table shows the format of a FHIR Service Base URL and its
equivalent base URL in the Cloud Healthcare API:
FHIR Service Base URL Cloud Healthcare API equivalent URL
http(s)://server/ PATH
https://healthcare.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /fhirStores/ FHIR_STORE_ID /fhir
To get information about a patient using the FHIR RESTful
API, make an HTTP GET request. The following table shows the format to use to
get this information using the FHIR Service Base URL and its equivalent base URL
in the Cloud Healthcare API:
FHIR Service Base URL Cloud Healthcare API equivalent URL
http(s)://server/path/Patient/ PATIENT_ID
https://healthcare.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /fhirStores/ FHIR_STORE_ID /fhir/Patient/ PATIENT_ID
FHIR conformance
For more information on the FHIR DSTU2, STU3, and R4 implementations in the
Cloud Healthcare API, see the
FHIR conformance statement .
Integrating with OMOP
OMOP Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) is a standard developed by Observational
Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI). It is primarily used for
observational clinical data. The OHDSI tool suite can assist common analytics
use cases such as cohort definition, cohort generation, and population effect
estimation. It is a commonly used data model in genomics and pharmaceutical
research due to its expansive terminology and genetics support.
See the following resources for more details about OMOP:
OMOP common data model
OMOP common data model and standardized vocabularies
Getting started with OHDSI
By integrating FHIR and OMOP, clinical data from EHRs and other sources in the
FHIR format can be used as research data in the OMOP standard. Specific fields
and data elements in OMOP can also be integrated into existing data in FHIR.
You can use the open-sourced Cloud Healthcare API Data Harmonization mapping engine to perform the following tasks:
Harmonizing data to the OMOP CDM and others.
Configuring data mapping for FHIR-to-OMOP data conversion.
