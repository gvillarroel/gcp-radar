Consent Management API data model
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how information is organized within the Consent Management API
and explains how various resource fields can be used.
Overview
The Consent Management API manages data related to consent and
privacy across the following areas:
Configuration information . Consent store settings and data related to the
configuration of your consent store, including expiration time and
policy building blocks, such as consent attribute definitions.
Consent records . Data related to the permissions granted by your
users, including consents and any linked consent artifacts.
Managed resources . User data mappings and data related to the resources being
managed by the Consent Management API. User data mappings are stored within the
Consent Management API while the managed resources are stored outside the
Consent Management API.
Data model
The Consent Management API uses the following data model:
Configuration information
Consent data is stored in a consent store. You can create one or more consent
stores that are configured and operated independently. Your consent store
configuration choices determine what other Consent Management API resources
you can create and how those resources behave.
Depending on your use case, you might require more than one consent store. You
can then organize your consent stores by configuring them with key-value labels.
You can configure a default expiration period that applies to consents
created within the store. For example, you could set the store expiration period
to one year so that new consents created in the store would expire one year
after creation. If a consent is created with its own expiration period, that
expiration period is used instead of the store's default expiration period. For
more information on consent stores and their configuration, see
Creating and updating user consents .
Creating attribute definitions is another way to configure the behavior of your
consent store. Attribute definition resources specify what attributes and
attribute values are permitted in the consent store. The collection of attribute
definitions in your consent store defines the consent and privacy concepts
that your consent store can process.
Each attribute is classified as either a resource attribute or a request
attribute. Resource attributes are attributes that describe the data that your
consent store manages. Resource attributes are used to create user data
mappings, to construct consent policies, and to constrain the scope of access
determination requests to specific types of data.
Request attributes are attributes that describe how the data in your consent
store can be used. Request attributes are necessary to construct the
authorization rules of consent policies and are required to describe the
proposed use during access determination requests. For more information on
attribute definitions, see
Configuring consent policies using attributes .
Consent records
You can create consent resources and consent artifact resources when recording a
user's consent in the Consent Management API. Consent resources record the specific
conditions for which a consent is valid and allow the Consent Management API to
fulfill access determination requests. Consent artifact resources record the
conditions for which the user granted the consent and provide documentation of
the granting of consent.
Consent resources
Consent resources contain one or more policies that describe the granted consent
in terms of the attributes and attribute values configured within the consent store.
Consent resources are specific to a user and a userID is specified for each
consent resource. The userID is an identifier that indicates who the consent
belongs to. The same identifier is used when creating user data mappings.
Consent policies use resource attributes to describe what data a consent applies
to and authorization rules to define which uses of that data are permitted.
Authorization rules are expressed using request attributes and the
Common Expression Language (CEL) .
You can construct policies from any of the attribute values defined in your
consent store's attribute definitions.
For more information on policies, see
Policy enforcement .
Consent resources can have one of the following states:
Active : the consent has been granted by the user and will be evaluated
during most access determination methods. You can change active consents
to revoked if the user needs to revoke the consent.
Revoked : the consent has been revoked by the user and this resource will
be ignored during all access determinations.
Draft : the consent has not yet been granted by the user but can be
evaluated in access determinations, under certain conditions. You can change
draft consents to active if the user grants consent. The draft resource can
be changeed to rejected if the user declines the consent.
Rejected : the consent has not been granted and will be ignored during
all access determinations.
You can also define an expiration for consents as an absolute date or as a time
duration. Consents that do not have an expiration inherit the store's default
expiration duration. If the consent store's default expiration is not configured
and you do not define a consent's expiration, then that consent will not
expire.
Consent artifacts
Consent artifact resources record the documentation to support the policies
described by consent resources. This documentation can include the following:
Timestamps
Signatures of the user, guardian, or witness
Images or screen captures that document the user's consent experience
eConsent documentation such as a signed PDF or other evidence of consent
Additional metadata, such as names, dates, or contact information
Consent resources are linked to consent artifact resources when the consent
resource is created. You can include information that can be used to identify a user
within a consent artifact resource. To limit access to this information, you can
configure permissions just for consent artifacts. For
more information on consent permissions, see
Access control .
Managed resources
The Consent Management API manages access for resources stored in various
locations, either on Google Cloud, on-premises, or with another cloud
provider. Information about the resources being managed is contained within
user data mappings, which allows the Consent Management API to make access
determinations without requiring access to the managed resources themselves.
User data mappings use the dataID field to uniquely identify the resources being
managed. The managed resources can be located anywhere that can be described
using
a string.
The userID field is an identifier that represents the user to which the managed
resource is associated. This is the same identifier that is used when creating
consent and consent artifact resources.
The set of resource attribute values contained within a user data mapping
describes the resource represented by that user data mapping. The permitted
resource attribute values are defined by the consent store's attribute definitions.
For more information on creating and managing user data mappings, see
Registering user data .
