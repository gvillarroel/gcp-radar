Create and manage datasets
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create, edit, view, list, and delete datasets.
After creating a dataset, you can create
data stores that hold electronic health records and medical imaging data,
de-identify the dataset, and more.
Before you begin
See the Cloud Healthcare API
Data model .
Create a dataset
The following samples show how to create a dataset.
Note: If you have specific compliance or regulatory requirements
related to the keys that protect your data, create your dataset using
the instructions in
Enable customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for Cloud Healthcare API datasets .
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles:
Permissions
healthcare.datasets.create
Roles
Healthcare Dataset Administrator
( roles/healthcare.datasetAdmin )
You can ask your administrator to grant you these Identity and Access Management roles. For instructions on
granting roles, see Manage access or
Control access to Cloud Healthcare API resources .
You might also be able to get the required permissions through
custom roles or other
predefined roles .
Note : If you created a Google Cloud project for this guide, then, as the project creator, you're automatically granted the Owner ( roles/owner ) IAM role, which has the permissions. You don't need to be granted any additional IAM roles.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Browser page.
Go to Browser
Click add_box Create dataset . The Dataset properties page is displayed.
In the Name field, enter an identifier for the dataset subject to the
dataset permitted characters and size requirements .
Select one of the following location types:
Region . The dataset permanently resides within one Google Cloud region.
After selecting this option, type or select a location in the Region field.
Multi-region . The dataset permanently resides within a location that spans
multiple Google Cloud regions. After selecting this option, type or select
a multi-region location in the Multi-region field.
Click Create . The Browser page is displayed. The new dataset is displayed in the list of datasets.
gcloud
Run the gcloud healthcare datasets create command.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION : a supported location for the dataset
DATASET_ID :
an identifier subject to the dataset permitted characters and size requirements
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud healthcare datasets create DATASET_ID \
--location = LOCATION
Windows (PowerShell)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud healthcare datasets create DATASET_ID `
--location = LOCATION
Windows (cmd.exe)
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud healthcare datasets create DATASET_ID ^
--location = LOCATION
You should receive a response similar to the following:
Create request issued for: [ DATASET_ID ]
Created dataset [ DATASET_ID ].
REST
Create the dataset using the projects.locations.datasets.create method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project
LOCATION : a supported location for the dataset
DATASET_ID :
an identifier subject to the dataset permitted characters and size requirements
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d "" \ "https://healthcare.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets?datasetId= DATASET_ID "
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:

APIs Explorer
Open the
method reference page .
The APIs Explorer panel opens on the right side of the page.
You can interact with this tool to send requests.
Complete any required fields and click Execute .
The output is the following. The response contains an identifier for a
long-running operation (LRO).
Long-running operations are returned when method calls might take additional time to complete.
Note the value of OPERATION_ID . You need this value in the next step.
Response
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /operations/ OPERATION_ID "

make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project
LOCATION : the dataset location
DATASET_ID : the dataset ID
OPERATION_ID : the ID returned from the long-running operation
To send your request, choose one of these options:

Edit a dataset
The following samples show how to edit a dataset.
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles:
Permissions
healthcare.datasets.update
Roles
Healthcare Dataset Administrator
( roles/healthcare.datasetAdmin )
You can ask your administrator to grant you these Identity and Access Management roles. For instructions on
granting roles, see Manage access or
Control access to Cloud Healthcare API resources .
You might also be able to get the required permissions through
custom roles or other
predefined roles .
Note : If you created a Google Cloud project for this guide, then, as the project creator, you're automatically granted the Owner ( roles/owner ) IAM role, which has the permissions. You don't need to be granted any additional IAM roles.
Console
The Google Cloud console doesn't support editing a dataset. Instead, use
the Google Cloud CLI or the REST API.
gcloud
Run the gcloud healthcare datasets update command.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION : the dataset location
DATASET_ID : the dataset ID
TIME_ZONE : a supported time zone, such as UTC
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;

Get dataset details
The following samples show how to get details about a dataset.
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles:
Permissions
healthcare.datasets.get
Roles
Healthcare Dataset Viewer
( roles/healthcare.datasetViewer )
Healthcare Dataset Administrator
( roles/healthcare.datasetAdmin )
You can ask your administrator to grant you these Identity and Access Management roles. For instructions on
granting roles, see Manage access or
Control access to Cloud Healthcare API resources .
You might also be able to get the required permissions through
custom roles or other
predefined roles .
Note : If you created a Google Cloud project for this guide, then, as the project creator, you're automatically granted the Owner ( roles/owner ) IAM role, which has the permissions. You don't need to be granted any additional IAM roles.
