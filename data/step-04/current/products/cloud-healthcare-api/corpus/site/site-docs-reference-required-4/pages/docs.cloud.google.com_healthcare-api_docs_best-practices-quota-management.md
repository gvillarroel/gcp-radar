Quota management best practices
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes best practices for managing Cloud Healthcare API
quota . Use this page if your Google Cloud project has, or might
have, a large amount of traffic and you need more quota than what the
Cloud Healthcare API provides by default.
Cloud Healthcare API default quotas
The default Cloud Healthcare API quotas
aren't designed for all use cases, particularly if your Google Cloud project
has a large amount of traffic. The Cloud Healthcare API
doesn't automatically grow quota. You must plan and monitor your quota usage.
Best practices for monitoring and viewing quota
There are several methods for viewing your quota usage .
When estimating and viewing quota for the Cloud Healthcare API, we recommend
that you use the Service Quota Model .
The model lets you accurately assess the available quota you have based on the
following criteria:
Whether an admin override is present. A principal granted the Quota Administrator
role in an organization can apply an admin override to quota in
Google Cloud projects within the organization.
An admin override supersedes default limits and producer overrides.
Whether a producer override is present. A service owner grants a producer override
to a consumer of a service. Google Cloud is the
service owner of the Cloud Healthcare API service. Any quota
override that Google Cloud provides is a producer override.
Important: Admin overrides supersede producer overrides. If you have been
granted additional quota using a producer override, but you
have an existing admin override, the producer override might not take effect.
Whether a consumer override is present. Someone who makes requests to the
Cloud Healthcare API is a consumer of the Cloud Healthcare API service. You can
apply consumer overrides for various situations, such as limiting quotas in your
Google Cloud project as a cost-control measure to prevent going over your
budget.
If you have any of these overrides in effect, you can compute your consumer quota limit
to get an accurate assessment of your available quota.
Best practices for requesting additional quota
Google Cloud has procedures to
request a higher quota value .
To learn how quota adjustment requests are processed, see
About quota adjustments .
Before requesting additional quota, ensure that you've implemented
both of the following:
Exponential backoff
Client-side rate limiting
These implementations might reduce the amount of quota you require for the
following reasons:
Both implementations spread load spikes out across several hours or minutes,
rather than seconds.
Both implementations make efficient use of quota over a 24 hour period. If
requests that significantly exceed the default quota are consistent over a 24 hour period,
larger pools of resources can be
allocated to the Cloud Healthcare API service. The additional allocation of
resources is by request only
and is determined on a case-by-case basis.
Consistent resource usage makes it simpler for Google Cloud to understand
your quota requirements and provide you with the quota you need.
To manage your capacity and quota effectively, you need to know your
organization's capacity requirements. If you're planning your capacity requirements
and think that you'll need a large quota increase when your Google Cloud project is in production,
request an increase from Google Cloud Customer Care . Customer
Care can assist you with allocating and increasing quota during the testing
and rollout phases of your Google Cloud project.
You don't need to have a paid Customer Care service to request a quota increase.
Some quota increase requests are completed within 2-3 business days, but
we recommend that you plan for longer. If your quota increase is large, it can take 10 business days or
more for the quota increase request to be completed. Part of your planning
must involve allocating time to respond to Customer Care to resolve any questions
or open issues about the request. If you ensure that your initial quota increase
request is sufficiently detailed, you might be able to reduce the time spent
waiting for the request to be fulfilled.
Best practices for anticipating quota needs
Before your Google Cloud project goes into production, anticipate and plan
for how much quota you will need. Planning your quota requirements prevents
unexpected limiting of your resource consumption later.
The following sections explain what to consider
when planning for quota.
Anticipate total usage for all data stores and clients
Understand your total usage across all Cloud Healthcare API data stores ,
and understand the total usage of all clients that make requests to your
Google Cloud project.
Some Google Cloud projects implement multiple Cloud Healthcare API use cases.
For example, your Google Cloud project might use multiple Cloud Healthcare API datasets
and data stores for different types of data, thus increasing your total
quota usage.
Quotas are enforced on a per-Google Cloud-project and per-region basis.
Ensure that you have accurate measurements of your required quota across
multiple regions. If you have multiple Google Cloud projects,
you might need more accurate measurements across the
projects. For more information on planning for quota per-region, see
Anticipate per-region usage .
The Cloud Healthcare API doesn't load balance quota across clients, datasets, or
data stores. The client must determine whether to implement a prioritization
scheme to ensure that the most critical traffic doesn't encounter
429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED errors.
Anticipate per-region usage
Cloud Healthcare API measures quotas at a per-Google Cloud-project and per-region basis. Quotas
are typically measured per minute, which allows for small spikes of requests
per second to balance out on a per-minute scale.
If your Google Cloud project uses multiple regions, you can set per-region
quotas.
If your Cloud Healthcare API dataset is in the us
multi-regional location, and you want to request additional quota, state
in your quota request that the quota is for the "US meta region". The us
multi-regional location consists of the following subregions:
us-central1
us-east1
us-west1
If you already have Cloud Healthcare API traffic using quota in any of the
us- subregions, ensure that you take the existing traffic in those subregions
into account when making a quota increase request for the us multi-region.
For example, if you have datasets in us-central1 and us ,
and you request a quota increase in us , specify in your request that you
have datasets in us-central1 .
Favor low-volume transactions on a consistent basis
The following scenario explains the importance of
sending smaller amounts of traffic on a consistent basis instead of sending
high-volume transactions with a longer interval between transactions.
Traffic volume is calculated using the formula request payload * time = traffic volume .
A high-volume transaction is one or more requests to the
Cloud Healthcare API in a short interval that contain a large payload.
A series of requests can also be considered high-volume if there are
many requests sent over a short interval, regardless of the payload size.
Suppose that a client collects high-volume transactions and sends the
transactions to the Cloud Healthcare API in a burst every five minutes. The
following occurs:
The initial burst of traffic consumes quota in the first minute (dependent on
minute rollovers) until all quota is exhausted.
Any remaining burst traffic receives 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED errors. If
configured, all affected requests encounter exponential backoff.
Some percentage of requests that encountered the initial exponential backoff are
rescheduled to be tried again in the next minute. Some requests are attempted
multiple times in a single minute, and then are retried the next minute.
If the request volume is high enough, retried requests might encounter
429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED errors and exponential backoff again. Certain
bursts of traffic might encounter exponential backoff at different times,
and the attempts to send traffic again might converge on the same minute
in the future.
If the request volume is still high, some traffic is retried when the next
burst of traffic begins. The issue is exacerbated because more traffic
is added to the existing backlog of requests. Your application might have
difficulty maintaining the backlog of requests and sending them consistently
to the Cloud Healthcare API.
This scenario shows the importance of knowing the volume of your traffic on
a per-minute basis. Implement your traffic volume and backoffs to prevent
network congestion and ensure that your application doesn't encounter
many failures that require retries.
