Healthcare Natural Language API
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Caution: The Healthcare Natural Language API is deprecated and will be shut down
on May 27, 2026. For more information, see
Deprecations .
The Healthcare Natural Language API is a part of the Cloud Healthcare API that
uses natural language models to extract healthcare information from medical
text.
This conceptual guide explains the basics of using the
Healthcare Natural Language API, including:
The types of requests you can make to the Healthcare Natural Language API
How to construct requests to the Healthcare Natural Language API
How to handle responses from the Healthcare Natural Language API
Overview
The Healthcare Natural Language API extracts healthcare information from
medical text. This healthcare information can include:
Medical concepts, such as medications, procedures, and medical conditions
Functional features, such as temporal relationships, subjects, and certainty
assessments
Relations, such as side effects and medication dosage
Note: You don't need to create a dataset in the Cloud Healthcare API to use
the Healthcare Natural Language API.
Choosing between the Healthcare Natural Language API and AutoML Entity Extraction for Healthcare
The Healthcare Natural Language API offers pre-trained natural language models to
extract medical concepts and relationships from medical text. The
Healthcare Natural Language API maps text into a predefined set of
medical knowledge categories .
AutoML Entity Extraction for Healthcare lets you create a custom
entity extraction model trained using your own annotated medical text and using
your own categories. For more information, see the
AutoML Entity Extraction for Healthcare documentation .
Available locations
The Healthcare Natural Language API is available in the following locations:

australia-southeast1
Sydney, Australia
europe-west2
London, UK
europe-west4

Healthcare Natural Language API features
The Healthcare Natural Language API inspects medical text for medical concepts and
relations. You perform entity analysis using the
analyzeEntities
method.
Entity analysis requests
The Healthcare Natural Language API is a REST API and consists of JSON requests
and responses. The following sections show how to extract different medical
insights from a given medical text:
Extract entities, relations, and contextual attributes
Include licensed vocabularies
Extract output as a FHIR R4 bundle
The entity analysis request contains the following fields:
documentContent :
The data for the request, which consists of medical text. The maximum size of
the medical text is 20,000 Unicode characters.
licensedVocabularies[] :
Optional. The SNOMED CT vocabulary. Available only for US users.
alternativeOutputFormat :
Optional. The FHIR bundle format.
Entity analysis response fields
The entity analysis returns a set of detected medical knowledge mentions, medical
concepts, and relations between medical knowledge mentions, including the
following:
entityMentions : occurrences of medical knowledge entities in the source
medical text. Each entity mention has the following fields:
mentionId : a unique identifier for an entity mention in the response.
type : the
medical knowledge category of
the entity mention.
text : consists of the textContent field, and describes the excerpt of
the medical text containing the entity mention, and offset , the location
of the entity mention in the source medical text.
temporalAssessment : specifies how the linked entity relates to the
entity mention, one of CURRENT , CLINICAL_HISTORY ,
FAMILY_HISTORY , UPCOMING , or OTHER .
certaintyAssessment : the negation or qualification of the medical
concept, one of LIKELY , SOMEWHAT_LIKELY , UNCERTAIN ,
SOMEWHAT_UNLIKELY , UNLIKELY , or CONDITIONAL .
subject : specifies the subject that the medical concept relates to,
one of PATIENT , FAMILY_MEMBER , or OTHER .
linkedEntities : a list of medical concepts that might be related to this
entity mention. Linked entities specify the entityId , which
links a medical concept to an an entity in entities .
entities : describes the medical concepts from the linked entities fields.
Each entity is described using the following fields:
entityId : a unique identifier from the linkedEntities field.
preferredTerm : a preferred term for the medical concept.
vocabularyCodes : the representation of the medical concept in
supported medical vocabularies .
relationships : define directed relationships between entity mentions.
In the sample, the subject of the relationship is "Insulin regimen human" and
the object of the relationship is "5 units".
confidence : an indication of the model's confidence in the relationship as a
number between 0 and 1.
Apart from the listed fields, the response might also contain the additionalInfo
field, which states any additional description about the entity mention type.
See Additional information .

Certainty assessments, returned in the certaintyAssessment field, describe
the original note taker's confidence. For example, if the original note
contains "The patient has a sore throat", the certainty assessment
returns a LIKELY value to indicate the note taker's confidence that it
was likely that the patient had a sore throat. If the original note contains "The patient does
not have a sore throat", the certainty assessment returns an UNLIKELY
value to indicate the note taker's confidence that it was unlikely
that the patient had a sore throat.
Certainty assessments can be one of the following values:

Healthcare Natural Language API output as a FHIR bundle
When you request the analyzeEntities method with the
alternativeOutputFormat
field set to FHIR_BUNDLE , the response includes the following JSON objects:
The entity mentions, the entities, and the relationships
A FHIR R4 bundle represented as a string, that includes all the entities, the
