Controlling access to Cloud Healthcare API resources
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to control access to Cloud Healthcare API datasets
and data stores using
Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. IAM lets you
control who has access to your datasets and data stores. To learn more about
IAM for the Cloud Healthcare API, see
Access control .
Overview of IAM policies
Access to a resource is managed through an IAM policy . A
policy contains an array, called bindings . This array contains a collection
of bindings , which are associations between principals, such as a user
account or service account, and a role. Policies are represented using JSON
or YAML.
The following sample policy shows user-1@example.com that has been
granted the roles/healthcare.datasetAdmin role and user-2@example.com and
service-account-13@appspot.gserviceaccount.com have been granted the
roles/healthcare.datasetViewer role:
{
"etag" : " bytes " ,
"bindings" : [
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.datasetAdmin" ,
"members" : [
"user:user-1@example.com"
]
},
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.datasetViewer" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service-account-13@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ,
"user:user-2@example.com"
]
}
]
}
To update a policy for a resource, use the
read-modify-write
pattern. There are no separate methods for creating, modifying, and revoking
user access.
To update a policy, complete the following steps:
Read the current policy by calling the resource's getIamPolicy() method.
For example, to read a dataset's current policy, call
projects.locations.datasets.getIamPolicy .
Edit the returned policy, either by using a text editor or programmatically,
to add or remove any applicable principals and their role grants.
Write the updated policy by calling the resource's setIamPolicy() method.
For example, to write a dataset's updated policy, call
projects.locations.datasets.setIamPolicy .
Using IAM with consent stores
The following sections show how to get, modify, and set a policy for a consent
store. These sections use the following sample policy as a starting point:
{
"etag" : " bytes " ,
"bindings" : [
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.consentStoreAdmin" ,
"members" : [
"user:user-1@example.com"
]
},
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.consentReader" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service-account-13@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ,
"user:user-2@example.com"
]
}
]
}
Getting a policy
The following samples show how to read a consent store-level IAM
policy. For more information, see
projects.locations.datasets.consentStores.getIamPolicy .
Console
To view the IAM policy for a consent store:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Datasets page.
Go to Datasets
Click the ID of the dataset that contains the consent store and then
select the consent store that you want to get a policy for.
Click Show info panel .
To view the principals assigned to a role, expand the role.
gcloud
To view the IAM policy for a consent store, run the
gcloud healthcare consent-stores get-iam-policy
command. Specify the consent store name, the dataset name, and the location.
gcloud healthcare consent-stores get-iam-policy CONSENT_STORE_ID \
--dataset = DATASET_ID \
--location = LOCATION
If the request is successful, the bindings are displayed.

Modifying a policy
The following samples grant a new user the roles/healthcare.consentReader
role. For more information, see projects.locations.datasets.consentStores.setIamPolicy .
Setting a policy
Console
To set a consent store-level IAM policy, complete the following
steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Datasets page.
Go to Datasets
Click the ID of the dataset that contains the consent store and then select
the consent store that you want to set a policy for.
Click Show info panel .
Click Add principal .
In the New principals field, enter one or more identities
that need access to the consent store.
In the Select a role list, under
Cloud Healthcare , select the permission that you
want to grant. For example, Healthcare Consent Store Viewer.
Click Save .
gcloud
Grant or revoke roles to users by modifying the policy that you retrieved, programmatically or using
a text editor. The etag value changes when the policy changes, so you must specify the
current value.
To grant a new user the role, append their email address to the members
array under the roles/healthcare.consentReader binding:
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.consentReader" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service-account-13@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ,
"user:user-2@example.com" ,
"user: NEW_USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS "
]
}
To revoke a principal's access, delete their email address from the members array. To
revoke access from the last principal that has a role, delete the bindings array for
the role. You cannot have an empty bindings array in your policy.
After you have modified the policy to grant the applicable roles, run the
appropriate set-iam-policy command to make the changes. To set a consent
store-level policy, run the
gcloud healthcare consent-stores set-iam-policy
command. Specify the consent store name, the dataset name, the location, and the
path to the policy file that you created.
gcloud healthcare consent-stores set-iam-policy CONSENT_STORE_ID \
--dataset = DATASET_ID \
--location = LOCATION \
POLICY_FILE_NAME
If the request is successful, the consent store name and the bindings are
displayed.
Updated IAM policy for consentStore [ CONSENT_STORE_ID ].

Modifying a policy
The following samples grant a new user the roles/healthcare.datasetViewer
role:
Setting a policy
Console
To set a dataset-level IAM policy, complete the following
steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Datasets page.
Go to Datasets
Select the dataset that you want to set a policy for and then click
Show info panel .
Click Add principal .
In the New principals field, enter one or more identities
that need access to the dataset.
In the Select a role list, under Cloud Healthcare , select
the permission that you want to grant. For example, Healthcare Dataset Viewer.
Click Save .
gcloud
Grant or revoke roles to users by modifying the policy that you retrieved, programmatically or using
a text editor. The etag value changes when the policy changes, so you must specify the
current value.
To grant a new user the role, append their email address to the members
array under the roles/healthcare.datasetViewer binding:
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.datasetViewer" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service-account-13@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ,
"user:user-2@example.com" ,
"user: NEW_USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS "
]
}
To revoke a principal's access, delete their email address from the members array. To
revoke access from the last principal that has a role, delete the bindings array for
the role. You cannot have an empty bindings array in your policy.
After you have modified the policy to grant the applicable roles, run the
appropriate set-iam-policy command to make the changes. To set a
dataset-level policy, run the
gcloud healthcare datasets set-iam-policy
command. Specify the dataset name, the location, and the path to the policy file that you created.
gcloud healthcare datasets set-iam-policy DATASET_ID \
--location = LOCATION \
POLICY_FILE_NAME
If the request is successful, the dataset name and the bindings are displayed.
Updated IAM policy for dataset [ DATASET_ID ].

After you have modified the policy to grant the applicable roles, call
projects.locations.datasets.setIamPolicy
to make the updates.
To set a dataset-level IAM policy, make a POST
request and specify the name of the dataset, the policy, and an access
token.
The following sample shows a POST request using curl to grant a new user the
existing roles/healthcare.datasetViewer role:

Grant or revoke roles to users by modifying the policy that you retrieved, programmatically or using
a text editor. The etag value changes when the policy changes, so you must specify the
current value.
To grant a new user the role, append their email address to the members
array under the roles/healthcare.dicomViewer binding:
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.dicomViewer" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service-account-13@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ,
"user:user-2@example.com" ,
"user: NEW_USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS "
]
}
To revoke a principal's access, delete their email address from the members array. To
revoke access from the last principal that has a role, delete the bindings array for
the role. You cannot have an empty bindings array in your policy.
After you have modified the policy to grant the applicable roles, run the
appropriate set-iam-policy command to make the changes. To set a DICOM
store-level policy, run the
gcloud healthcare dicom-stores set-iam-policy
command. Specify the DICOM store name, the dataset name, the location, and the
path to the policy file that you created.
gcloud healthcare dicom-stores set-iam-policy DICOM_STORE_ID \
--dataset = DATASET_ID \
--location = LOCATION \

If the request is successful, the DICOM store name and the bindings are
displayed.

Modifying a policy
The following samples grant a new user the roles/healthcare.fhirResourceReader
role. For more information, see projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores.setIamPolicy .
Setting a policy
Console
To set a FHIR store-level IAM policy, complete the following
steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Datasets page.
Go to Datasets
Click the ID of the dataset that contains the FHIR store and then
select the FHIR store that you want to set a policy for.
Click Show info panel .
Click Add principal .
In the New principals field, enter one or more identities
that need access to the FHIR store.
In the Select a role list, under
Cloud Healthcare , select the permission that you want to
grant. For example, Healthcare FHIR Resource Reader.
Click Save .
gcloud
Grant or revoke roles to users by modifying the policy that you retrieved, programmatically or using
a text editor. The etag value changes when the policy changes, so you must specify the
current value.
To grant a new user the role, append their email address to the members array
under the roles/healthcare.fhirResourceReader binding:
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.fhirResourceReader" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service-account-13@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ,
"user:user-2@example.com" ,
"user: NEW_USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS "
]
}
To revoke a principal's access, delete their email address from the members array. To
revoke access from the last principal that has a role, delete the bindings array for
the role. You cannot have an empty bindings array in your policy.
After you have modified the policy to grant the applicable roles, run the
appropriate set-iam-policy command to make the changes.
To set a FHIR store-level policy, run the
gcloud healthcare fhir-stores set-iam-policy
command. Specify the FHIR store name, the dataset name, the location, and the
path to the policy file that you created.
gcloud healthcare fhir-stores set-iam-policy FHIR_STORE_ID \
--dataset = DATASET_ID \
--location = LOCATION \
POLICY_FILE_NAME
If the request is successful, the FHIR store name and the bindings are displayed.

Modifying a policy
The following samples grant a new user the roles/healthcare.hl7V2Consumer
role. For more information, see projects.locations.datasets.hl7V2Stores.setIamPolicy .
Setting a policy
Console
To set an HL7v2 store-level IAM policy, complete the following
steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Datasets page.
Go to Datasets
Click the ID of the dataset that contains the HL7v2 store and then select
the HL7v2 store that you want to set a policy for.
Click Show info panel .
Click Add principal .
In the New principals field, enter one or more identities
that need access to the HL7v2 store.
In the Select a role list, under
Cloud Healthcare , select the permission that you
want to grant. For example, Healthcare HL7v2 Message Consumer.
Click Save .
gcloud
Grant or revoke roles to users by modifying the policy that you retrieved, programmatically or using
a text editor. The etag value changes when the policy changes, so you must specify the
current value.
To grant a new user the role, append their email address to the members array
under the roles/healthcare.hl7V2Consumer binding:
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.hl7V2Consumer" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service-account-13@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ,
"user:user-2@example.com" ,
"user: NEW_USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS "
]
}
To revoke a principal's access, delete their email address from the members array. To
revoke access from the last principal that has a role, delete the bindings array for
the role. You cannot have an empty bindings array in your policy.
After you have modified the policy to grant the applicable roles, run the
appropriate set-iam-policy command to make the changes.
To set an HL7v2 store-level policy, run the
gcloud healthcare hl7v2-stores set-iam-policy
command. Specify the HL7v2 store name, the dataset name, the location, and the
path to the policy file that you created.
gcloud healthcare hl7v2-stores set-iam-policy HL7V2_STORE_ID \
--dataset = DATASET_ID \
--location = LOCATION \

If the request is successful, the HL7v2 store name and the bindings are
displayed.

Grant or revoke roles to users by modifying the policy that you retrieved, programmatically or using
a text editor. The etag value changes when the policy changes, so you must specify the
current value.
To grant a new user the role, append their email address to the members array
under the roles/healthcare.hl7V2Consumer binding:
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.hl7V2Consumer" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service-account-13@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ,
"user:user-2@example.com" ,
"user: NEW_USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS "
]
}
To revoke a principal's access, delete their email address from the members array. To
revoke access from the last principal that has a role, delete the bindings array for
the role. You cannot have an empty bindings array in your policy.
After you have modified the policy to grant the applicable roles, call
projects.locations.datasets.hl7V2Stores.setIamPolicy
to make the updates.
To set an HL7v2 store-level IAM policy, make a POST
request and specify the name of the dataset, the name of the HL7v2 store, the
policy, and an access token.
The following sample shows a POST request using curl to grant a new user the
existing roles/healthcare.hl7V2Consumer role:
The policy can be written directly in the request, as shown here, or it
can be passed in as a JSON or YAML file. For examples of how to format a policy as JSON or
YAML, see Policy .

Using IAM with the Healthcare Natural Language API
The following sections show how to get, modify, and set a policy for the
Healthcare Natural Language API. These sections use the following sample policy as
a starting point:
{
"etag" : " bytes " ,
"bindings" : [
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.nlpServiceViewer" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service-account-13@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
]
}
]
}
Getting a policy
The following samples show how to read a project-level IAM
policy. For more information, see the
projects.getIamPolicy
method.

Grant or revoke roles to users by modifying the policy that you retrieved, programmatically or using
a text editor. The etag value changes when the policy changes, so you must specify the
current value.
To grant a new service account the role, add the service account's email
address to the members array under the roles/healthcare.nlpServiceViewer
binding:
{
"role" : "roles/healthcare.nlpServiceViewer" ,
"members" : [
"serviceAccount:service-account-13@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ,
"serviceAccount: NEW_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_ADDRESS "
]
}
To revoke a principal's access, delete their email address from the members array. To
revoke access from the last principal that has a role, delete the bindings array for
the role. You cannot have an empty bindings array in your policy.
After you have modified the policy to grant the applicable roles, run the
gcloud projects set-iam-policy
command to make the changes. Specify the project and the path to the policy file
that you created.
