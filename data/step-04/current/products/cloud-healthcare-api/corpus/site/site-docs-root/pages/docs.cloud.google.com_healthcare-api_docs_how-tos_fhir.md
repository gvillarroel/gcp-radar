Creating and managing FHIR stores
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to create, edit, view, list, and delete Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (FHIR) stores. FHIR stores hold FHIR resources, such
as Claim resources, Patient resources, Medication resources, and more.
Note: Changes to a FHIR store might not take effect immediately. To ensure data consistency in the FHIR server, wait for the server to return a response between sending requests.
The Cloud Healthcare API supports the following FHIR versions:
DSTU2
STU3
R4
R5
Creating a FHIR store
Before you can create a FHIR store, you need to
create a dataset .
The following samples show how to create a FHIR store using the
projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores.create
method.
Important: FHIR stores only support the UTF-8 character set. The Cloud Healthcare API
rejects FHIR resources if they contain any characters not in the UTF-8 character set.
Console
To create a FHIR store, complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Datasets page.
Go to Datasets
Select the dataset where you want to create a FHIR store.
Click Create Data Store .
Select FHIR as the data store type.
Enter a name that's unique in your dataset. If the name is not unique, the FHIR store creation
fails.
Click Next .
To configure your FHIR store, do the following:
Choose the FHIR version for the FHIR store, one of DSTU2 ,
STU3 , or R4 .
Select the applicable advanced settings from the following:
Allow update create : Select to allow creation of a new resource using an update
operation with a user-specified ID.
Referential integrity checks : Select to enable referential integrity in this store.
This can't be changed after creating the store.
Resource versioning : Select to automatically record historical versions of resources.
This can't be changed after creating the store.
Select the applicable profile validation settings from the following fields. For more information,
see ValidationConfig :
Enable profile validation : Select to enable profile validation. To enforce an
implementation guide that's enabled in your FHIR store, you must enable profile
validation.
Enable required field validation : Select to enable resource field validation
against the structure definitions in your FHIR profile.
Enable reference type validation : Select to enable reference type validation.
Enable FHIRPath validation : Select to enable FHIRPath compatibility check.
Click Next .
Optional: To enable implementation guides in your FHIR store, do the following:
Click Enable implementation guides .
Click and expand the Implementation guides list.
Select the applicable implementation guides in the list.
Each implementation guide supports a specific FHIR version. The list shows only those
implementation guides that are compatible with the selected FHIR store version.
Click Import custom IG from Cloud Storage to import any custom profile validation
bundle from a Cloud Storage location.
In the Select object panel, select a profile validation bundle resource from a
Cloud Storage location. For more information, see
Use Google Cloud console to enable implementation guides .
Click Select .
The selected implementation guides are listed in a table with their
version, URL, and status.
If you have enabled implementation guides but you haven't enabled profile validation,
the implementation guide doesn't come into effect.
Click Next .
Optional: To export resource changes to BigQuery each time the FHIR resources in your store
are created, updated, patched, or deleted, do the following:
Click Stream resource changes to BigQuery .
Click Add a streaming configuration . For more information on BigQuery
streaming, see Streaming FHIR resource changes to BigQuery .
Select the depth level on the Recursive structure depth slider to set the depth for
all recursive structures in the output schema. By default, the recursive depth value is 2.
Click Done to save the streaming configuration.
Click Next .
Optional: To configure a Pub/Sub topic for the FHIR store, do the following:
Click Receive Cloud Pub/Sub notifications .
Click Add a Cloud Pub/Sub topic and select the topic name.
When specifying a Pub/Sub topic, enter the qualified URI to the topic, as shown in the
following sample:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /topics/ PUBSUB_TOPIC
Click Next .
Optional: To add labels to the store, do the following:
Click Add Labels to organize your data stores .
Enter the key and value for the label. For more information on resource labels, see
Using resource labels .
Click Create .
The new FHIR store appears in the list.

Editing a FHIR store
The following samples show how to edit a FHIR store. You can edit a FHIR store to modify properties such as the following:
The Pub/Sub topic to which the Cloud Healthcare API
sends notifications of FHIR store changes.
The FHIR store's labels. Labels
are key-value pairs that help you organize your Google Cloud resources.
When specifying a Pub/Sub topic, enter the qualified URI to the topic, as shown in the
following sample:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /topics/ PUBSUB_TOPIC
For notifications to work, you must grant additional
permissions to the Cloud Healthcare Service Agent service account .
For more information, see
DICOM, FHIR, and HL7v2 store Pub/Sub permissions .
Console
To edit a FHIR store, complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Datasets page. Go to Datasets
Select the dataset containing the FHIR store you want to edit.
In the Data Stores list, select the FHIR store you want to edit.
To edit the store's configuration, click edit
FHIR store configuration .
For more information on the FHIR store's configuration options, see
Creating a FHIR store .
To edit the store's implementation guides, click edit
Implementation guides , and select the applicable implementation guides,
or import a custom implementation guide from Cloud Storage. For more
information, see
Use Google Cloud console to enable implementation guides .
To edit the implementation guides, or enforce the enabled implementation
guides, you must enable profile validation in the
FHIR store configuration section.
To export resource changes to BigQuery each time the FHIR
resources in your store are created, updated, patched, or deleted, click
Add new streaming config in the Dataset field.
Select a BigQuery dataset where resource changes will be
streamed. For more information on BigQuery streaming, see
Streaming FHIR resource changes to BigQuery .
To set the depth for all recursive structures in the output schema, click
the relevant depth in the Recursive Structure Depth slider. By default,
the recursive depth is 2.
To export resource changes only for specific resource types, select the
resource types from the Select FHIR resource types list.
To configure a Pub/Sub topic for the data store, select a topic
name in the Cloud Pub/Sub Notifications section.
When specifying a Pub/Sub topic, enter the qualified URI to the topic, as shown in the
following sample:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /topics/ PUBSUB_TOPIC
To add one or more labels to the store, click
edit Labels , click Add label and enter the key/value label. For
more information on resource labels, see Using resource labels .
Click Save .

Getting the capabilities or conformance statement for a FHIR store
The following samples show how to get the
capabilities ( STU3

or conformance (DSTU2)
statement for a FHIR store.
The information in the capabilities or conformance statement reflects the
settings in the FHIR store. For example, if
FhirStore.enableUpdateCreate
is set to true , then this is reflected in the capabilities statement's
CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.updateCreate field.
The following table shows the Cloud Healthcare API method for getting the
capabilities or conformance statement for a FHIR store and its equivalent FHIR
specification interaction:
Cloud Healthcare API method
FHIR specification interaction
projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores.fhir.capabilities
capabilities ( STU3 or R4 or R5 ) or conformance (DSTU2)

Setting the base resource validation level
By default, all resources in your FHIR store have base resource validation
applied to them. This validation ensures that the following are true
when the resource is created:
All required fields are defined.
All referred resource types are valid.
The resource meets all FHIRPath constraints.
You can make your base resource validation less strict by disabling one or more
of these types of base resource validation for your FHIR store.
Console
The Google Cloud console and the gcloud CLI don't support this action. Instead, use curl , PowerShell, or your preferred language.
gcloud
The Google Cloud console and the gcloud CLI don't support this action. Instead, use curl , PowerShell, or your preferred language.
REST
To disable base resource validation in an existing FHIR store, use the projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores.patch method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project
DATASET_ID : the FHIR store's parent dataset
LOCATION : the dataset location
BASE_RESOURCE_VALIDATION_TYPE : the base resource validation type you want to disable. To disable validation, set any of the following fields to true :
disableRequiredFieldValidation
disableReferenceTypeValidation
disableFhirpathValidation
Request JSON body:
{
"validationConfig": {
" BASE_RESOURCE_VALIDATION_TYPE ": true
}
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json .
Run the following command in the terminal to create or overwrite
this file in the current directory:
cat > request.json BASE_RESOURCE_VALIDATION_TYPE ": true
}
}
EOF
Then execute the following command to send your REST request:
curl -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://healthcare.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /fhirStores/ FHIR_STORE_ID ?updateMask=validationConfig"

Copy the request body and open the
method reference page .
The APIs Explorer panel opens on the right side of the page.
You can interact with this tool to send requests.
Paste the request body in this tool, complete any other required fields, and click Execute .
You should receive a response similar to the following.
If you configured any fields in the FhirStore resource, they also appear in the response.

Deleting a FHIR store
Caution: Deleting a FHIR store also deletes the resources in the
FHIR store. If deleted, these resources cannot be recovered.
The following samples show how to delete a FHIR store.
Console
To delete a data store:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Datasets page.
Go to Datasets
Select the dataset containing the data store you want to delete.
Choose Delete from the Actions drop-down list for the data store that you want to delete.
To confirm, type the data store name and then click Delete .
gcloud
To delete a FHIR store, run the gcloud healthcare fhir-stores delete command.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
LOCATION : the dataset location
DATASET_ID : the FHIR store's parent dataset
FHIR_STORE_ID : the FHIR store ID
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
Note:
Ensure you have initialized the Google Cloud CLI with authentication and a project
by running either
gcloud init ;
or
gcloud auth login
and
gcloud config set project .
gcloud healthcare fhir-stores delete FHIR_STORE_ID \
--dataset = DATASET_ID \
--location = LOCATION
