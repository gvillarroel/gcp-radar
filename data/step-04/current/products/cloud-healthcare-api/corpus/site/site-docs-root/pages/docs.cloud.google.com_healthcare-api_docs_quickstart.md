Store healthcare data with curl and PowerShell
This page shows you how to use the Cloud Healthcare API and curl or PowerShell
to complete the following tasks:
Create a Cloud Healthcare API dataset.
Create one of the following data stores inside the dataset:
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) store
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) store
Health Level Seven International Version 2 (HL7v2) store
Store and inspect a particular type of medical data in the DICOM, FHIR, or HL7v2 store.
If you're only interested in working with one type of data store, you can skip
directly to that section of the quickstart after completing the steps in
Before you begin and Create a dataset .
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Create a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with a name for the Google Cloud project you are creating.
Select the Google Cloud project that you created:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project name.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Enable the Cloud Healthcare API:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable healthcare.googleapis.com
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/healthcare.datasetAdmin, roles/healthcare.fhirStoreAdmin, roles/healthcare.dicomStoreAdmin, roles/healthcare.hl7V2StoreAdmin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
Create or select a Google Cloud project .
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.

role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable healthcare.googleapis.com
Grant roles to your user account. Run the following command once for each of the following
IAM roles:
roles/healthcare.datasetAdmin, roles/healthcare.fhirStoreAdmin, roles/healthcare.dicomStoreAdmin, roles/healthcare.hl7V2StoreAdmin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member = "user: USER_IDENTIFIER " --role = ROLE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
USER_IDENTIFIER : The identifier for your user
account. For example, myemail@example.com .
ROLE : The IAM role that you grant to your user account.
Create a dataset
Datasets contain data stores, and data stores contain healthcare data.
To use the Cloud Healthcare API, you must create at least one dataset.
The following sample shows how to create a dataset named my-dataset in the
us-central1 region. You use the dataset throughout this quickstart to
create DICOM stores, FHIR stores, and HL7v2 stores.

After storing and viewing the HL7v2 message in the Cloud Healthcare API,
continue to Clean up to avoid incurring charges to
your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this page.
For more information on working with HL7v2 data, see What's next .
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, delete the Google Cloud project with the
resources.
If you created a new project for this quickstart,
follow the steps in Delete the project . Otherwise, follow the
steps in Delete the dataset .
Optional: Revoke credentials from the gcloud CLI.
gcloud auth revoke
Delete the project
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
Delete a Google Cloud project:
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
Delete the dataset
If you no longer need the dataset created in this quickstart, you can delete
it. Deleting a dataset permanently deletes the dataset and any FHIR,
HL7v2, or DICOM stores it contains.
REST
Delete the dataset using the projects.locations.datasets.delete method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud project that you created or selected in Before you begin
