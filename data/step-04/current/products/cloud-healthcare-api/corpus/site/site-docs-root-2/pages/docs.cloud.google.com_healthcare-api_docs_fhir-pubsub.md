FHIR Pub/Sub notifications
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to use Pub/Sub
to get notifications when a clinical event occurs in a FHIR store.
You can use Pub/Sub notifications for multiple use cases, including
triggering downstream processing or analysis of new data. For example, a
machine learning model can receive
notifications when new data is available for training and generate
insights or predictions to improve patient care.
Overview
You can receive Pub/Sub notifications when a FHIR resource is
created, updated, patched, or deleted in a FHIR store. The Cloud Healthcare API doesn't
send notifications when a FHIR resource is imported from Cloud Storage .
To receive notifications, you must create a Pub/Sub topic and
subscription, and then configure the FHIR store to send notifications to the
topic.
The following diagram shows how Pub/Sub notifications are created
and delivered when a FHIR resource is created in a FHIR store using the
fhir.create
method. The steps are the same when a FHIR resource is updated, patched, or deleted.
Figure 1. Using Pub/Sub notifications for changes in a FHIR store.
Figure 1 shows the following steps:
A caller makes a fhirStores.fhir.create request to create a FHIR resource.
The FHIR store receives the request, creates a Pub/Sub
message, and sends it to the Pub/Sub topic configured on the FHIR store.
Pub/Sub forwards the message to the subscriptions attached
to the topic.
The subscribers receive a notification, in the form of a
Pub/Sub message, from their subscription. Each subscription
can have one or more subscribers for increased parallelism.
Notification configuration
You can configure Pub/Sub notifications and their behavior in a
FhirNotificationConfig
object on a FHIR store. Each FHIR store can have multiple FhirNotificationConfig
configured.
The following table describes the fields in the FhirNotificationConfig
object.
Caution: FHIR resource information might contain protected health information
(PHI). Use caution when sending PHI in a Pub/Sub message.
Field
Description
Example
pubsubTopic
The Pub/Sub topic to attach to the FHIR store. Notifications are sent to the specified topic.
projects/my-project/topics/my-topic
sendFullResource
Whether to include the full contents of a created, updated, or patched FHIR resource in a notification. This field has no effect on notifications sent when FHIR resources are deleted. To include the full contents of a deleted resource, set sendPreviousResourceOnDelete to true .
true
sendPreviousResourceOnDelete
Whether to include the full contents of a deleted FHIR resource in a notification. This field has no effect on notifications sent when FHIR resources are created, updated, or patched.
true
Notification format and content
Each Pub/Sub notification contains a message
object that holds
information about the clinical event. The message object looks
similar to the following:
{
"message": {
"attributes": {
"action": " ACTION ",
"lastUpdatedTime": " RFC_1123_FORMAT_DATETIME ",
"payloadType": " PAYLOAD_TYPE ",
"resourceType": " FHIR_RESOURCE_TYPE ",
"storeName": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /fhirStores/ FHIR_STORE_ID ",
"versionId": " VERSION_ID "
},
"data": " BASE_64_ENCODED_DATA ",
"messageId": " MESSAGE_ID ",
"publishTime": " YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+ZZ:ZZ "
}
}
For information on additional fields included in each Pub/Sub message,
see ReceivedMessage
and PubsubMessage .
The following table describes each field in the attributes object:
Attribute
Description
Example
action
The action that occurred on a FHIR resource. Possible values include: CreateResource
PatchResource
UpdateResource
DeleteResource
CreateResource
resourceType
The type of FHIR resource that was modified. Possible values include any supported FHIR resource type in the Cloud Healthcare API.
Patient
payloadType
The payload type of the message, one of NameOnly or FullResource .
FullResource
storeName
The full resource name of the FHIR store where the action occurred.
projects/my-project/locations/us/datasets/my-dataset/fhirStores/my-fhir-store
lastUpdatedTime
A timestamp of the most recent time the FHIR resource was modified. The timestamp uses the RFC 1123 format.
Mon, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 UTC
versionId
The ID of the most recent version of the FHIR resource that the action occurred on. For more information on version IDs, see Listing FHIR resource versions .
MTY4MzA2MDQzOTI5NjIxMDAwMA
The following table describes the remaining fields in the message object:
Field
Description
Example
data
A base 64-encoded string of either the FHIR resource name or the FHIR resource contents, depending on the values specified in FhirNotificationConfig .
messageId
An identifier for the Pub/Sub message.
publishTime
The time at which the Pub/Sub server published the message.
Specify the information to include in notifications
Pub/Sub notifications, as detailed in
Notification format and content , include
a standard set of fields. You can include either the full FHIR resource or just
its name in each notification. The resource name contains
the full path to the resource and the resource ID in this format:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /fhirStores/ FHIR_STORE_ID /fhir/ RESOURCE_TYPE / RESOURCE_ID
FHIR resource information is stored in the data
field as a base 64-encoded string.
By including the full contents of a FHIR resource, you don't need to
to separately query Pub/Sub and the Cloud Healthcare API for resource
details.
Get the FHIR resource name
To only include the name of a FHIR resource when you create, update, or
patch the resource, set sendFullResource to false .
To only include the name when you delete a FHIR resource, set
sendPreviousResourceOnDelete to false .
When you view the notification, the message object looks similar to the following:
{
"message": {
"attributes": {
"action": " {CreateResource|PatchResource|UpdateResource|DeleteResource} ",
"lastUpdatedTime": " RFC_1123_FORMAT_DATETIME ",
"payloadType": "NameOnly",
"resourceType": " FHIR_RESOURCE_TYPE ",
"storeName": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /fhirStores/ FHIR_STORE_ID ",
"versionId": " VERSION_ID "
},
"data": " BASE64_ENCODED_FHIR_RESOURCE_NAME ",
"messageId": " MESSAGE_ID ",
"publishTime": " YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+ZZ:ZZ "
}
}
Note the following in the notification:
The payloadType field is set to NameOnly to indicate the following about
the request:
For create, update, and patch operations, sendFullResource is set to false .
For delete operations, sendPreviousResourceOnDelete is set to false .
Only the FHIR resource name is included in the data field. The name is
encoded as a base 64-encoded string.
Get created, updated, or patched FHIR resource contents
To include the full contents of a FHIR resource when you create, update, or
patch the resource, set sendFullResource to true .
This behavior doesn't apply if you delete a FHIR resource. If you delete a
FHIR resource, and sendFullResource is set to true but sendPreviousResourceOnDelete
is set to false , the notification is the same as when you only retrieve the
FHIR resource name . To include the FHIR resource
contents when a FHIR resource is deleted, see Get deleted FHIR resource contents .
When you view the notification, the message object looks similar to the following:
{
"message": {
"attributes": {
"action": " {CreateResource|PatchResource|UpdateResource} ",
"lastUpdatedTime": " RFC_1123_FORMAT_DATETIME ",
"payloadType": "FullResource",
"resourceType": " FHIR_RESOURCE_TYPE ",
"storeName": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /fhirStores/ FHIR_STORE_ID ",
"versionId": " VERSION_ID "
},
"data": " BASE64_ENCODED_FHIR_RESOURCE_CONTENTS ",
"messageId": " MESSAGE_ID ",
"publishTime": " YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+ZZ:ZZ "
}
}
Note the following in the notification:
payloadType is set to FullResource to indicate that sendFullResource is
set to true . The full contents of the FHIR resource are included in the data field
as a base 64-encoded string.
The data field contains the FHIR resource contents as a base 64-encoded string.
Get deleted FHIR resource contents
To include the full contents of a FHIR resource when you delete it,
set sendPreviousResourceOnDelete to true .
When you view the notification, the message object looks similar to the following:
{
"message": {
"attributes": {
"action": "DeleteResource",
"lastUpdatedTime": " RFC_1123_FORMAT_DATETIME ",
"payloadType": "FullResource",
"resourceType": " FHIR_RESOURCE_TYPE ",
"storeName": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /fhirStores/ FHIR_STORE_ID ",
"versionId": " VERSION_ID "
},
"data": " BASE64_ENCODED_FHIR_RESOURCE_CONTENTS ",
"messageId": " MESSAGE_ID ",
"publishTime": " YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+ZZ:ZZ "
}
}
Note the values in the following fields:
payloadType is set to FullResource even if sendFullResource is
set to false .
The full contents of the FHIR resource are included in the data field
as a base 64-encoded string.
The data field contains the contents of the FHIR resource as a base 64-encoded string
before the resource was deleted.
Configure and view FHIR notifications
The following examples show how to view the generated Pub/Sub
notification when a FHIR resource is created in a FHIR store.
Before you begin
Before configuring and using Pub/Sub notifications, complete the
following sections:
Review Pub/Sub quotas
Familiarize yourself with Pub/Sub quotas and limits .
For information about how to view quotas, requesting higher quota values, and
what happens if you run out of quota, see the
Cloud Quotas documentation .
Enable the Pub/Sub API
In the Google Cloud console, enable the Pub/Sub API:
Enable the API
Configure Pub/Sub permissions
To allow messages to be published from the Cloud Healthcare API
to Pub/Sub, you must add the pubsub.publisher role to
your project's Cloud Healthcare Service Agent service account .
See DICOM, FHIR, and HL7v2 store Pub/Sub permissions
for steps to add the required role.
Create a Pub/Sub topic
To create a topic, see Create a topic .
Individual data stores can have
their own Pub/Sub topic, or multiple data stores can share the
same topic.
Use the following format when specifying the Pub/Sub topic:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /topics/ TOPIC_NAME
PROJECT_ID is your Google Cloud project ID and
TOPIC_NAME is the name of the Pub/Sub topic.
Create a Pub/Sub subscription
To receive messages published to a topic, you need to create a
Pub/Sub subscription . Every
Pub/Sub topic needs at least one Pub/Sub
subscription. The subscription connects the topic to a subscriber application that receives
and processes messages published to the topic.
To create a subscription and attach it to a Pub/Sub topic, see
Create subscriptions .
Create or edit a FHIR store
Create or
edit
a FHIR store with a configured FhirNotificationConfig object.
The following samples show how to edit an existing FHIR store.
The sendFullResource and sendPreviousResourceOnDelete fields are set
to true , meaning that notifications contain the full FHIR resource contents
when a resource is created, updated, patched, or deleted.
REST
To edit the FHIR store, use the projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores.patch method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project
LOCATION : the dataset location
DATASET_ID : the FHIR store's parent dataset
FHIR_STORE_ID : the FHIR store ID
PUBSUB_TOPIC_ID : the Pub/Sub topic ID
Request JSON body:
{
"notificationConfigs": [
{
"pubsubTopic": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /topics/ PUBSUB_TOPIC_ID ",
"sendFullResource": true,
"sendPreviousResourceOnDelete": true
}
]
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json .
Run the following command in the terminal to create or overwrite
this file in the current directory:
cat > request.json PROJECT_ID /topics/ PUBSUB_TOPIC_ID ",
"sendFullResource": true,
"sendPreviousResourceOnDelete": true
}
]
}
EOF
Then execute the following command to send your REST request:
curl -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://healthcare.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID /fhirStores/ FHIR_STORE_ID ?updateMask=notificationConfigs"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running

Create a FHIR resource
Create a FHIR resource
in the FHIR store. The request causes the Cloud Healthcare API to publish a
message to the configured Pub/Sub topic.
View the Pub/Sub notification
View the message published to the Pub/Sub topic. The following message
was generated when a Patient resource was created in a FHIR store.
In the sample output, the contents of the FHIR resource are in a base64-encoded
string in the data field. You must decode the base64-encoded value to get
the contents.
Most platforms and operating systems have tools for decoding base64 text.
REST
To view the message published to the Pub/Sub topic, use the
projects.subscriptions.pull
method. The following sample uses the ?maxMessages=10 query parameter to
specify the maximum number of messages to return in the request . You can adjust the value to suit your needs.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project
PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION_ID : the ID of the subscription attached to the Pub/Sub topic configured in the FHIR store
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running

Behavior when a FHIR resource is too large or traffic is high
If the size of a FHIR resource is too large, or the Cloud Healthcare API
servers are experiencing high traffic, the attributes field might
only contain the resource name instead of the full resource contents.
This behavior occurs even if sendFullResource and
sendPreviousResourceOnDelete are set to true .
To verify whether a Pub/Sub notification contains the full FHIR resource, check
the payloadType field in the response from viewing the notification.
If payloadType is set to nameOnly , then the
attributes field didn't fully populate the FHIR resource data. You must then
get the contents of the FHIR resource manually from the FHIR store instead
of from the Pub/Sub message.
Cloud Healthcare API and Pub/Sub message storage policy
To ensure that your Cloud Healthcare API data and the associated data in Pub/Sub
messages reside in the same region, you must set a Pub/Sub
message storage policy .
You must explicitly set the message storage policy on the Pub/Sub
topic configured on the data store to ensure that the data stays in the same
region. For example, if your Cloud Healthcare API dataset and FHIR store are in
us-central1 , the message storage policy must only allow the us-central1 region.
To configure a message storage policy, see Configuring message store policies .
Troubleshoot missed Pub/Sub messages
If a notification can't be published to Pub/Sub, an error is
logged to Cloud Logging . For more information, see
Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging .
If the rate of error generation exceeds a limit, errors in excess of the limit
aren't submitted to Cloud Logging.
View FHIR notifications using the NotificationConfig configuration (Deprecated)
Deprecated: Configuring FHIR notifications using the
NotificationConfig
object has been deprecated.
The FhirStore
resource contains a
