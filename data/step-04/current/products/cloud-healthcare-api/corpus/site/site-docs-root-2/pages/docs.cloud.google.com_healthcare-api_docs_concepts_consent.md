Consent and privacy overview

This page describes the Consent Management API and how to use it to manage user
consent and privacy.
The Consent Management API is a component of your consent and privacy architecture
and provides scalable and secure management of your user's consent
and data privacy. The Consent Management API stores the consent information you
receive from users, keeps track of what data is permitted for each use case, and
helps your application utilize data only as directed by your users.
Consent Management API information flow
The flow of consent and privacy information within the Consent Management API is as
follows:
Your application presents privacy options to a user, then creates or revises
a consent record within the Consent Management API to represent that user's
decision.
As your application writes data to its various data stores, your application
registers the location and characteristics of that data with your
Consent Management API instance.
When an application needs to determine whether data is consented for a particular
use case, it makes a request to the Consent Management API with the requested
data and the proposed use.
The Consent Management API compares the requested data and proposed use to the
stored consents and returns a positive response if a valid consent exists. A
negative response is returned if a valid consent doesn't exist.
The following diagram shows the Consent Management API information flow:
For more information on how consent data is organized within the
Consent Management API, see
Consent Management API data model .
Policy decision point
The Consent Management API acts as the policy decision point within your consent and
privacy architecture as follows:
Stores the consent policies granted by your applications' users.
Accepts data access queries made by authorized client applications.
Evaluates access queries against the stored consent policies.
Makes access determinations to enforce consent policies for client
applications.
Policy enforcement
The Consent Management API supports policy enforcement within your consent and
privacy architecture as follows:
Processes access determination queries made by applications or policy
enforcement points.
Evaluates if a resource can be accessed for a specified purpose.
Determines all the resources that can be accessed for a specified purpose.
Links resources to attributes and consent policies so enforcement points
only need to specify request attributes and an optional resource name.
Returns access determinations using the current consent state, even as consents are
added, updated, or revoked.
You can implement more than one policy enforcement pattern using the
Consent Management API within your consent and privacy architecture. The following
list shows examples of policy enforcement patterns:
Enforcement by trusted applications . Applications that have verified
a user's identity and qualifications can forward the relevant properties
to the Consent Management API. This allows users to submit or update consents and
allows applications, with verified qualifications, to access only the
consented information for their use case.
Enforcement by customer middleware . Applications that require the
verification of a user's identity and qualifications can use the
Consent Management API to determine whether access is allowed for a given request.
Enforcement by resource servers . Resource servers can use a user's
identity to retrieve qualifications from other applications, if necessary,
and then call the Consent Management API to determine access before fulfilling
requests.
Policy representation
Consent policies within the Consent Management API are composed of a set of resource
attribute values that define what data that policy applies to and an
authorization rule that defines the conditions under which that policy is valid.
When multiple values are specified for a single resource attribute, the policy
applies to data matching any of those values. When multiple resource
attributes appear in a policy, each of those resource attributes must match for
the policy to apply.
Authorization rules use a constrained variation
of the Common Expression Language (CEL) to flexibly describe the relationships
between request attributes values that permit access to the relevant data. For
more information on CEL, see
Common Expression Language .
Consent resources can contain multiple consent policies that could represent a
positive response to consent questions presented to a user. Consent policies
could also be used to represent entire consent forms or organizational
and administrative decisions.
The following diagram shows how policies are represented in the
Consent Management API:
This diagram shows how to construct simple consent policies using resource
and request attributes. More complex policies can be constructed by combining
two or more policies.
Consent records
The Consent Management API stores the following types of consent records:
Consent artifacts : store the documents that were accepted or signed by the
user. These records can contain PDFs or images of the screens shown to the
user during the consent process. They can also be used to store signatures,
timestamps, and other important information that document the consent
process.
Consent resources : describe the consent that was given by the user in
terms of the configured consent attributes. The Consent Management API evaluates
these records to determine whether data is consented for a use case. Consent
resources contain the granted consent and the consent status. These records
can also be linked to the corresponding consent artifacts.
For more information on consent records, see
Creating and updating user consents .
Data management
The Consent Management API can manage data stored in your own schemas on Google Cloud,
on-premises, or with another cloud provider as long as the data can be described
using a string. The Consent Management API uses user data mappings to track the
managed data without that data needing to be stored within the service itself.
Each user data mapping contains a data ID, a user ID, and a set of resource
attribute values. The data ID is a string that uniquely identifies the data
represented by the user data mapping. The user ID is an opaque identifier that
links that data to a user. The resource attribute values describe the
characteristics of the data using a vocabulary defined by the attribute
definition resources.
The following are common storage locations for consent-managed data:
FHIR stores
BigQuery
Cloud Storage
For more information on creating user data mappings, see
Registering user data .
Access determination
Access determination requests are made by applications that need to know if the
proposed use is permitted to access a specific data element, all data elements
associated with a user, or whole data stores. The Consent Management API determines
if a request is permitted by evaluating whether or not there is a valid consent
that grants permission for the specified data and proposed use. The
Consent Management API performs this evaluation as follows:
The Consent Management API receives an access determination request with request
attribute values for the proposed use and either a target resource or a
range of target resources described by user IDs or resource attribute
values.
If a range of target resources is specified, the Consent Management API
determines the resources that match the range. For example, if you define a
range of resource attribute values, all resources within this range are used
in the access determination request.
Consents for all matched resources are identified.
The proposed use is evaluated against the authorization rules of the
relevant consents.
If any of the authorization rules permit this combination of request
attribute values, a positive access determination is returned for each
resource evaluated.
By default, access determination is only made on active consents. Consents in
the draft state can be included in the access determination by specifying them
directly in the access determination request. Consents that are expired,
revoked, or in the rejected state are ignored in all access determination requests.
For more information on making access determination requests, see
Making access determinations .
