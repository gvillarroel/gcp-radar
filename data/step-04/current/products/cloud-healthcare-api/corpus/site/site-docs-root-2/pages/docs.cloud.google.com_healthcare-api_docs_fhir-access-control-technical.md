FHIR access data model and control system
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to use the Cloud Healthcare API FHIR access control
system to manage and secure your healthcare data. You can use FHIR access
control to define consent policies, control data access based on user roles
and context, and enforce these policies in a FHIR store.
Data model overview
The data model for access control is represented by Consent resources .
They define the rules that apply and which data the rules apply to.
FHIR Consent
The access rules are expressed through FHIR Consent resources. FHIR Consent is a
type of
FHIR Resource
that captures a healthcare consumer's choices. It permits or denies a set of
actors to perform actions affecting the consumer for a specific purpose
from a specified environment over a period of time. For example, a consumer
could be a healthcare patient, anyone acting on behalf of a healthcare patient,
or another individual who enters into a consent agreement.
The actions recorded in a FHIR Consent may be broad and deal with more than
just the consumer's electronic health record (EHR) data, however for the
purposes of consent within the Cloud Healthcare API, the focus is on actions
related to data access and the enforcement of those actions is limited
to reading FHIR data from a FHIR store.
A Consent resource has a
status
that indicates the current state of the consent. Although a FHIR store may
contain many consents in different states, the Cloud Healthcare API only
enforces consents that are in the active state. Consents in any other state
have no effect on enforcement. If a consent is given on behalf of a
patient, the consent is recorded as being granted by a performer .
Policy type
Cloud Healthcare API supports the following consent policy types:
Patient consent : is associated with a Patient using Consent.patient
( STU3 ,
R4 )
and binds as many data as defined by the patient compartment
( STU3 ,
R4 ).
Admin policy : is not associated with any Patient and must have an
extension URL https://g.co/fhir/medicalrecords/ConsentAdminPolicy . This
policy type could bind to a subset or all resources in the store specified
by the resource criteria . Admin policy sets the default
policy for all binding resources in the store.
Admin cascading policy : a type of Admin policy that requires the
extension URL https://g.co/fhir/medicalrecords/CascadingPolicy and
the Admin policy extension URL. You can bind this policy type to a compartment of
resources that match the resource criteria . Has the
following limitations:
Only supports Patient ( STU3 , R4 ) or Encounter ( STU3 , R4 ) as compartment base.
The FHIR store where the policy is enforced must have
disableReferentialIntegrity
set to false . Contact Cloud Support to use this feature for non-referential integrity FHIR store.
You can combine policy types at the same resource level to permit or deny access to a resource. If a patient's consent is missing, the Admin policy can approve access to a resource.
Consent directive
Consent directives are instructions that are encoded within a FHIR Consent that
permit or deny data access to an authorized entity such as a grantee or an
accessor . A single FHIR Consent may encode multiple consent directives. Each
directive provides the following:
Enforcement type: a permit or deny instruction.
Action: the permission(s) covered by this directive. Only
access
is supported to provide read-only access.
Accessor criteria : a set of attributes that identify
the API requester covered by the directive.
Resource criteria : a set of attributes that identify
the resources covered by the directive.
Accessor criteria
The Cloud Healthcare API supports three properties of an accessor for use
within a consent directive and to match against an accessor making a data access
request. There must be a case-sensitive exact match to have a directive enforced
on the accessor as part of access determination offered by the FHIR server.
These properties are encoded as follows:
Actor : represents an individual, group, or access role that identifies
the accessor or a characteristic of the accessor.
Purpose : represents the intent of use of the data.
Environment : represents an abstract identifier that describes the
environment or conditions under which the accessor is acting.
For example, an accessor may be represented by the following properties:
Actor: Practitioner/123
Purpose:
ETREAT
or access for emergency treatment purposes
Environment: Application/abc
In this example, these properties represent a doctor who is accessing data when
performing emergency treatment using a software application called abc .
provision.actor
and
provision.purpose
are defined as part of the FHIR standard, whereas Environment is
https://g.co/fhir/medicalrecords/Environment . Note that this link is not
resolvable.
All consent directives must specify an actor to be enforced but need not
always specify a purpose or an environment . For example, if no environment
is specified in the consent directive, then the directive matches any
environment that is not already covered by other consent directives.
Resource criteria
The Cloud Healthcare API supports the following elements as part of the
consent resource:
Resource type
( STU3 ,
R4 ): represents
the type that the consent policy binds to, for example, Encounter ,
Observation , or Immunization .
Resource ID
( STU3 ,
R4 ):
represents the ID that the consent policy binds to.
Data source : represents the origin of the resource as identified by the
resource
meta.source
(only available in R4).
Data tag : represents the custom label of the resource as described in
the resource meta.tag
( STU3 ,
R4 ).
Security label : represents security labels that define affected resources
as identified in the meta.security field
( STU3 ,
R4 ).
The following code systems are supported:
Confidentiality :
hierarchical values ranked from unrestricted to most restricted:
U , L , M , N , R , V . If a consent permits a security label of R
then it applies to all resources that are labeled R or lower. If a
consent denies a security label R then it applies to all resources that
are at least as sensitive as R .
ActCode :
exact string matching on security code.
Note: Examples of how different policies can be represented through Consent resource can be found in How-To Docs .
Access workflow
This figure illustrates the end-to-end journey of a request to a FHIR access control enabled store. An external token with the consent scope (left) is used by application (#3) when making a request to the FHIR store with access control enabled (right).
Consent scope
When making a data access request, an accessor operates within a particular
Consent Scope that represents their actor , purpose , and environment
properties related to any FHIR HTTP request. The values for these properties
must be a case-sensitive match with those provided within a consent for them to
affect the enforcement's access determination.
An accessor can have multiple actor identifiers that are relevant for making
an access determination. Likewise, there can be multiple purposes or
environments that are relevant within a particular consent context. Therefore,
all relevant accessor properties should be provided as part of a FHIR HTTP
request to properly represent that accessor for consent purposes.
For example, the consent scope for a given data request may be the following:
actor/Practitioner/444 actor/Group/999 purp/v3/TREAT purp/v3/ETREAT env/App/abc
This represents a nurse or a doctor known as practitioner 444 who is a member
of group 999 which represents practitioners from a department within a
specific hospital. The practitioner is there to provide regular treatment, but
possibly also deal with emergency treatment as part of these actions. The
practitioner is using a software application called abc .
The consent scope is provided as a Request consent scope as
part of an accessor's data request.
Request consent scope
FHIR requests use FHIR HTTP request headers to receive the accessor's consent
scope. This consent scope contains a set of actor , purpose , and
environment values to reflect the accessor's current identity, qualifications,
intent of use, and environmental constraints in which the accessor operates.
There may be more than one of each of these properties that represent an
accessor's consent scope at any one time.
Consent consent scope entries are defined as follows:
actor/{type}/{ID} : an actor property where the resource type is
provided along with the ID . Examples of type include the following:
Practitioner
Group
Patient
For example, if a store of the format projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us-central1/datasets/ DATASET_ID /fhirStores/ STORE_ID calls the API, a local reference to a Practitioner/123 actor resolves to projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/us-central1/datasets/ DATASET_ID /fhirStores/ STORE_ID /fhir/Practitioner/123 .
purp/v3/{value} : a purpose property where value is a member of the
FHIR Purpose of Use ( v3 )
value set or its extension. Examples of value include:
TREAT
ETREAT
HRESCH
env/{type}/{value} : an environment property where type and value are
custom strings with no predefined taxonomy. Examples of type and value
include:
App/my_app_1
Net/VPN
In addition, FHIR HTTP request headers can also receive special scopes, such as
btg
and bypass which are defined as follows:
btg : Break the glass (or BTG) lets you, as a human user, skip consent
checks in case of emergencies. It should be used in emergencies only and is
subject to post-audit review. As a result, btg requires at least one
actor .
bypass : Allows trusted users (such as an administrator) or trusted
applications (such as a ML-training pipeline) to operate on the FHIR store
without consent authorization. Hence, bypass requires at least one actor
and one env .
Note: Requests using btg or bypass are annotated differently in the
consentMode of the audit logs . To facilitate data governance
checks, these two special privileges should only be used for their intended
purposes.
Access enforcement and access determination
In a complex healthcare environment where multiple policies and consents
coexist, enforcing access and determining access permissions can be a daunting
task. Various stakeholders may have different expectations and requirements
regarding the use and disclosure of patient information. Navigating this
intricate landscape necessitates a clear understanding of how access is enforced
and the underlying logic that governs access determination.
Aggregated consent policy
A healthcare consumer, such as a patient or an administrator, may have multiple
consent directives contained within a single Consent resource. Consent resources
may contain a mix of permit and deny
provision.type
directives. By default, a user may have any number of Consent resources but up
to 200 active
Consent resources are enforced at a time. See
Constraints and limitations for more details.
All the consent directives are extracted from active Consent resources for a
given user to make a set of aggregated consent rules.
Consent directive properties
Consent enforcement is limited to at most one
purpose
and at most one environment per
provision
entry.
The following rules describe the principles for the joint access control of
patient consent, admin policy and admin cascading policy:
All resources are denied access by default if there is no matching directive.
If the requested resource does not exist, only resource type and resource ID
are identifiable. All other resource criteria and the resource owner are
unknown, the following rule applies in the listing order:
If the resource type belongs to the patient-compartment or
encounter-compartment: the access is denied.
Otherwise:
If there is an admin policy denying the accessor criteria regardless
of the other resource criteria, the access is denied.
If there is an admin policy permitting the accessor criteria for the
identifiable resource criteria (i.e. resource type and resource id), a
"resource not found" error is returned.
All other cases, the access is denied.
Admin policies are the default policies used for matching resources in the store.
Resources that don't belong to any patient are determined by only the admin
policies.
Resources that are in the patient compartment
( STU3 , R4 ) or encounter compartment
( STU3 ,
R4 ) need at least one permit consent directive per patient or
admin policy or admin cascading policy and no deny consent directive
from patient and admin policy and admin cascading policy. This
condition is needed from all the patients named on the resources to be
accessed by the requestor.
Some resources may support multiple patient participants. For example,
Appointment provides a list of
participants which may be patients. All patients named on such
resources must permit access to the accessor using consent directives,
otherwise the resources aren't returned. If a resource has a permission
from an encounter cascading policy, where this encounter references a
patient through the subject field
( STU3 ,
R4 ), then the resource is considered to be permitted by the
patient.
The described rules are summarized by the following pseudo-code:
Joint access control
if resource does not exist
if resource is a patient-compartment or encounter-compartment resource:
return "deny"
else:
if there is any admin policy denies access for accessor criteria regardless of resource criteria other than resource type and resource ID:
return "deny"
else if there is any admin policy permits access for accessor criteria based on the identifiable resource criteria :
return "resource not found"
else:
return "deny"
else:
let patients = list of patient references named in the patient compartment eligible fields of the requested resource
if there is any matching deny from either patients 's consents or admin policy or admin cascading policy:
return "deny"
if there is matching admin policy permits access:
return "permit"
if all patients have matching patient consents or admin cascading consent that permit access or are subject of encounters which permit the access through encounter cascading policy:
return "permit"
else:
return "deny"
end
The FHIR store checks consent permission at the per resource level. Any
reference
in a resource is not resolved and cascaded for consent access check purposes.
For example, consider a patient identified by Patient/f001 that allows a
Practitioner to access their entire MedicationRequest resource, but not the
Patient/f001 resource itself due to the patient privacy. In this scenario, the
Practitioner can see the entire MedicationRequest resource which includes a
subject field referring to the Patient/f001 resource, but cannot see the
contents of the Patient/f001 resource even, for example, when performing
a FHIR search using _include .
Conflict resolution
Conflicts are possible between various permit and deny directives. If two
conflicting directives match a resource, the conflict is resolved using the
deny wins over permit model.
Only active consents are included for consent enforcement.
Resource access enforcement logic
When making a consent-aware request to a FHIR store, access control occurs in
the following order:
The Cloud Healthcare API checks the permissions on the Google Cloud
service account (or the principal) configured in the proxy. If the service
account has the correct IAM permissions to perform the requested FHIR method
on the FHIR store, the request proceeds.
If consent enforcement is enabled in the
FHIR store configuration and the
consent-aware HTTP headers are present, then the Cloud Healthcare API enforces consent access policies for Patient
Compartment resources. The enforcement of consent access policies is based
on the consent scopes provided in the request, according to the consent
directives captured by the most recent execution of ApplyConsents and
ApplyAdminConsents .
Note: If the FHIR store configuration defines the
consent header handling as REQUIRED_ON_READ , consent access control
is enforced (and rejected) even without the consent aware headers.
The following rules apply when making a consent-aware request to a FHIR store:
Provide at least one actor consent scope relevant for the consenting
actions taken.
Provide any additional purpose and environment scopes relevant for the
consenting actions taken.
If the number of consent scope entries exceeds the
supported limits , an error is returned.
If you call a method that accesses multiple resources (for example, the
fhir.Patient-everything ,
fhir.Encounter-everything ,
fhir.executeBundle ,
or
fhir.search
method), consent enforcement applies to each individual resource. However,
there is a subtle difference between these multi-resource access methods:
fhir.executeBundle reading multiple resources receives "Consent access
denied or the resource being accessed does not exist" for individual
resource without consent permissions (see examples in the
Get FHIR resources with consent scope ).
fhir.search skips resources without consent permissions and
does not return consent access denied error, even for searching by _id
(see examples in the
Search FHIR resources with consent scope ).
fhir.Patient-everything and fhir.Encounter-everything behave similarly
to fhir.search , except that they return "Consent access denied or the
resource being accessed does not exist" if the caller does not have consent
permission on the requested Patient or Encounter resource, respectively.
Consent access determination
A consent directive has at most one actor , at most one purpose , and at most
one environment whereas consent scope may have multiple of each. Some consent
directives don't specify all three accessor properties, in which case any
consent scope property value may match depending on
conflict resolution rules. As result, a consent scope
may match more than one consent directive.
If the consent scope of a request includes two or more entries of the same
consent scope type ( actor , purpose , or environment ), then the consent
scope possibly matches multiple consent directives. Some consent directives don't specify a purpose or an environment . Therefore the consent scope must be
also matched against consent directives that don't specify these scope types.
For example, setting the consent scope to actor/Practitioner/123
actor/Group/999 purp/v3/TREAT env/App/abc matches against any of the following
permit or deny consent directives:
actor/Practitioner/123 purp/v3/TREAT env/App/abc
actor/Practitioner/123 purp/v3/TREAT
actor/Practitioner/123 env/App/abc
actor/Practitioner/123
actor/Group/999 purp/v3/TREAT env/App/abc
actor/Group/999 purp/v3/TREAT
actor/Group/999 env/App/abc
actor/Group/999
