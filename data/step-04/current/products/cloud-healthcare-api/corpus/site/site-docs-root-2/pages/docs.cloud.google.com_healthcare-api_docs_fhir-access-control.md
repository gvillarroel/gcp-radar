Access control in FHIR
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
FHIR access control is a comprehensive solution for managing access to
healthcare data in FHIR stores. It provides a granular level of control over
which users can access which resources, and what actions they can take on those
resources. FHIR access control helps to ensure that healthcare data is only
accessed by authorized users, and that it is used in a way that is consistent
with the intent of the data owner.
FHIR access control is built on the following principles:
Granularity : provides a fine-grained level of control over access to
data. This allows organizations to define access policies that are tailored
to their specific needs.
Flexibility : adapts to meet the changing needs of organizations. This
allows organizations to keep their access control policies up-to-date as
their data governance requirements evolve.
Scalability : provides an integrated and streamlined approach to managing
end-user consents. This provides built-in access enforcement for each EHR
operation with minimal overhead.
Compliance : conforms to the FHIR specification. This ensures that
organizations can use FHIR access control with any FHIR-compliant system.
FHIR access control addresses a wide range of data governance challenges, such
as the following:
Patient consent : enforces patient consent to use their healthcare data.
This ensures that patients are in control of how their data is used.
Data sharing : facilitates healthcare data sharing between organizations.
This improves the coordination of care and supports research.
Regulatory compliance : helps organizations comply with regulatory
requirements for the protection of healthcare data.
FHIR access control offers a number of benefits, including the following:
Improved data security : improves the security of healthcare data by
ensuring that only authorized users can access data.
Reduced risk of data breaches : reduces the risk of data breaches by
providing a centralized mechanism for data access management.
Improved compliance : helps organizations to comply with regulatory
requirements for the protection of healthcare data.
Increased patient trust : ensures patient trust by giving patients
control over how their data is used.
Authorities of consent
The following four main authorities are involved in consent:
Administrator authority : establishes the framework for consent
authority. They determine who can grant consent, what information must be
included in a consent agreement, and how consent agreements will be
enforced.
Grantor authority : an individual or organization that grants consent to
access data, such as a patient or an administrator. They can provide consent
agreements to grantees or delegate consent authority to others.
System authority : the ability to make authoritative assertions about the
identity, application use case, and environment of a grantee. This can be
used in a zero-trust
architecture
to verify that a grantee has the right to access data.
Grantee authority : an individual or organization that is granted consent
to access data, such as the EHR's accessor. They can provide information
about their role, purpose, and environment to help the system verify their
identity and authority.
The distribution of authority, the rules that govern them, and the evaluation of
data elements as part of matching policies with accessors are unique to consent
when compared to other forms of access control.
Comparison with other access control systems
FHIR access control allows fine grained resource level access control, whereas
Identity and Access Management (IAM) focuses on project, dataset and fhir store level
permissions.
SMART-on-FHIR
focuses on the use case of single authority with basic policies and request
attributes. While SMART-on-FHIR provides some level of granularity, it's limited
by single request attributes and cannot allow same level of fine-grained control
as FHIR access control. Full comparisons are listed in the following table.

Multi-authority enablement : enable both administrators and patients,
within their boundary, to grant consents / enforce policies.
Multi-request attributes : represent grantee as a set of abstract actor,
purpose, and environment attributes for evaluation against consent policies.
Dynamic fine-grained resource attributes : allow applying policy
enforcement / granting consent to various data elements (e.g. resource type,
data source, data tag). Access can change in real time with data mutation.
Comprehensive overlapping policies : multiple consents can be enforced on
a single resource with comprehensive access determination rules.
Performance & Scalability : all EHR's operations (e.g.
patient-$everything, search) are performant with minimal overhead.
In-built EHR security : all EHR's operations are supported without the
need for additional configuration or customization.
Concurrent permission change : when there is a permission change,
existing issued credentials (e.g. access tokens) are subjected to the new
permission.
Policy administration and audit : allow administrators to draft and
update policies with audit trail and audit data accesses (e.g. who attempted
to access what data for which purpose in which environment).
