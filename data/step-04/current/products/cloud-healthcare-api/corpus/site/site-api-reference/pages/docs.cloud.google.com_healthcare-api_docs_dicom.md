DICOM conformance statement
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
DICOM stores within the Cloud Healthcare API support a subset of the RESTful web
services specified in the DICOM PS3.18 - Web Services
standard (commonly referred to as DICOMweb). Specifically, they support the
Studies Service and Resources
(previously referred to as the WADO-RS, STOW-RS, and QIDO-RS services).
Additionally, the Cloud Healthcare API supports a proprietary web service for
deleting DICOM instances.
The Cloud Healthcare API does not support the URI Service ,
the Worklist Service ,
the Non-Patient Instance Service
or any of the Capabilities Transactions .
Note: Interested in DIMSE
DICOM protocols? We have open sourced several adapters to allow ingestion and
retrieval of DICOM data using protocols such as C-Store on
GitHub .
Retrieve transaction
The Retrieve Transaction
is a RESTful web service for retrieving DICOM imaging data.
The Retrieve Transaction supports the retrieving following resources:
DICOM Resources:
Study
Series
Instance
Frames
Bulkdata
Metadata Resources
Study
Series
Instance
Rendered Resources
Instance
Frames
It does not support Thumbnail resources.
See Quotas and limits for details on quotas and limits for these
methods.

Warning: The response's default transfer syntax is Little Endian Explicit. As a
result, if the file was uploaded using a compressed transfer syntax, the
returned object will be decompressed. This can negatively impact performance and
lead to errors for transfer syntaxes that the Cloud Healthcare API doesn't
support . To avoid these issues, and if the
returned object's transfer syntax doesn't matter to your application, use the
multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=* Accept Header.
DICOM instances
In addition to the above Accept Headers, RetrieveInstance supports single part
content types for convenience:
application/dicom; transfer-syntax=*

DICOM frames
The following Accept Headers are supported:
multipart/related; type="application/octet-stream"; transfer-syntax=*
multipart/related; type="application/octet-stream"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 (default)
multipart/related; type="image/jpeg"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.50

multipart/related; type="application/x-deflate"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.8.1
A transfer syntax of * allows the user to request no transcoding be done, so
the transfer syntax of the uploaded file will be used. For application/octet-stream
the bulk data will be returned in whatever format it appears in the uploaded DICOM
file.
Rendered resources
The following Accept Headers are supported:
image/jpeg (default)
image/png
Only retrieving of Instance or Frame resources is supported.
No URL parameters are supported other than Viewport .
Metadata resources
The following Accept Headers are supported:
application/dicom+json (default)
multipart/related; type=application/dicom+xml
Tags that are encoded as InlineBinary elements will be encoded using
little-endian byte ordering, as the
transfer syntax parameter
is not supported on endpoints requesting metadata resources.
RetrieveMetadata will include BulkDataURIs for tags matching
the
Bulkdata definition .
DICOM sequence tags containing more than approximately 1 MiB of data will not
be returned in metadata resources. This limitation applies to metadata resources
only. DICOM resources will still contain these tags.
Bulkdata resources
The following Accept Headers are supported:
multipart/related; type="application/octet-stream"; transfer-syntax=* (default)
application/octet-stream; transfer-syntax=*
Supported transfer syntaxes for transcoding
The above Accept headers describe what media types & transfer syntaxes you can
request from the API, but this may not always be possible depending on the transfer syntax
of the original file that was uploaded. In particular, transcoding is only possible
from the following transfer syntaxes:
1.2.840.10008.1.2 (Little Endian Implicit)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 (Little Endian Explicit)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.2 (Explicit VR Big Endian)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.1.99 (Deflated Explicit VR Little Endian)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.50 (JPEG Baseline Process 1)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.51 (JPEG Extended)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.57 (JPEG Lossless)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70 (JPEG Lossless Selection Value 1)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.80 (JPEG-LS Lossless)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.81 (JPEG-LS Near-Lossless)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90 (JPEG 2000 Lossless Only)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.91 (JPEG 2000)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.110 (JPEG XL Lossless)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.111 (JPEG XL JPEG Recompression)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.112 (JPEG XL)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.201 (HTJ2K Lossless Only)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.202 (HTJ2K Lossless Only with RPCL Options)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.203 (HTJ2K)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.5 (RLE Lossless)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.8.1 (Deflated Image Frame Compression)
If the original file has a transfer syntax other than that in the above list and you
request transcoding to another format, an error will be returned.
The Cloud Healthcare API cannot transcode non-monochrome images with bit depth greater
than 8 to JPEG. Also, images with a Bits Allocated (0028, 0100) value of 1 or that
are stored in either Float Pixel Data (7FE0,0008), Double Float Pixel Data (7FE0,0009)
tags can only be transcoded between native formats.
In order to disable transcoding and retrieve any file from the API you can set
transfer-syntax=* in your Accept header.

Store transaction
The Store Transaction
is a RESTful web service for storing DICOM imaging data.
The store transaction either accepts Part 10 DICOM binary files directly or it
accepts splitting of a DICOM file into metadata (represented in JSON) and bulk data.
These 2 versions have different semantics that are described in the following
sections.
See Quotas and limits for details on quotas and limits for this
method.
DICOM part 10 binary files
The following Content-Types are supported:
multipart/related; type=application/dicom
application/dicom
No coercing or replacing of attributes is done by the server.
This version accepts all transfer-syntaxes and SOP classes. Only minimal validation
of the DICOM file is done to extract some key metadata attributes.
Note that for convenience, the Store Transaction also accepts a single part HTTP request
with a single DICOM instance with content type application/dicom . This is not
part of the official DICOMweb standard.
See Store a DICOM instance
for the associated how-to guide.
JSON metadata and bulk data requests
When storing instances using JSON metadata and bulk data, the first multipart part must consist of a JSON array of DICOM instances .
The first part must have a Content-Type of application/dicom+json; transfer-syntax= TransferSyntaxUID
where TransferSyntaxUID is the transfer syntax which was used to encode binary data in InlineBinary objects.
If no InlineBinary objects are present in the metadata, the transfer-syntax parameter can be omitted.
The following DICOM elements are required to be present in every instance in the JSON metadata:
SpecificCharacterSet
TransferSyntaxUID
SOPClassUID
StudyInstanceUID
SeriesInstanceUID
SOPInstanceUID
The SpecificCharacterSet element must be set to ISO_IR 192 , and the JSON
metadata must be encoded in unicode UTF-8. The TransferSyntaxUID can be set to
any valid transfer syntax, except for the following unsupported transfer
syntaxes:
1.2.840.10008.1.2.2 (Explicit VR Big Endian)
1.2.840.10008.1.2.1.99 (Deflated Explicit VR Little Endian)
Within the JSON metadata, the user can specify multiple BulkDataURIs for DICOM tags with VRs of OB, OW, or UN.
These BulkDataURIs indicate that the binary data for the tag which contains the URI will be sent in a following part which has the Content-Location header set to the BulkDataURI.
Each instance in the JSON metadata can have at most one BulkDataURI. There must not be any duplicate BulkDataURIs in the JSON metadata. Compressed image bulk data must only be sent for the PixelData tag, and when sent, the transfer syntax specified in the bulk data part must match the value of the instance's TransferSyntaxUID element.
The following Content-Types are supported for bulk data parts:
application/octet-stream
image/jpeg; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70
image/jpeg; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.50
image/jpeg; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.​4.​51
image/jpeg; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.​4.​57
image/dicom-rle; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.5
image/jls; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.​4.​80
image/jls; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.81
image/jp2; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90
image/jp2; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.91
image/jpx; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.92
image/jpx; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.93
An alternative method to specify binary data is to encode it as an InlineBinary base64 encoded string.
This is supported for all tags except PixelData, which must be sent as a bulk data part.
When InlineBinary objects are used in the JSON metadata, the transfer syntax which was used for encoding must be specified in the Content-Type of the JSON metadata part.
The server doesn't derive image pixel description macro attributes .
See Create DICOM instances from JSON metadata and JPEG files
for the associated how-to guide.
Response
On an error, either an additional FailureDetail (0009, 0097) tag (for XML responses) or FailureDetailJSON (0009,1097) tag (for JSON responses) will be returned. The FailureDetail tag provides a human-readable description of the error.
If a DICOM instance has the same <StudyInstanceUID, SeriesInstanceUID, SOPInstanceUID>
tuple as another instance already in the DICOM store, a Processing failure error
is returned with an "already exists" FailureDetail tag.
The response can be in either JSON or XML format which can be controlled via the
following Accept header values:
application/dicom+xml (default)
application/dicom+json
Status codes
Code
Meaning
200 (OK)
The resource was successfully stored.
400 (Bad Request)
The request was invalid (e.g. unsupported media type or transfer syntax).
401 (Unauthorized)
The request is missing authentication credentials.
403 (Permission Denied)
The authenticated user doesn't have access to this resource (or the resource doesn't exist).
406 (Not Acceptable)
The server doesn't support any of the Acceptable Media Types.
409 (Conflict)
At least one resource wasn't successfully stored (e.g. invalid DICOM file). Check the FailureDetail tag in the response body for more information.
429 (Too Many Requests)
The client is exceeding its quota .
503 (Service Unavailable)
The server is currently unavailable or the request exceeded its deadline.
Search transaction
The Search Transaction
is a RESTful web service for querying DICOM imaging metadata.
The Cloud Healthcare API supports searching for studies, series and instances.
Search parameters
Searching by the following tags is supported:
Studies:
StudyInstanceUID
PatientName
PatientID
AccessionNumber
ReferringPhysicianName
StudyDate
Series: all study level search terms and
SeriesInstanceUID
Modality
Instances: all study/series level search terms and
SOPInstanceUID
Only single value, exact matching is supported, except for StudyDate which
supports range queries and PatientName which supports fuzzy matching.
Warning: Part 6 of the DICOM standard
specifies that the tags in the preceding list must have a VM of 1 and the
specified VR. While the Cloud Healthcare API doesn't block ingestion of non-conformant
instances (VM
greater than 1 or incorrect VR for the preceding tags), they may not be searchable.
The following additional URL parameters are supported:
fuzzymatching : If set to true , fuzzy matching will be applied to the
PatientName tag. Fuzzy matching will perform tokenization and normalization
of both the value of PatientName in the query and the stored value. It will
match if any search token is a prefix of any stored token. For example, if
PatientName is "John^Doe", then "jo", "Do" and "John Doe" will all match.
However "ohn" will not match.
includefield : Can be set to a comma-separated list of attributeIDs, such as
DICOM tag IDs or keywords, or set to the value all to return all available
tags. For a list of available tags, see Returned results .
Paging is supported using the limit and offset query parameters. There is
no Warning response header if no more results are available. You must execute
an extra query to determine if there are more results.
limit : Maximum number of results that should be returned, up to a maximum
of 5,000 for studies/series and 50,000 for instances. The default number of
results is 100 for studies/series and 1,000 for instances.
offset : Number of results to skip in the beginning up to a maximum of
1,000,000.
Timezone Offset From UTC is not supported.
Returned results
The response can be in either JSON or XML format which can be controlled using
the following Accept header values:
application/dicom+json (default)
multipart/related; type=application/dicom+xml
By default the following attributes will be returned:
Studies:
SpecificCharacterSet
StudyDate

Instances: all attributes present in the DICOM instance, excluding the
following exceptions.
DICOM sequence tags containing more than approximately 1 MiB of data will not
be returned in the metadata response.
Inconsistent/invalid metadata
In the case of SearchForStudies/SearchForSeries there is a potential for
inconsistent study/series level metadata across multiple instances. For example,
two instances could be uploaded with the same StudyInstanceUID but have
different StudyDates. In this case, the search behavior is not well defined.
Searching by that value may work in some cases, but not others and the returned
value may vary across different calls.

503 (Service Unavailable)
The server is currently unavailable or the request exceeded its deadline.
Deletion
The Cloud Healthcare API supports the following proprietary action types:
DeleteStudy
DeleteSeries
DeleteInstance
These use the same request paths as their WADO-RS counterparts (RetrieveStudy, RetrieveSeries, and RetrieveInstance, respectively). Instead of an HTTP GET request, a DELETE request is used. The effect is that the specified study, series, or instance is deleted along with all the DICOM resources contained in it.
The DeleteStudy
and DeleteSeries methods return a long running operation
which deletes all of the instances in the study or series. Please note that instances cannot be inserted into a study or series that is being deleted by an operation until the operation completes.
See Managing long-running operations
for a how-to guide on operations.
A successful DeleteInstance
request returns an empty response.
Warning: Study and series search results can take a few seconds to be updated after an instance is deleted using DeleteInstance.
Status codes
Code

429 (Too Many Requests)
The client is exceeding its quota .
503 (Service Unavailable)
The server is currently unavailable or the request exceeded its deadline.
Accept headers
Some of the above methods provide the ability to control the response format
using HTTP Accept headers. Wildcard matching is supported at both the top level
(e.g. */* ) and subtype (e.g. image/* ). Specifying a q value is also
supported to indicate relative preference. If a q value is not specified for
an Accept header, it is set to the default value of 1.0.
In the event that multiple Accept headers are specified and there is a tie
between the highest preference Accept headers, the server will choose the Accept
header. Clients should not depend on the server's choice of Accept header in
this scenario.
Supported SOP classes
The Cloud Healthcare API can ingest and do basic retrieval of all DICOM
SOP classes. For any retrieval that requires transcoding between image formats,
see supported transfer syntaxes for transcoding for a list of
supported transfer syntaxes.
DICOM Dictionary Version
The Cloud Healthcare API uses the DICOM 2025b dictionary
for parsing tags of ingested instances and for generating column names when
exporting to BigQuery.
Bulkdata Definition
When retrieving metadata, the Cloud Healthcare API will exclude certain tags that
are defined as bulkdata. Instead, these tags will be returned alongside metadata
with a BulkDataURI that allows the user to retrieve contents of these tags (see
RetrieveBulkdata ).
The following is the definition used by the Cloud Healthcare API:
Any Pixel Data tag: (7FE0,0008), (7FE0,0009) (7FE0,0010).
Any tag with a VR of OB, OW, or UN.
A tag with a VR of OD, OF, OL, or OV that is larger than 2 KiB.
For legacy reasons, tags of instances already ingested into the
Cloud Healthcare API might be considered bulkdata if the tag is larger
than 256 B (OF and OL) or 512 B (OD).
A tag with a VR of AT, FD, FL, UL, US, SV, or UV and has a Value
Multiplicity (VM) greater than 512.
For legacy reasons, tags of instances already ingested into the
