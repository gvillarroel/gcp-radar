Overview of the Cloud Healthcare API
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Cloud Healthcare API provides industry-standard protocols and formats
for ingesting, storing, analyzing, and integrating healthcare data with
cloud-based applications. The API supports the following applications:
Healthcare machine learning applications
Data-level integration of healthcare systems
Secure storage and retrieval of healthcare and life science data, including
electronic protected health information (ePHI) and other forms of PII
For many applications, the Cloud Healthcare API can provide a cloud-based
alternative to on-premises stacks implementing the following standards:
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) DSTU2, STU3, and R4 standards
Health Level Seven Version 2.x (HL7v2)
The Cloud Healthcare API simplifies data integration with existing
systems and allows developers to focus on
differentiating features, such as UX and intelligence.
Data model
The API consists of three modalities that implement individual industry-wide
standards:
Medical imaging data in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format
Clinical event messages in the Health Level Seven Version 2.x (HL7v2) format
Clinical resources in the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format
Each modality has different structural and processing characteristics, but
they are all backed by a standards-compliant data store that provides read,
write, search, and other operations on the data.
The data stores corresponding to each modality reside in datasets, which are
containers in your Google Cloud (Google Cloud) project that hold
modality-specific healthcare data.
For more information, see Projects, datasets, and data stores .
Features of the Cloud Healthcare API
This section describes the features that make up the Cloud Healthcare API and the
primary purpose of each feature.
Standards conformance
The Cloud Healthcare API implements a REST API for multiple healthcare
modalities. For example:
The FHIR portion of the REST API conforms to the DSTU2, STU3, and R4 FHIR
specifications.
The DICOM portion of the REST API conforms to DICOMweb, a web-based standard for exchanging medical images.
Compliance with privacy regulations
The Cloud Healthcare API is covered by Google Cloud's security,
privacy, and compliance assessments/certifications for industry standards,
such as:
ISO 27001
ISO 27017
ISO 27018
PCI DSS
The Cloud Healthcare API is a covered service under the
Google Cloud HIPAA BAA, which means that customers can use it
with electronic protected health information (ePHI), with
appropriate configuration. The Cloud Healthcare API has been developed
according to Google's security and
privacy practices.
Google Cloud provides detailed guidance regarding compliance with HIPAA in the US,
the PIPEDA in Canada, and other global privacy standards .
Data location control
Data location is a core component of the API. You can select the storage
location for each dataset from a list of currently available locations that
correspond to distinct geographic areas aligned with Google Cloud's
regional structure. Data stores exist in the same region as their parent dataset.
For more information, see Regions .
Security
The Cloud Healthcare API security model is based on Google's Identity and
Access Management (IAM) system. IAM's fine-grained permissions give you
complete control over what can be done with healthcare data, and by whom.
To provide comprehensive threat detection and traffic management capabilities,
there are also implementations of open source proxies for the Apigee
API Management system . You can use these implementations
to securely expose sensitive ePHI with patient and provider applications.
Bulk import and export
The Cloud Healthcare API's DICOM and FHIR modalities support bulk import and export
of data, making it easier to transfer data to and from Cloud Storage .
You can also export FHIR resources and DICOM store metadata to BigQuery .
BigQuery lets you perform advanced data discovery and
analytics workloads on large datasets.
For more information, see Importing and exporting DICOM data
and Exporting DICOM metadata .
Data de-identification
The Cloud Healthcare API supports de-identifying data at the dataset,
FHIR store, and DICOM store level.
De-identification using the Cloud Healthcare API simplifies the process
of redacting sensitive information for research and
other purposes. For more information, see
Data de-identification .
Auditability
You can use Cloud Logging to audit administrative and data
access requests.
For more information, see Access control
and Viewing Cloud Audit Logs .
High performance
Using Google Cloud's high-performance technology, the Cloud Healthcare API can scale to
thousands of requests per second, even when accessing large volumes
of data.
High availability
Availability for mission-critical scenarios is made possible through Google Cloud's
robust and highly redundant infrastructure.
Durability
Cloud Healthcare API is designed for 99.999999999% annual durability.
Durability is
achieved by storing data across multiple disks located in different power and
network failure domains.
