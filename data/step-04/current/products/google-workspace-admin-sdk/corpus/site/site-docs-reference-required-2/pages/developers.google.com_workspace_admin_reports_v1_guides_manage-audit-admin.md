Admin Activity Report
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The admin activity report returns information on the
Admin console activities of all of your account's administrators.
Each report uses the basic report endpoint request with report-specific
parameters such as an administrator's name or a specific
Admin console event. The maximum time period for each report is
the last 180 days.
The admin activity report may be used only for lawful purposes in
accordance with your Customer Agreement. And these reports apply to
Google Workspace, Education, and ISP accounts.

use the following GET HTTP request and include the authorization

GET https://admin.googleapis.com/admin/reports/v1/activity/users/ all
/applications/ admin ?endTime= a date &startTime= a date
