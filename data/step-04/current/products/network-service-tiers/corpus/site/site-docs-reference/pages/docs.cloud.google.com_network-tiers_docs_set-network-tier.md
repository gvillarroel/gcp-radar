Set the network tier
This page shows you how to specify a network tier for your workloads.
Before manually setting a network tier, review the information in the
Network Service Tiers overview .
Specifications
Network Service Tiers is only supported by
eligible Google Cloud resources .
Standard Tier and Premium Tier are
available in every Google Cloud region.
External IP address pools
Whether an external IP address is regional or global (and if regional, what its
network tier is) determines the pool from which the IP address is chosen. IP
addresses in one pool cannot be moved to another.
In Standard Tier, the pool of regional external IP addresses is unique to its
respective region, not to the type of eligible resource. For example, virtual
machine (VM) instances and Google Cloud load balancers that use Standard
Tier (external Application Load Balancers, external proxy Network Load Balancers, and
external passthrough Network Load Balancers) all use IP addresses from the chosen region's Standard
Tier pool.
In Premium Tier, external Application Load Balancers and external proxy Network Load Balancers use
global external IP addresses, while external passthrough Network Load Balancers and VM instances use
regional external IP addresses. In each region, the pool of regional
external IP addresses for Premium Tier is separate from the pool of global
external IP addresses.
Unassigned IP addresses
Unused regional external IP addresses in Standard Tier behave differently from
unused IP addresses in Premium Tier.
Standard Tier IP addresses are automatically parked when they are not assigned
to an eligible resource. When an IP address is parked, the load balancer answers
certain requests to that IP address; for example, HTTP requests sent to a
parked Standard Tier IP address are sent to a Google-hosted HTTP 404
(Not Found) web page. Traffic sent to parked Standard Tier IP addresses is not
simply dropped. In addition, Standard Tier IP addresses that are being
processed for assignment to a resource can behave as if they are parked.
A Standard Tier external IP address assigned to a VM instance might be moved to
a parked state during
live migration if the migration takes more
than 20 minutes.
A Premium Tier external IP address assigned to a VM drops
traffic during long live migrations.
Setting the default network tier for a project
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or the following IAM roles.
Permissions
projects.setDefaultNetworkTier , which requires
compute.projects.setDefaultNetworkTier on the project.
Roles
roles/compute.admin
Follow these directions to define a default network tier for your project. This
tier is used by newly created eligible resources in the project unless you
specify a tier for the resources themselves. Changing the default network tier
for a project does not change the tier for any existing resources, but it does
change the network tier for any new resource if you don't specify a network tier
when creating the new resource.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Network Service Tiers page.
Go to the Network Service Tiers page
Click Change tier .
Select Premium or Standard , and then click Change .
gcloud
gcloud compute project-info update \
--default-network-tier NETWORK_TIER
Replace NETWORK_TIER with PREMIUM or STANDARD .
The default is PREMIUM .
API
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /setNetworkTier
{
"networkTier": "STANDARD"
}
Replace PROJECT_ID with your project ID.
Terraform
You can use a
Terraform resource
to set the network tier for a project. This example sets the tier
to STANDARD .
resource "google_compute_project_default_network_tier" "project-tier" {
project = var.project_id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes
network_tier = "STANDARD"
}
The network tier that you specify for a resource always takes precedence over
the default network tier that you define for your project. For example, if your
project's default network tier is Premium, you can still create an instance or
a load balancer in Standard Tier.
Tier configuration level (click to enlarge).
Creating static external IP addresses
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or the following IAM roles.
Permissions
compute.addresses.insert , which requires
compute.addresses.create on the project and
compute.subnetworks.use on the subnetwork.
Roles
roles/compute.networkAdmin
When creating a static regional external IP address, you can specify either
PREMIUM or STANDARD for its network tier. If you don't specify a network
tier, the address is created using the
project default tier .
Note: Global external IP addresses and internal IP addresses are always Premium
Tier.
To reserve a static regional external IP address that uses Standard Tier, do the
following.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the External IP addresses page.
Go to the External IP addresses page
Click Reserve static address .
Under Type , select Regional , and then select
a region where Standard Tier is supported .
Under Network Service Tier , select Standard .
Populate other fields
as appropriate.
Click Reserve .
gcloud
gcloud compute addresses create my-standard-tier-ip-address \
--region REGION \
--network-tier STANDARD
Replace REGION with the region where you are creating the
regional IP address.
For other command-line flags, see
gcloud compute addresses .
API
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /addresses
{
"name": "my-standard-tier-ip-address",
"networkTier": "STANDARD"
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID
REGION : the region where you are creating the
forwarding rule
Terraform
You can use a
Terraform resource
to set the network tier for a regional external IP address.
This example sets the tier to STANDARD .
resource "google_compute_address" "ip-address" {
project = var.project_id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes
name = "my-standard-tier-ip-address"
region = "us-central1"
network_tier = "STANDARD"
}
Creating forwarding rules
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or the following IAM roles.
Permissions
forwardingRules.insert , which requires
compute.addresses.use if a static external IP address is to be used and
compute.*.use on the target of the forwarding rule
(instance, target pool, proxy).
Roles
roles/compute.networkAdmin
When creating a new forwarding rule, you can specify the network tier; the
possible values are PREMIUM (default) and STANDARD . If you don't specify a
network tier, the forwarding rule is created using the
project default tier :
If you specify an external IP address with the --address flag, that IP address
must be in the same tier that you specify for the forwarding rule.
If you create a forwarding rule and do not specify the --address flag,
Google Cloud allocates an ephemeral IP address of the appropriate tier.
Standard Tier is only available for regional forwarding rules. Global
forwarding rules always use Premium Tier.
A load balancer can use both Premium Tier and Standard Tier by having
two different forwarding rules, one for each tier. This can be useful in
scenarios where one application requires the lower latency that Premium Tier
can provide, and another application, perhaps serving static content, works well
with higher latency and can be in Standard Tier.
Console
To create a Standard Tier forwarding rule in the Google Cloud console, you
must create or update an existing load balancer. Load balancers that have
backend services in more than one region cannot use Standard Tier. For
instructions about choosing and creating a load balancer, see the
load balancing documentation.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Load balancing page.
Go to the Load balancing page
Click the name of an existing load balancer, and then click
Edit edit .
Click Frontend configuration .
Click Add Frontend IP and port .
Under Network Service Tier , click Standard .
Populate other fields as appropriate.
Click Done , and then click Update .
gcloud
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create my-standard-tier-regional-rule \

of the load balancer
REGION : the region where you are creating the
forwarding rule
TARGET_HTTP_PROXY or
TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY or
TARGET_SSL_PROXY or TARGET_TCP_PROXY
or TARGET_POOL or TARGET_INSTANCE :
the appropriate target for the rule, depending on which target flag
you specified
For other command-line flags, see
gcloud compute forwarding-rules .

}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID
REGION : the region where you are creating the
forwarding rule
TARGET_HTTP_PROXY or
TARGET_HTTPS_PROXY or
TARGET_SSL_PROXY or TARGET_TCP_PROXY
or TARGET_POOL or TARGET_INSTANCE :
the appropriate target for the rule, depending on which target flag you
specified
Terraform
You can use a
Terraform resource
to set the network tier for a forwarding rule. This example sets the tier to
STANDARD for a forwarding rule that points to a target instance.
resource "google_compute_forwarding_rule" "target-fr" {
project = var.project_id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes
name = "target-instance-forwarding-rule"
region = "us-east4"
target = google_compute_target_instance.target.id
port_range = "80"
network_tier = "STANDARD"
}
VM instances
Use the procedures in the following sections to create VM instances in a given
network service tier, add an access configuration to an instance, or update
the network tier of an instance.
Creating VM instances
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or the following IAM roles.
Permissions
instances.insert , which requires
compute.instances.create on the project,
compute.subnetworks.use on the subnetwork,
compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp on the subnetwork, and
compute.address.use on a static external IP address, if
specifying one.
Roles
roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1
When creating an instance that connects directly to the internet, you can
specify the network tier. The possible values are PREMIUM (default) and
STANDARD . If you don't specify a network tier, the address is created using
the project default tier .
The network tier is only relevant if the instance communicates
directly with the internet with a regional IPv4 address. For response traffic
sent by a load balancer, the forwarding rule's network tier applies.
If assigning a static external IP address by using a reserved IP address, the
network tier of the IP address must match the network tier of the
instance. If assigning an ephemeral external IP address, the network tier of
the instance is used to assign an IP address from the corresponding pool.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page.
Go to the VM instances page
Click Create instance .
Click Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy .
Click the Networking tab.
Under Network interfaces , on the default network interface, click
Edit edit .
Under Network Service Tier , select Standard .
Populate other fields
as appropriate.
Click Create .
gcloud
gcloud compute instances create my-standard-tier-instance \

}
],
"IPAddress": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /addresses/my-standard-tier-ip-address",
... other parameters
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID
ZONE : the zone where you are creating the instance
REGION : the region of the resource
For a list of other required and optional parameters, see
REST Resource: instances .
Terraform
You can use a
Terraform resource
to set the network tier for a Compute Engine VM.
This example sets the tier to STANDARD .
resource "google_compute_address" "ip-address" {
project = var.project_id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes
name = "my-standard-tier-ip-address"
region = "us-central1"
network_tier = "STANDARD"
}
Adding an access configuration to an instance
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or the following IAM roles.
Permissions
compute.instances.addAccessConfig , which requires
compute.subNetworks.useExternalIp on the subnetwork, and
compute.address.use on a static external IP address, if
specifying one.
Roles
roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1
When creating an access configuration for an instance (that is, assigning an
ephemeral or static regional external IPv4 address to the network interface of
an instance), you can specify a network tier for the network interface of the
instance. Whether you specify an existing regional external IPv4 address or
create a new address, the address and instance's network interface must use
matching network service tiers. The possible values are PREMIUM and
STANDARD . If you don't specify a network tier and don't specify an IP address,
the instance's network interface and a new ephemeral regional external IPv4
address both use the
project default tier . If you
don't specify a network tier but do specify an IP address, Google Cloud returns
an error if the network tier of the IP address does not match the project
default tier.
gcloud
gcloud compute instances add-access-config INSTANCE_NAME \
--network-interface INTERFACE_NAME ; default="nic0" \
--access-config-name= ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME ; default="external-nat" \
--address= IP_ADDRESS \
--network-tier PREMIUM | STANDARD
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_NAME : the name of the instance
INTERFACE_NAME : the name of the interface; default
is nic0 (the name of the default interface on the instance)
ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME : the name of the access
configuration for the interface
IP_ADDRESS : the URL of the IP address resource, if
you are specifying an IP address
Note: If you do not specify a network-tier , the instance is created in the
project default tier.
API
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME /addAccessConfig?networkInterface=nic0

compute.subNetworks.useExternalIp on the subnetwork, and
compute.address.use on a static external IP address, if
specifying one.
Roles
roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1
You can use the update-access-config command to change the network tier of the
network interface of an instance. The possible values for the network tier are
PREMIUM and STANDARD . If the instance is already assigned a regional
external IPv4 address in the existing access config, you must first remove that
external IP address before you change the interface's network tier. For more
information about how the network tier of a regional external IPv4 address must
match the network tier of the instance's network interface, see
