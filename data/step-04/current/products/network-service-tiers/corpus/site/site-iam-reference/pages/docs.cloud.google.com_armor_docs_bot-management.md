Cloud Armor bot management overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Cloud Armor and reCAPTCHA
provide tools to help you evaluate and act on incoming requests that might be
from automated clients.
reCAPTCHA uses advanced risk analysis techniques to distinguish
between human users and automated clients.
reCAPTCHA assesses the user based on the configuration of
the reCAPTCHA WAF site keys. It then issues an encrypted token with attributes
that represent the associated risk. Cloud Armor deciphers this token
in-line, without an additional request or response to the reCAPTCHA
service. Based on the token attributes, Cloud Armor lets you allow,
deny, rate-limit or redirect the incoming requests. For more information, see
the
Cloud Armor and reCAPTCHA integration overview .
Cloud Armor's bot management includes the following integrated
capabilities.
Manual challenge (reCAPTCHA challenge page)
You must configure a security policy rule to redirect a request for
reCAPTCHA assessment.
You can create your own reCAPTCHA WAF site key and associate
it with your security policy. We strongly recommend that you do this.
For more information, see
Implement a reCAPTCHA challenge .
You can permit only end-users who pass the reCAPTCHA
manual challenge by redirecting end-users for reCAPTCHA
assessment.
Enforce reCAPTCHA frictionless assessment
You can take different actions on incoming requests based on
reCAPTCHA's assessment of the risk that the request
originates from a bot. You can write security policy rules to evaluate and
filter traffic based on the token score and other token attributes.
You must implement reCAPTCHA action-tokens, session-tokens,
or both. reCAPTCHA action-tokens are supported on applications running on
websites, iOS, and Android. reCAPTCHA session-tokens are supported only on
websites. For more information about reCAPTCHA tokens, see
reCAPTCHA action-tokens
and
reCAPTCHA session-tokens .
You must configure a security policy rule that evaluates
reCAPTCHA tokens.
To prevent token theft, we recommend that you associate your own
reCAPTCHA keys for WAF with your security policy rule.
Cloud Armor bot management also includes the following
capabilities.
Redirect (302)
You can redirect requests to your configured alternative URL by configuring
Cloud Armor to serve an HTTP 302 response to the client.
Decorate request
You can insert custom headers in requests, and static values into those
headers, before proxying a requests to your backends.
Note: For mobile applications, only reCAPTCHA action-tokens are
supported. The manual challenge (reCAPTCHA challenge page), and
session-tokens aren't supported.
Use cases
This section describes how you can use Cloud Armor bot management
capabilities to mitigate bot risk and to control access from automated clients.
Use a manual challenge to distinguish between legitimate users and automated clients
You can redirect a request to reCAPTCHA to assess the end-client
and serve manual challenges if necessary, without any additional
reCAPTCHA implementation. When human users share the same
signature (such as URL paths or other L7 signatures) as a bot or an abusive
system, this action provides a way for them to prove that they are human. Only
users who pass the assessment can gain access to your service.
The following diagram shows how a manual challenge distinguishes whether a
request comes from a human or an automated client:
Example of redirecting to reCAPTCHA (click to
enlarge).
Suppose a user Maya and a bot are both browsing the login page
( /login.html ) on your site. To allow access to Maya without
granting access to the bot, you can configure a security policy rule with the
advanced match expression request.path.matches("/login.html") , with a
redirect action of type GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA . The end-to-end user experience
is as follows:
An end user visits your site for the first time.
Cloud Armor evaluates the request, and determines to
redirect it to reCAPTCHA.
reCAPTCHA responds with an HTML page with the
reCAPTCHA JavaScript embedded.
When the response is rendered, the embedded JavaScript runs to assess the user,
and serves manual challenges if necessary.
If the user passes the assessment, reCAPTCHA issues an
exemption cookie, which is auto-attached by the browser to each of
the subsequent requests to the same site until the cookie expires.
Otherwise, reCAPTCHA does not issue an exemption cookie.
In this example, only Maya passes reCAPTCHA assessment and
receives an exemption cookie, gaining access to your site.
When you use manual challenges, we recommend that you create your own
reCAPTCHA WAF site key and associate it with the security policy.
This lets you view reCAPTCHA metrics associated with the
site key and train a security model specific to the site key. For more
information, see
Create reCAPTCHA WAF challenge site key .
If you don't create and associate a site key, reCAPTCHA uses
a Google-managed site key during assessment. You cannot view reCAPTCHA metrics
associated with site keys that you don't own, including Google-managed site
keys.
Enforce reCAPTCHA assessment
When there is a reCAPTCHA token attached to an incoming request,
Cloud Armor evaluates the request and applies the configured action
based on the individual attributes in the token. Cloud Armor security
policy evaluation happens at the edge of Google's network, so your backends are
not involved in deciphering the token.
reCAPTCHA tokens
reCAPTCHA issues two types of tokens: action-tokens and
session-tokens. Both types of token return a score for each request based on the
interactions with your site or app. Both types of tokens contain attributes,
including a score that represents the risk associated with the user. They also
contain information about the reCAPTCHA key that you used when
the token was generated.
Before you configure security policy rules, you must decide whether to use
action-tokens, session-tokens, or both. We recommend reading the
reCAPTCHA documentation to inform your decision. For more
information, see the
reCAPTCHA use case comparison .
After determining which type of token you want to use, you implement
reCAPTCHA for the token to be attached with a
request. For information about implementing tokens in reCAPTCHA,
see the following pages:
Web applications
Implement reCAPTCHA action-tokens
Implement reCAPTCHA session-tokens
Mobile applications
Implement reCAPTCHA action-tokens
Finally, use the Cloud Armor rules language to configure security
policy rules to evaluate reCAPTCHA tokens that are attached
with the request. To prevent token theft, we strongly recommend that you
associate your reCAPTCHA keys with your security policy rules.
When you associate reCAPTCHA keys with a security policy rule,
Cloud Armor performs additional validation on the token by comparing
the reCAPTCHA key in the token against reCAPTCHA keys that are associated with
the rule. Cloud Armor considers a token with an unknown reCAPTCHA key
as invalid. For more information, see
enforce reCAPTCHA frictionless assessment .
The following figure demonstrates the reCAPTCHA token enforcement
flow.

Redirect (302 response)
You can use a URL-based redirect action to externally redirect requests to a
different endpoint. You supply a redirect target in the form of a URL, and
Cloud Armor redirects the request by serving an HTTP 302 response to
the client.
Decorate request
Cloud Armor can insert custom request headers with static user-defined values before proxying the
requests to your application. This option lets you tag suspicious
requests for alternative downstream processing, like serving a honey-pot, or for
additional analysis and monitoring. Note that this action
parameter must be added to an existing allow action.
Custom headers
If you have configured Cloud Armor to insert a custom header or value
with the same header name as one of the custom headers for the global external Application Load Balancer
or the classic Application Load Balancer, then the header value is
overwritten by the load balancer. For more information, see
Creating custom headers in backend services .
In addition, if you choose a header name that already exists in the request,
including standard HTTP headers, then the original value in that header is
overwritten by the user-defined value provided to the Cloud Armor rule.
Integrate with rate limiting
Cloud Armor rate limiting rules are compatible with bot management
capabilities. For example, you can redirect a request for reCAPTCHA
assessment or redirect to a different URL when the number of requests exceeds
the configured threshold. In addition, you can identify clients for rate
limiting based on reCAPTCHA exemption cookies or tokens, to
throttle requests or ban clients that reuse or abuse the same cookie or token
at a rate exceeding the user-configured threshold.
Rate limit reCAPTCHA exemption cookies or tokens
For security, we recommend that you configure rate limiting rules to prevent
token abuse through multiple uses per unique reCAPTCHA action-token,
session-token, or exemption cookie. The following table illustrates how you can
identify a reCAPTCHA exemption cookie or token as the key in a
rate limiting rule.

Exemption cookie
HTTP-COOKIE
recaptcha-ca-e
Action-token
HTTP-HEADER
X-Recaptcha-Token
Session-token
HTTP-COOKIE
recaptcha-ca-t
You can throttle requests or ban clients that depend on the same exemption
cookie or token, and that exceed the configured threshold. For more information
about rate limiting parameters, see
Apply rate limiting .
Rate limiting examples
First, suppose that you only use manual challenges on selected URLs
( /login.html , for example) on your site. To accomplish this, configure
security policy rules as follows:
Rule 1: If there is a valid exemption cookie attached with the request and
the number of uses for the exemption cookie is under your defined threshold,
allow the request.
Rule 2: Redirect the request for reCAPTCHA assessment.
Enforce manual challenges (click to enlarge).
Second, suppose that you only use action-tokens or session-tokens on your site.
For example, you might use action-tokens to protect high-profile user actions,
like /login.html . To do this, take actions based on the score from the
action-token as follows:
Rule 1: When the score from the action-token is higher than a predefined threshold
( 0.8 , for example), allow the request if the number of uses for the
action-token is under your defined threshold.
Rule 2: Deny the request.
Enforce reCAPTCHA action-token assessment (click to
enlarge).
You can configure similar security policy rules to enforce
reCAPTCHA session-token assessment.
Third, suppose that you combine action-tokens or session-tokens with manual challenges
on selected URLs (like /login.html ) on your site, and you want to take actions
based on the score from the action-token. And you want to give the user a second
chance by solving challenges if the score is not satisfactory enough. To do this,
configure security policy rules as follows:
Rule 1: When the score from the action-token is higher than a predefined threshold
( 0.8 , for example), allow the request if the number of uses for the
action-token is under your defined threshold.
Rules 2 and 3: When the score from the action-token is higher than a different predefined
threshold ( 0.5 , for example), redirect the request for
reCAPTCHA assessment unless there is a valid exemption cookie
attached to the request and the number of uses for the exemption cookie is
under your defined threshold.
Rule 4: Deny the request.
Enforce reCAPTCHA action-token assessment with manual challenges (click to
enlarge).
You can configure similar security policy rules to enforce
reCAPTCHA session-token assessment with manual challenges.
If you don't tune the rate limiting rules, Cloud Armor
imposes no limit on the number of uses for each reCAPTCHA exemption cookie,
action-token, and session-token. For action-tokens, we recommend using a low
threshold ( 1 , for example) and a high time interval ( 30 minutes for example,
since action-tokens are valid for 30 minutes). We recommend that you derive the
threshold based on your traffic statistics.
