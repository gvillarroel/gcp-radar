Automatically deploy Adaptive Protection suggested rules
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides configuration steps for automatically deploying the
suggested rules that Adaptive Protection generates. To enable automatic rule
deployment, you must create a placeholder rule with the following values:
Match expression: evaluateAdaptiveProtectionAutoDeploy()
Action: Any
Priority: Any. We recommend that you set an explicit allow rule at a
higher priority than your other rules for high-priority, legitimate traffic.
If you use an upstream proxy in front of your external Application Load Balancer, such as a
third-party CDN, you can configure the placeholder rule to match requests based
on the original client's IP address from a specified header or headers. To use
this preview feature, configure the userIpRequestHeaders[] option in the
advancedOptionsConfig field. For more information, see the
ComputeSecurityPolicy
resource reference.
Example placeholder rules
The following commands are example placeholder rules for security policies
called POLICY_NAME , each of which features a different rule action.
You can add these rules to an existing security policy or create a new policy. For
more information about creating security policies, see
Configure Cloud Armor security policies .
Block malicious traffic
This example rule evaluates to true for requests that Adaptive Protection
identifies as attack traffic. Cloud Armor applies the blocking
action to the attacking request:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluateAdaptiveProtectionAutoDeploy()" \
--action deny-403
Redirect malicious traffic to a reCAPTCHA challenge
This example rule redirects traffic that Adaptive Protection identifies as
malicious to a reCAPTCHA challenge:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluateAdaptiveProtectionAutoDeploy()" \
--action redirect \
--redirect-type google-recaptcha
Rate limit malicious traffic
This example applies Cloud Armor rate limiting to traffic that
Adaptive Protection identifies as malicious:
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
--security-policy POLICY_NAME \
--expression "evaluateAdaptiveProtectionAutoDeploy()" \
--action throttle \
--rate-limit-threshold-count 500 \
--rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec 120 \
--conform-action allow \
--exceed-action deny-404 \
--enforce-on-key ip
Configure Adaptive Protection auto-deploy parameters
You can configure the thresholds for automatic deployment of rules by tuning the
following parameters. If you don't set the value for a parameter,
Cloud Armor uses the default value.
Load threshold: during an alerted attack, Adaptive Protection identifies
new attackers only when the load to the backend service that is under attack
exceeds this threshold. In addition, rules are only automatically deployed for
alerts when the load to the backend service that is under attack exceeds this
threshold.
Default value: 0.8
Caution : Setting the load threshold field has no effect on
serverless backends. The load threshold value isn't used for detecting an
attack nor for triggering auto-deployment for backend services that are
configured with the following network endpoint groups (NEGs):
A serverless NEG sending traffic to
App Engine ,
Cloud Run , or
Cloud Run functions .
An internet NEG sending traffic to an external origin.
Confidence threshold: rules are only automatically deployed for alerts on
potential attacks with confidence scores greater than this threshold.
Default value: 0.5
Impacted baseline threshold: rules are only automatically deployed when the
estimated impact to baseline traffic from the suggested mitigation is
below this threshold. impactedBaselineProportion and
impactedbaselinePolicyProportion should be lower than the impacted baseline
threshold.
Default value: 0.01 (1%)
Expiration set: Cloud Armor stops applying the action in the
automatically deployed rule to an identified attacker after this duration.
The rule continues to operate against new requests.
Default value: 7200 seconds
Note: The auto-deploy action triggers only when all three thresholds
(load threshold, confidence threshold, and impacted baseline threshold) are met.
For example, even if Adaptive Protection confidently detects an attack and
generates a targeted attack signature with minimal baseline impact, auto-deploy
still does not act if the backend service under attack is significantly
over-provisioned such that the load balancer sees its load below the configured
load threshold during the attack.
The following command adds Layer 7 DDoS defense threshold configurations to
security policies.
gcloud compute security-policies add-layer7-ddos-defense-threshold-config NAME
[ FLAG = VALUE ]
Replace the following:
NAME : the name of the security policy.
FLAG : the defense threshold parameter.
VALUE : the value of the defense threshold parameter.
For more information, see Configure granular traffic units .
The following command updates the security policy to use non-default,
automatically deployed thresholds. You can set at most one of the
auto_deploy_config and threshold_config parameters. Setting more than one
flag causes an error.
gcloud beta compute security-policies update NAME [
--layer7-ddos-defense-auto-deploy- PARAMETER VALUE
]
Replace the following:
NAME : the name of the security policy.
PARAMETER : the auto-deploy parameter. It is one of the following:
load-threshold
confidence-threshold
impacted-baseline-threshold
expiration-sec
VALUE : the value of the auto-deploy parameter.
Logging
Logs generated by rules automatically deployed with Adaptive Protection have
the following additional fields:
autoDeployed : after you configure automatic rule deployment, each alert log
that Adaptive Protection generates has the boolean field autoDeployed ,
which indicates whether an automatic defense was triggered.
When autoDeployed is set to true , it indicates that the
evaluateAdaptiveProtectionAutoDeploy() placeholder rule has already
evaluated that the attack Confidence and Impacted baseline thresholds
have exceeded the configured auto-deploy parameters. The system then
begins to monitor the dynamic load. Once the load surpasses the configured
load threshold, the rule is automatically deployed to mitigate the attack.
adaptiveProtection.autoDeployAlertId : whenever Adaptive Protection takes
an action on a request as part of an automatic defense, the request log has
the additional adaptiveProtection.autoDeployAlertId field, which records the
alert ID. This field appears under enforcedSecurityPolicy or
previewSecurityPolicy , depending on whether the security policy is in
preview mode.
To view request logs, see Use request logging . The
following screenshot shows an example of an Adaptive Protection log entry,
with the autoDeployed and adaptiveProtection.autoDeployAlertId fields.

Limitations
Adaptive Protection is only available for backend security policies
attached to backend services that are exposed through an external Application Load Balancer.
Adaptive Protection is not available for external proxy Network Load Balancers.
