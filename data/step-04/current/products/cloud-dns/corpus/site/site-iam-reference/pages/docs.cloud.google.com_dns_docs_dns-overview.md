General DNS overview

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides an overview of the Domain Name System (DNS).
For an overview of Cloud DNS, see the
Cloud DNS overview . For key terms related
to Cloud DNS, see Key terms .
DNS is a hierarchical distributed database that stores IP addresses and other
data and allows queries by name.
In other words, DNS is a directory of readable domain names that translate to
numeric IP addresses used by computers to communicate with each other. For
example, when you type a URL into a browser, DNS converts the URL into an IP
address of a web server associated with that name. The DNS directories are
stored and distributed around the world on domain name servers that are updated
regularly.
The following concepts are useful when working with DNS.
DNS server types
A DNS server stores a database of domain names, and then processes domain names
based on DNS queries that come from a client in a network.
Authoritative server
An authoritative server is a server that holds the DNS name records,
including A, AAAA, and CNAME.
A non-authoritative server constructs a cache file based on
previous queries for domains. It does not hold original name records.
Recursive resolver
A recursive resolver is the server that sends a query to the authoritative
or non-authoritative server for resolution. A recursive resolver is so-called
because it performs each query for a given name and returns the final result.
This is in contrast to an iterative resolver , which only returns a referral
to the next DNS servers that might have the answer.
For example, when resolving the name google.com. , the recursive resolver
must determine who is authoritative for . (the root zone of DNS). Then it asks
those name servers who is authoritative for .com. . Finally, it asks those name
servers who is authoritative for google.com. , and the rdata for the A record
is returned to the client.
Following is an example of a recursive resolver in action; if you run
dig +trace google.com , the recursive resolver performs the following
action (8.8.8.8/Google Public DNS is one such resolver):
dig +trace google.com
; > DiG 9.11.5-P4-5.1-Debian > +trace google.com
;; global options: +cmd

Each DNS client queries a name server. A recursive resolver queries other name
servers, all the way up to a top-level name server, if necessary. The
NS record for a zone on an upper-level name
server directs the resolver down to another name server, eventually reaching
either a name server that cached the zone or the authoritative server for the
zone.
Zones
Public zone
A public zone is visible to the internet. You can create DNS records in a
public zone to publish your service on the internet. For example, you might
create an A record in a public zone called example.com. (note the trailing
dot) for your public website www.example.com. .
Private zone
A private zone is any zone that cannot be queried over the public internet.
Delegated subzone
DNS allows the owner of a zone to use NS records to delegate a subdomain to a
different name server. Resolvers follow these records and send queries for
the subdomain to the target name server specified in the delegation.
For example, you can create separate zones for both example.com and
subdomain.example.com , each with its own authoritative name server. Because
subdomain.example.com is a child domain of example.com , the method to enable
the authoritative name server for the subdomain to be located from the parent
domain's zone is called delegation. Delegation is essentially a pointer to the
authoritative name server for a subdomain. To enable delegation in
Cloud DNS, you can add NS records for the subdomains in the zone
of the parent domain.
Split horizon DNS
Split horizon is a term used to describe an instance when two zones, one to be
used by the internal network and the other to be used by the external network
(usually the internet), are created for the same domain. Split-horizon DNS
lets you serve different answers (different resource record sets) for the
same name depending on who is asking.
For example, you can provide the development or staging version of your
application if the query comes from the development network, and the production
or public version of your app if the query comes from the public internet.
Records
A record is a mapping between a DNS resource and a domain name. Each individual
DNS record has a type (name and number), an expiration time (time to live), and
type-specific data.
Some of the commonly used record types are:
A: Address record, which maps host names to their IPv4 address.
AAAA: IPv6 Address record, which maps host names to their IPv6
address.
CNAME: Canonical name record, which specifies alias names.
MX: Mail exchange record, which is used in routing requests to mail
servers.
NS: Name server record, which delegates a DNS zone to an authoritative
server.
PTR: Pointer record, which defines a name associated with an IP address.
SOA: Start of authority, used to designate the primary name server and
administrator responsible for a zone. Each zone hosted on a DNS server must
have an SOA (start of authority) record. You can modify the record as needed
(for example, you can change the serial number to an arbitrary number to
support date-based versioning).
Record sets
Records with the same name and of the same type but with different
data values are called record sets. When you create a record, if a set with the
same name and type exists, the record is added to this matching set.
If there's no matching set, a new set is created and appended to the list of
record sets.
This is an example of a record set with more than one record having the same
name and type:
DNS name
Type
TTL (seconds)
Data
db-01.dev.gcp.example.com
A
50
10.128.1.35
db-01.dev.gcp.example.com
A
50
10.128.1.10
For a list of supported record types in Cloud DNS, see
Supported DNS record types .
Delegation of subdomains
When creating records, make sure that the NS and SOA records match each
other. Conflicting NS and SOA records can cause some resolvers to reject the
delegation as invalid and refuse to cache NO DATA responses to queries.
This can result in a large unexpected number of queries against your public
managed zones by third-party recursive resolvers when resolvers query your
public managed zones for records that don't exist.
For example, suppose that there are two subdomains, example.com and
subdomain.example.com in Cloud DNS. The NS and SOA records for
subdomain.example.com don't match. Neither of the zones contains any AAAA
records. When some third-party recursive resolvers query subdomain.example.com
for an AAAA record and receive a NO DATA response, if the resolvers detect
the invalid delegation of subdomain.example.com , they refuse to cache the
non-existence of AAAA records in that zone. This results in retrying the
queries. They query all the Cloud DNS name servers, in turn, for this
information.
Registrar
A domain name registrar is an organization that manages the reservation of
internet domain names for public zones. A registrar must be accredited by a
generic top-level domain (gTLD) registry or a country code top-level domain
(ccTLD) registry. This is how upper-level name servers agree on SOA and update
NS records for the zone to direct requests to caching or authoritative name
servers.
SOA serial number
The SOA serial number is a version number for a DNS zone. For all name servers
to be current with the version of a zone, they must have the same SOA
serial number. The serial numbers of SOA records created in DNS managed zones
monotonically
increase with each transactional change to a zone's record sets.
However, you can change the serial number of an SOA record to an arbitrary
number, including an ISO 8601-formatted date, as recommended in
RFC 1912 .
DNSSEC
The Domain Name System Security Extension (DNSSEC) addresses vulnerabilities
to DNS data. DNSSEC is a suite of IETF specifications that provides
authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data
integrity to DNS clients (resolvers). In short, DNSSEC provides a way for
software to verify the origin of DNS data and validate that it has not been
modified in transit.
For more details about DNSSEC, see RFC 4033 .
For a list of general DNS terminology, see
RFC 7719 .
