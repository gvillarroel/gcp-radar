Error messages
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes common error messages that you might receive
when using Cloud DNS, what the messages mean, and recommended actions
for resolving the errors.
General errors
This section describes general errors.
alreadyExists
The specified resource already exists; you cannot create a duplicate.
Recommended action: When creating a resource, use the appropriate get/list
API to discover what resources already exist.
If you get this error when adding records, it is because an individual record is
treated as a record set, which means each entry (if you have multiple entries)
acts as a different record. You can add two values or strings to the record set
for the same Domain Name System (DNS) name by adding a space between the first
value and the second value.
accessNotConfigured
Access not configured
To resolve this error, you must
enable the Cloud DNS API
for your project.
inactiveBillingState
Project example_project cannot accept requests while in an inactive
billing state. Billing state might take several minutes to update.
Recommended action: Enable billing for your project. To enable billing for a
new project, or to re-enable billing for an existing project, follow the
appropriate steps in Enable billing for a project .
preconditionFailed
This is a generic error that means that something about the request is not
compatible with the current state of the server resource. The client must do
something to fix it and then try again. This can happen if you send a create
change request that tries to delete a resource record set that doesn't match the
one that already exists (same name and type).
Read the current state of the zone and decide what you want to delete. It
might have changed since you last looked at it.
The error message includes the path to the problematic part of your request. For
example, entity.change.deletions[6] refers to the seventh element in the
deletions array of the change object in the POST body of your request.
Recommended action: Fix the part of the request that is flagged as
problematic.
required
This is a generic error that means that some required part of the request is missing.
For example, the request to create a managed zone requires a name, a DNS name,
and a description. If any of these fields is missing, the request fails with
this error.
Recommended action: Fill in the required parameter and try again.
notFound
The specified resource does not exist.
Recommended action: Make sure that you are using the name of an existing
resource.
quotaExceeded
You get this error when an impending change would exceed your current quota.
The quota is associated with the project. For example, you are only allowed a
certain number of resource record sets in each zone. If you need a quota increase,
contact your Google Cloud sales team. New projects have a default
quota as specified in
Cloud DNS resource quotas and limits .
For all the different dimensions that DNS limits, see the
Projects.get operation.
Recommended action: Check your project to understand why you are already
using so much of that resource. You can request increased quota for a project on
the Quotas page
of the Google Cloud console for the project. You can also refer to
Request a quota adjustment .
Errors relating to managed zones
This section lists errors relating to managed zones.
invalidFieldValue
Invalid value for entity.managedZone.name .
The operation to create a managed zone can fail with this error if the managed
zone name does not begin with a letter, end with a letter or digit, and
contain only lowercase letters, digits, or dashes.
managedZoneDnsNameNotAvailable
The specified managed zone is not available and thus, cannot be created.
The operation to create a managed zone can fail with this error for the
following reasons:
The DNS name of the proposed zone is reserved, for example, dot ( . ),
.com , or .co.uk .
There are no more name servers available to host the DNS name of the zone.
Cloud DNS uses a pool of name servers, and that pool is finite.
A DNS query to any name server must map unambiguously to one managed zone.
For more details, see nameserver limits .
Recommended action: If you are the registered owner of the DNS name in
question, check for overlapping zones. To set up DNS for a domain and
its subdomains, we recommend creating a single parent zone first and adding
records for each subdomain in that zone.
verifyManagedZoneDnsNameOwnership
Verify ownership of the example.com domain (or a parent), and then try again.
Recommended action: When you receive this error, you must
verify domain ownership ,
and then try again.
Errors relating to managed records
The errors in this section relate to records.
containerNotEmpty
The specified resource cannot be deleted because it is not empty.
Recommended action: If you want to delete the resource, you must empty it
first.
invalidZoneApex
The specified resource record set is invalid because a zone must contain
exactly one resource record set of a certain type at the apex.
Apex in the DNS context means the DNS name with the fewest number of
labels that are allowed in the zone. It is also the top of the zone hierarchy.
The apex of a zone is the DNS name equal to
ManagedZone.dnsName .
This error means that you tried to make a change that would violate the DNS rule
that a zone must contain exactly one resource record set of a certain type at
the apex. The following actions can cause this error:
You tried to delete the required NS resource record set at the apex.
You tried to delete the required SOA resource record set at the apex.
You tried to create a resource record set of type SOA not at the apex.
Recommended action: If you get this error, you are trying to do something
that isn't allowed under the rules of DNS. Check your request for mistakes.
There is no need to delete the required resource record sets.
invalidRecordCount
The resource record set entity.change.additions[XX] is only
permitted to have one record because it is of type <SOA_OR_CNAME> .
The rules of DNS say that SOA and CNAME resource record sets can only have
one resource record. You get this error if you try to create a change that would
break those rules. For example:
{
kind: "dns#rrset"
name: "blog.example.com.",
type: "CNAME",
rrdata: [ "www.example.com.", "www2.example.com." ],
...
}
Recommended action: If you get this error, check your request. You are
trying to do something that isn't allowed.
cnameResourceRecordSetConflict
The resource record set entity.change.additions[XX] is invalid
because the DNS name example.com might have either one CNAME resource
record set or resource record sets of other types, but not both.
This error occurs when you create two types of resource record sets, such as
both an A record and a CNAME record for the same DNS name. A common cause of
this error is trying to create a CNAME record at the zone apex. This is not
possible because it would conflict with the required SOA and NS records of
the same name.
Recommended action: Pick one or the other.
wildcardNotAllowed
The specified resource record set has the wrong type to be a wildcard.
In DNS, a
wildcard
is a special type of resource record set that matches
requests for non-existent domain names. One limitation of
Cloud DNS is that you cannot create a wildcard resource
record set of type NS .
Recommended action: Wildcard NS resource record sets are not supported at
this time. Contact Cloud DNS Support or join
cloud-dns-discuss
and share what you are trying to accomplish.
recordTypeDisallowedAtZoneApex
The specified resource record cannot exist alongside any other record type,
including the SOA record that is required at the zone apex.
You cannot place a CNAME resource record at the apex because it cannot
exist alongside any other resource record type, including the SOA resource
record that is required at the zone apex.
Recommended action: Use an ALIAS resource record. An ALIAS resource
record is a Cloud DNS custom record type that behaves like a CNAME
resource record but can only be used at the zone apex and only responds to
address record (A or AAAA) queries. For more information,
see Alias records .
invalidValue
This is a generic error that means something about your request was invalid,
independent of the server's state. The error message includes the path to the
problematic part of the request, as well as the invalid value. This error could
be triggered by many different things, such as:
You specified a resource record set with an invalid name. For example,
cymbal...group is not a valid DNS name (empty middle label).
You specified a resource record set with an invalid type. For example A
and CNAME are valid types, but group is not a valid type.
You specified a resource record set with no records in it.
You specified resource record data that is invalid. For example 1.1.1.1 is
valid resource record data for type A. X.X.X.X is invalid resource record
data for type A.
You specified a resource record set with an invalid TTL. The TTL must be a
non-negative integer.
You specified a resource name that is too long.
Recommended action: Fix your request.
Errors related to threat detection
This section describes common errors when enabling threat detection.
Privileged access only allowed from ThreatDetectorAdmin
You must have the Threat Detector Admin role to enable DNS threat detection.
Recommended action: You must be granted the roles/networksecurity.dnsThreatDetectorAdmin role.
FAILED_PRECONDITION
Another DNS threat detector already exists under the supplied parent.
Recommended action Inspect your current configuration state, and either use the existing DNS threat detector or remove it and create a new one.
gcloud
gcloud network-security dns-threat-detectors describe --location=global RESOURCE_REPORTED_IN_ERROR_MESSAGE
Replace RESOURCE_REPORTED_IN_ERROR_MESSAGE with the other DNS threat detector that already exists under the supplied parent in the error message.
