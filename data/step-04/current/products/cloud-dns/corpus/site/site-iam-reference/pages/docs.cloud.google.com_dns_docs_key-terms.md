This document provides key terminology that applies to Cloud DNS.
Review these terms to better understand how Cloud DNS works and
the concepts on which it is built.
The Cloud DNS API is built around projects ,
managed zones , record sets ,
and changes to record sets.
project
A Google Cloud console project is a container for resources, a domain for
access control, and the place where billing is configured
and aggregated. For more details, see
Creating and managing projects .
managed zone
The managed zone holds Domain Name System (DNS) records for the same DNS
name suffix (such as example.com ). A project can have multiple managed
zones, but they must each have a unique name. In Cloud DNS, the
managed zone is the resource that models a
DNS zone .
All records in a managed zone are hosted on the same Google-operated name
servers. These name servers respond to DNS queries against your managed zone
according to how you configure the zone. A project can contain multiple
managed zones. Charges accrue for each zone for each day that the managed
zone exists. Managed zones support
labels
that you can use to help organize your billing.
public zone
A public zone is visible to the internet. Cloud DNS has public
authoritative name servers that respond to queries about public zones
regardless of where the queries originate. You can create DNS records in a
public zone to publish your service on the internet. For example, you might
create the following record in a public zone example.com for your public
website www.example.com .

Cloud DNS assigns a set of name servers when a public zone is
created. For the DNS records in a public zone to be resolvable over the
internet, you must update the name server
setting of your domain registration at your
registrar.
Note: Cloud DNS public zones are authoritative, and NS (name server)
and SOA resource records are at the zone apex. You cannot delete these
types of records. For details, see
RFC 1034 .
For more information about how to register and set up your domain, see
Setting up a domain using
Cloud DNS .
private zone
Private zones enable you to manage custom domain names for your virtual
machine (VM) instances, load balancers, and other Google Cloud resources without
exposing the underlying DNS data to the public internet. A private zone is a
container of DNS records that can only be queried by one or more
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks that you authorize.
You must specify the list of authorized VPC networks that can
query your private zone when you create or update it. Only authorized networks
are allowed to query your private zone; if you do not specify any
authorized networks, you cannot query the private zone at all.
You can use private zones with Shared VPC . For
important information about using private zones with Shared VPC, see
Shared VPC considerations .
Private zones do not support DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) or custom
resource record sets of type NS. Requests for DNS records in private zones
must be submitted through the metadata server 169.254.169.254 , which is the
default internal name server for VMs created from
Google-supplied images .
You can submit queries to this name server from any VM that uses an authorized
VPC network. For example, you can create a private zone for
dev.gcp.example.com to host
internal DNS records for experimental applications. The following table shows
example records in that zone. Database clients can connect to the database
server db-01.dev.gcp.example.com by using its internal DNS name instead of
its IP address. Database clients resolve this internal DNS name by using the
host resolver on the VM, which submits the DNS query to the metadata server
169.254.169.254 . The metadata server acts as a recursive resolver to query
your private zone.

Private zones enable you to create
split horizon DNS
configurations. This is because
you can create a private zone with a different set of records, which overrides
the entire set of records in a public zone. You can then
control which VPC networks query the records in the private
zone. For example, see overlapping zones .
Service Directory
Service Directory is a managed service registry for
Google Cloud that enables you to register and discover services by using
HTTP or gRPC (using its Lookup API) in addition to using traditional DNS.
You can use Service Directory to register both
Google Cloud and non-Google Cloud services.
Cloud DNS enables you to create
Service Directory-backed zones, which are a type of private
zone containing information about your services and endpoints. You don't add
record sets to the zone; rather, they're inferred automatically based on the
configuration of the Service Directory namespace associated
with the zone. For more information about Service Directory,
see the Service Directory overview .
When you create a Service Directory-backed
zone , you cannot add
records to the zone directly; the data comes from the Service Directory
service registry.
Cloud DNS and reverse lookup for non-RFC 1918 addresses
By default, Cloud DNS forwards requests for PTR records of non-RFC
1918 addresses through the public internet. However, Cloud DNS also
supports reverse lookup of non-RFC 1918 addresses by using private zones.
After you configure a VPC network to use non-RFC 1918
addresses, you must configure a Cloud DNS private zone as a
managed reverse lookup zone . This
configuration enables Cloud DNS to resolve non-RFC 1918 addresses
locally instead of sending them over the internet.
When you create a managed reverse lookup DNS zone, you cannot add
records to the zone directly; the data comes from the Compute Engine
IP address data.
Cloud DNS also supports outbound forwarding to non-RFC 1918
addresses by privately routing those addresses within Google Cloud.
To enable this type of outbound forwarding, you must configure
a forwarding zone with specific forwarding path arguments. For details,
see Forwarding targets and routing methods .
forwarding zone
A forwarding zone is a type of Cloud DNS managed private zone that
forwards requests for that zone to the IP addresses of its forwarding targets.
For more information, see
DNS forwarding methods .
When you create a forwarding zone ,
you cannot add records to the forwarding zone directly; the data
comes from one or more configured target name servers or resolvers.
peering zone
A peering zone is a type of Cloud DNS managed private zone that
follows the name resolution order of
another VPC network. You can use it to resolve the names that
are defined in the other VPC network.
When you create a DNS peering zone , you
cannot add records to the zone directly; the data comes from the
producer VPC network according to its Name
resolution order .
response policy
A response policy is a Cloud DNS private zone concept that contains
rules instead of records. These rules can be used to achieve effects similar
to the DNS
response policy zone
(RPZ) draft concept
( IETF ).
The response policy feature lets you introduce customized rules in DNS
servers within your network that the DNS resolver consults during lookups.
If a rule in the response policy affects the incoming query, it is processed.
Otherwise, the lookup proceeds normally. For more information, see
Managing response policies and rules .
A response policy is different from an RPZ, which is an otherwise normal DNS
zone with specially formatted data that causes compatible resolvers to do
special things. Response policies are not DNS zones and are managed
separately in the API.
zone operations
Any changes that you make to managed zones in Cloud DNS are
recorded in the operations collection , which
lists managed zone updates (modifying descriptions or DNSSEC state or
configuration). Changes to record sets inside a zone are stored separately
in resource record sets, described later in this document.
Internationalized Domain Name (IDN)
An Internationalized Domain Name (IDN)
is an internet domain name that allows people all over the world to use a
language-specific script or alphabet, such as Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic,
Devanagari, Hebrew, or the Latin alphabet-based special characters in
domain names. This conversion is implemented by using
Punycode ,
which is a representation of Unicode characters that use ASCII. For
example, an IDN representation of .ελ is .xn--qxam . Some browsers,
email clients, and applications might recognize it and render it as .ελ
on your behalf. The
Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)
standard only allows for Unicode strings that are short enough to be
represented as a valid DNS label. For information about how you can use IDN
with Cloud DNS, see
Creating zones with Internationalized Domain Names .
registrar
A domain name registrar
is an organization that manages the reservation of internet domain names.
A registrar must be accredited by a generic top-level domain (gTLD) registry
or a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry.
internal DNS
Google Cloud creates internal DNS names for VMs automatically, even if
you do not use Cloud DNS. For more information about internal DNS,
see the internal DNS documentation .
delegated subzone
DNS lets the owner of a zone delegate a subdomain to a different name
server by using NS (name server) records. Resolvers follow these records and
send queries for the subdomain to the target name server specified in the delegation.
Note: Private zones do not support delegation of subdomains to different
name servers by using NS records.
resource record sets
A resource record set is a collection of DNS records with the same label,
class, and type, but with different data. Resource record sets hold the
current state of the DNS records that make up a managed zone. You can read
a resource record set, but you do not modify it directly. Rather, you edit
the resource record set in a managed zone by creating a Change request
in the changes collection . You can also
edit the resource record sets by using the ResourceRecordSets
API .
The resource record set reflects all your changes immediately.
However, there is a delay between when changes are made in the API and the
time that they take effect at your authoritative DNS servers. For
information about how to manage records, see
Add, update, and delete records .
Note: Consistent with DNS industry practices, Cloud DNS
name servers now randomize the order of the resource record sets when
multiple records exist in a set. This is normal DNS behavior and applies to
both public and
private Cloud DNS zones. Caching resolvers in the path might still
return record sets as originally cached, and not re-randomize the order on
subsequent responses.
resource record set change
To make a change to a resource record set, submit a Change or a
ResourceRecordSets
request containing additions or deletions. Additions and
deletions can be done in bulk or in a single atomic transaction, and take
effect at the same time in each authoritative DNS server.
For example, if you have an A record that looks like this:
www A 203.0.113.1 203.0.113.2
And you run a command that looks like this:
DEL www A 203.0.113.2
ADD www A 203.0.113.3
Your record looks like this after the bulk change:
www A 203.0.113.1 203.0.113.3
The ADD and DEL happen simultaneously.
SOA serial number format
The serial numbers of SOA records created in Cloud DNS
managed zones monotonically increase with each transactional change to a
zone's record sets made by using the gcloud dns record-sets transaction
command. However, you are free to manually change the serial number of an
SOA record to an arbitrary number, including an ISO 8601-formatted date as
recommended in RFC 1912.
For example, in the following SOA record, you can
change the serial number directly from the Google Cloud console by
entering the desired value into the third space-delimited field of the
record:
ns-gcp-private.googledomains.com. cloud-dns-hostmaster.google.com.
[serial number] 21600 3600 259200 300`
DNS server policy
A DNS server policy lets you access name resolution services
provided by Google Cloud in a VPC network with inbound
forwarding, or supersede the VPC name resolution
order with an outbound server
policy. For more information, see DNS server policies .
domain, subdomain, and delegation
Most subdomains are only records in the managed zone for the parent domain.
Subdomains that are delegated by creating NS (name server) records in
their parent domain's zone need to have their own zones as well.
Create managed public zones for parent domains in Cloud DNS
before creating any public zones for their delegated subdomains.
Do this even if you are hosting the parent domain on another DNS service.
If you have several subdomain zones but don't create the parent zone,
it can be complicated to create the parent zone later if you decide to move
it to Cloud DNS. For more
information, see Name server limits .
DNSSEC
The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
is a suite of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) extensions to DNS which
authenticate responses to domain name lookups. DNSSEC does not provide privacy
protections for those lookups, but prevents attackers from manipulating or
poisoning the responses to DNS requests.
DNSKEYs collection
The DNSKEYs collection holds the current state of the DNSKEY records used to
sign a DNSSEC-enabled managed zone. You can only read this collection; all
changes to the DNSKEYs are made by Cloud DNS. The DNSKEYs
collection has all the information that domain registrars require to
activate DNSSEC .
