Migrate to Cloud DNS
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cloud DNS supports the migration of an existing DNS domain from
another DNS provider to Cloud DNS. This procedure describes how
to complete the necessary steps: create a managed zone for your domain, export
the DNS configuration from your existing provider,
import your existing DNS configuration to Cloud DNS, update your
registrar's name server records, and then verify the migration.
Before you begin
If you have not yet used the Google Cloud CLI,
set up the gcloud CLI .
To specify the project name and authenticate with the Google Cloud console, run
the following command:
gcloud auth login
You can also specify the --project parameter for a command to operate
against a different project for that invocation.
Create a managed zone
To migrate an existing domain, first create a managed zone to contain your DNS
records. When you create a zone, the new zone isn't used until you update your
domain registration, point a resolver at it, or query one of your zone's name
servers.
gcloud
To create a zone, run the
dns managed-zones create
command:
gcloud dns managed-zones create --dns-name= example.com.
--description= A_ZONE EXAMPLE_ZONE_NAME
Replace the following:
example.com. : the DNS name
A_ZONE : a description of the zone
EXAMPLE_ZONE_NAME : the name to identify the DNS zone
Export your DNS configuration from your existing provider
To export your
zone file ,
see your provider's documentation. Cloud DNS supports the import
of zone files in BIND or YAML records format.
For example:
For Dyn ,
go to
Download Your Zone File .
For AWS Route 53 ,
which does not support export, you can use the open source
cli53
tool.
Import the record set
After you have the exported the file from your other provider, you can use
gcloud commands to import it into your managed zone.
To import record sets correctly, you must remove the apex records or use the
flags described on the gcloud tab.
gcloud
To import record sets, run the
dns record-sets import
command. The --zone-file-format flag tells import to expect a BIND zone
formatted file. If you omit this flag, import expects a YAML-formatted
records file:
gcloud dns record-sets import -z= EXAMPLE_ZONE_NAME
--zone-file-format path-to-example-zone-file
Replace EXAMPLE_ZONE_NAME with the name of your DNS zone.
Caution: If your
import file contains NS or SOA records for the apex of the zone, they will
conflict with the pre-existing Cloud DNS records. To use the
pre-existing Cloud DNS records (recommended),
ensure that you remove the NS or SOA records from your import file.
However, there are use cases for overriding this behavior; see the
following important information.
Caution: If your authoritative DNS
is split across multiple providers and you have a non-Cloud DNS
primary name server, then you must replace the Cloud DNS
SOA record with the record from the other provider. To do this, you must use
the --delete-all-existing flag when importing record sets to
replace the SOA records that Cloud DNS provides. Otherwise, the
update fails because the imported records conflict with the pre-existing
Cloud DNS records.
For similar reasons, you can specify that the NS records in the
import file be used instead of the pre-existing Cloud DNS
records by using the --delete-all-existing
and --replace-origin-ns flags together. Specifying an
NS record for the apex of a zone results in an error even if the
--replace-origin-ns flag is not specified. Either remove these
records from the import file or use both the --delete-all-existing
and --replace-origin-ns flags together if appropriate.
Note: Some DNS implementations
and providers export BIND zone files without
final periods on domain name data in CNAME, MX, PTR, and other records.
In zone files, Cloud DNS follows RFC standards and interprets all
domain names without a final period as relative to the DNS name of the zone.
Therefore, importing the following MX records into a zone with the DNS name
example.com results in identical (and probably undesired)
records for both:
in.smtp IN MX 5 gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com
in.smtp.example.com. IN MX 5 gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.example.com.
Before importing your zone files, check them to ensure that all names that
need final periods have them.
Verify DNS propagation
To monitor and verify that the Cloud DNS name servers have picked up
your changes, you can use the Linux watch and dig commands.
Note: The watch and dig commands are not gcloud commands and are not used
with the gcloud prefix. On non-Linux operating systems, you might need to
install the watch and dig commands.
gcloud and Linux
To look up your zone's Cloud DNS name servers, run the
dns managed-zones describe
command:
gcloud dns managed-zones describe EXAMPLE_ZONE_NAME
Replace EXAMPLE_ZONE_NAME with the name of your DNS
zone.
The output looks something like this:
nameServers:
- ns-cloud-a1.googledomains.com.
- ns-cloud-a2.googledomains.com.
- ns-cloud-a3.googledomains.com.
- ns-cloud-a4.googledomains.com.
In the output, the letter following the ns-cloud- part of the name is
referred to as the name server shard . There are five such shards
(letters A-E). For more information about shards, see
Name server limits .
Check if the records are available on the name servers.
watch dig example.com @ ZONE_NAME_SERVER
Replace ZONE_NAME_SERVER with one of the name servers
returned when you ran the previous command.
After you see your change, press Ctrl+C to exit.
The watch command runs the dig command every 2 seconds by default. You
can use this command to determine when your authoritative name server picks
up your change, which should happen within 120 seconds.
Update your registrar's name server records
Sign in to your registrar provider and change the authoritative name servers
to point to the name servers that are listed in the output of the
gcloud dns managed-zones describe command .
At the same time, make a note of the time to live (TTL) that your registrar has
set on the records. That tells you how long you have to wait before the new name
servers begin to be used.
Wait for changes and then verify
To get the authoritative name servers for your domain on the internet,
run the following Linux commands:
dig +short NS example.com
If the output shows that all changes have propagated, your task is complete.
If not, you can check intermittently or you can automatically run the command
every 2 seconds while you wait for the name servers to change. To do that, run
the following:
watch dig +short NS example.com
Ctrl+C exits the command.
If you're not using Linux, you can use the
nslookup command .
