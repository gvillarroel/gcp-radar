Records format (JSON)
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows the JSON formats for various Cloud DNS record types.
To get started using Cloud DNS, see the Quickstart .
To manage your DNS records, use the
ResourceRecordSets API .
Supported DNS record types
Cloud DNS supports the following types of records:
Record type
Description
A
Address record, which is used to map a host name to an IPv4 address.
Example of the resource record set representation:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "example.com." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"1.2.3.4"
],
"ttl" : 86400 ,
"type" : "A"
}
AAAA
IPv6 Address record, which is used to map a host name to an IPv6
address.
Example of the resource record set representation:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "example.com." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"2607:f8b0:400a:801::1005"
],
"ttl" : 86400 ,
"type" : "AAAA"
}
CNAME
Canonical name record, which is used to alias names.
Example of the resource record set representation:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "mail.example.com." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"example.com."
],
"ttl" : 86400 ,
"type" : "CNAME"
}
Note that the hostnames must end with periods or trailing dots
( . ) in the rrdatas fields to be
fully-qualified DNS names.
MX
Mail exchange record, which is used in routing requests to mail
servers.
Example of the resource record set representation:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "example.com." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"10 mail.example.com." ,
"20 mail2.example.com."
],
"ttl" : 86400 ,
"type" : "MX"
}
Note that the hostnames must end with periods or trailing dots
( . ) in the rrdatas fields to be
fully-qualified DNS names.
NAPTR
Naming authority pointer record, defined by
RFC 3403 .
Example of the resource record set representation:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "2.1.2.1.5.5.5.0.7.7.1.e164.arpa." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"100 10 \"u\" \"sip+E2U\" \"!^.*$!sip:information@foo.se!i\" ." ,
"102 10 \"u\" \"smtp+E2U\" \"!^.*$!mailto:information@foo.se!i\" ."
],
"ttl" : 300 ,
"type" : "NAPTR"
}
Note that the value in the final replacement field
of each rrdatas must end with a period or trailing dot
( . ) to be a fully-qualified DNS name.
This record type raises several escaping issues. Embedded quotes must
be escaped for use in JSON as demonstrated earlier. Also,
the regexp field frequently contains backslash characters,
and these must be double-escaped: once as required by the zone file
format and again as required by the JSON format. To demonstrate, the
example from RFC 3403 section 6.1 would be
represented in the JSON API as:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "cid.urn.arpa." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"100 10 \"\" \"\" \"!^urn:cid:.+@([^\\\\.]+\\\\.)(.*)$!\\\\2!i\" ."
],
"ttl" : 300 ,
"type" : "NAPTR"
}
NS
Name server record, which delegates a DNS zone to an authoritative
server.
Example of the resource record set representation:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "example.com." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"ns-cloud1.googledomains.com."
],
"ttl" : 86400 ,
"type" : "NS"
}
Note that the hostnames must end with periods or trailing dots
( . ) in the rrdatas fields to be
fully-qualified DNS names.
PTR
Pointer record, which is often used for reverse DNS lookups.
Example of the resource record set representation:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "2.1.0.10.in-addr.arpa." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"server.example.com."
],
"ttl" : 60 ,
"type" : "PTR"
}
Creates a mapping from the address 10.0.1.2 to the host
name server.example.com , which could be defined in the
managed zone named
0.10.in-addr.arpa .
SOA
Start of authority record, which specifies authoritative information
about a DNS zone. An SOA resource record is created for
you when you create your managed zone. You can modify the record as
needed.
Example of the resource record set representation:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "example.com." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"ns-cloud1.googledomains.com. dns-admin.google.com. 1 21600 3600 1209600 300"
],
"ttl" : 21600 ,
"type" : "SOA"
}
Note that the hostnames must end with periods or trailing dots
( . ) in the rrdatas fields to be
fully-qualified DNS names.
SPF
Sender policy framework record, which is used in email validation
systems.
Example of the resource record set representation:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "example.com." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"v=spf1 mx:example.com -all"
],
"ttl" : 21600 ,
"type" : "SPF"
}
SRV
Service locator record, which is used by some voice over IP, instant
messaging protocols, and other applications.
Example of the resource record set representation:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "sip.example.com." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"0 5 5060 sip.example.com."
],
"ttl" : 21600 ,
"type" : "SRV"
}
Note that the hostnames must end with periods or trailing dots
( . ) in the rrdatas fields to be
fully-qualified DNS names.
TXT
Text record, which can contain arbitrary text and can also be used
to define machine-readable data, such as security or abuse prevention
information.
Example of the resource record set representation:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "example.com." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"google-site-verification=xxxxxxxxxxxxYYYYYYXXX"
],
"ttl" : 21600 ,
"type" : "TXT"
}
The TXT record consists of a list of character strings
( RFC
1035 ). In zone file format, you write this as a sequence of white
space separated strings. Each string can be quoted or unquoted. If one
of your strings contains embedded white space, you must use the quoted
form, for example:
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "example.com." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"\"v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all\""
],
"ttl" : 21600 ,
"type" : "TXT"
}
The preceding resource record set consists of a single
TXT resource record that contains a single character
string with embedded spaces.
Wildcard DNS records
Wildcard records are supported for all record types, except for NS records.
For example, you might want to map all subdomains to the IP address 1.2.3.4
with the following Change request:
{
"additions" : [
{
"kind" : "dns#resourceRecordSet" ,
"name" : "*.example.com." ,
"rrdatas" : [
"1.2.3.4"
],
"ttl" : 21600 ,
"type" : "A"
}
]
}
