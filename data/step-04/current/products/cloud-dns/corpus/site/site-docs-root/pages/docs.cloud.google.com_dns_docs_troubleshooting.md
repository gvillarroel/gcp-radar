Troubleshoot Cloud DNS
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides solutions for common issues that you might encounter when
using Cloud DNS to create
public zones, private zones,
reverse lookup zones, forwarding zones, and resource records.
Public zones
This section covers issues with public zones.
Cannot create a public zone
If you get an attempted action failed error, it means that the Cloud DNS
API is not enabled on your project.
To enable the Cloud DNS API, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the API Library page.
Go to the API Library
For Select a recent project , select the Google Cloud project where
you want to enable the API.
On the API library page, use the Search for APIs & Services box to
search for Cloud DNS API . A page describing the API appears.
Click Enable .
Private zones
This section covers issues with private zones.
Private zone problems in Shared VPC service projects
For important information about using private zones with Shared VPC
networks, see Private zones and Shared VPC .
Cannot create a private zone, cannot list or create policies
You must have the DNS Administrator role to
perform various private zone actions, such as listing Domain Name System (DNS)
server policies or creating a private zone. This role can be granted through the
Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool .
Private zones not resolving in the same VPC network
First, make sure that you're performing the test from the same network.
Verify that your VM instance's primary interface is on the same network as the private zone that you have created
A virtual machine (VM) instance sends all traffic out of its primary interface
unless the traffic is destined for a subnet attached to one of the other
interfaces or if the VM has policy routing
configured. Make sure that your test VM has its primary interface on the same
network as the private zone that you're testing.
Determine that your VM is using:
gcloud compute instances describe VM_NAME \
--zone= GCE_ZONE \
--format="csv[no-heading](networkInterfaces['network'])"
Ensure that the network is in the list of networks authorized to query your
private zone:
gcloud dns managed-zones describe PRIVATE_ZONE_NAME \
--format="csv(privateVisibilityConfig['networks'])"
Verify that the DNS name in the query matches your zone
Google Cloud resolves a record according to the
name resolution order , using the zone with
the longest suffix to decide which zone to query for a given DNS name. Make sure
that the suffix for the record that you're querying matches at least one private
zone accessible in your VPC network. For example, Google Cloud
first looks for myapp.dev.gcp.example.lan in a zone that serves
dev.gcp.example.lan , if accessible, before it looks for it in a zone that
serves gcp.example.lan , if accessible.
The output of the following command shows the DNS suffix for a given private
zone:
gcloud dns managed-zones describe PRIVATE_ZONE_NAME \
--format="csv[no-heading](dnsName)"
Query for the DNS name using the metadata server
Use dig to submit the DNS name query directly to the Google Cloud
metadata server, 169.254.169.254 :
dig DNS_NAME @169.254.169.254
Use dig to query the VM's default name server:
dig DNS_NAME
If the output of the two dig commands produces different answers, check the
;; SERVER: section of the second command. The responding server must be the
metadata server, 169.254.169.254 . If it is not, then you've configured the
guest operating system to use a custom DNS name server instead of the default
Google Cloud metadata server. Cloud DNS private zones require
that you use the metadata server for name resolution. Both the Linux guest
environment and the Windows
guest environment
do this for you. If you've imported the image that you're using for a VM,
verify that the appropriate guest environment has been installed.
Private zones not resolving through Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect
First make sure that you can successfully query and resolve the DNS name from
within an authorized VPC
network .
Verify connectivity through Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect
Ensure that connectivity from an on-premises system to your VPC
network is operational. Specifically, TCP and UDP traffic on port 53 must be
able to leave your on-premises network and be delivered to your
VPC network. Verify the configuration of on-premises firewalls to
make sure that such egress traffic is allowed.
You can use any protocol, such as ping (ICMP), to test connectivity to a
sample VM in your VPC network from on-premises. While
Cloud DNS requests are not sent to Google Cloud VMs,
testing connectivity to a sample VM lets you verify connectivity through a
Cloud VPN tunnel or Cloud Interconnect connection. Make sure that
you configure an appropriate ingress allow firewall rule for the sample
Google Cloud VM because the implied deny ingress
rule blocks all incoming traffic
otherwise.
Ensure inbound forwarding is enabled for the authorized VPC network
Inbound forwarding must be enabled for each VPC network that is
authorized to query your Cloud DNS private zone. Use the following
command to list all policies:
gcloud dns policies list
Identify the network in the output table, and check for the Forwarding field
to see if forwarding is enabled.
Make sure the authorized network is a VPC network
DNS forwarding requires subnets, which are only available to VPC
networks , not legacy
networks .
gcloud compute networks list \
--format="csv[no-heading](name, SUBNET_MODE)"
Legacy networks are identified in the output as LEGACY .
Make sure there is a valid DNS forwarding address reserved in that network
The following command shows all the reserved DNS forwarding IP addresses in your
project.
gcloud compute addresses list \
--filter="purpose=DNS_RESOLVER" \
--format='csv[no-heading](address, subnetwork)'
You can add an AND clause to the filter to limit the output to only the
subnetwork that you care about.
Example:
--filter="name ~ ^dns-forwarding AND subnetwork ~ SUBNETWORK_NAME "
If you don't see an IP address in the network or region that you expected, file
a ticket with Google Cloud Support .
Run the dig command pointing the query at the address that you found in the
preceding command. Do so from a VM in the same network. This test verifies
that the inbound forwarder is working, and that the problem lies elsewhere.
dig DNS_NAME @10.150.0.1 # address returned by previous command
Repeat the same dig command but from an on-premises host across the VPN.
CNAME record defined in a private zone not working
Cloud DNS only chases CNAME records as described in
CNAME chasing .
Reverse lookup zones
This section provides troubleshooting tips for reverse lookup zones.
Some private zone issues also apply to reverse lookup zones. For additional
tips, see the Private zones troubleshooting section.
VM with non-RFC 1918 address not resolving
If you have a non-RFC 1918 address, reconcile your VM.
Reconciliate your VM with a non-RFC 1918 address
If you created a VM during the non-RFC 1918 alpha before
Cloud DNS support was launched, these VMs might not resolve
correctly. To resolve this issue, restart your VMs.
Forwarding zones
This section provides troubleshooting tips for forwarding zones.
Some private zone issues also apply to forwarding zones. For additional
tips, see the Private zones troubleshooting section.
Forwarding zones (outbound forwarding) not working
First make sure that you can successfully query and resolve the DNS name from
within an authorized VPC
network .
Forwarding queries from VMs in a consumer VPC network to a producer VPC network not working
If you are using DNS peering and you want to forward queries from VMs in
a consumer VPC network to a producer VPC network,
and then to one or more on-premises name servers, make sure that one of the
following prerequisites is met:
The producer VPC network has its dynamic routing mode
set to GLOBAL
The VM in the consumer VPC network is in the same region as the
VPN tunnel or Cloud Interconnect in the producer VPC
( Classic VPN only ) The producer VPC network has a static route
configured to send traffic destined for the on-premise name servers through the
Classic VPN tunnel. The producer VPC network must also have a VM or a
VPN tunnel in the same region as the subnetwork used by the client VMs.
For example, suppose that VPC1 uses a peering zone that sends queries for
example.com. to VPC2. Suppose also that VPC2 has a private forwarding zone for
example.com. that forwards the queries to an on-premises name server using a
Classic VPN tunnel.
For a VM located in us-east1 in VPC1 to be able to query example.com. , VPC2
must have a VM located in us-east1 . A static route
must also be configured covering the CIDR ranges of the on-premises name servers,
with the next hop configured as the Classic VPN tunnel.
Verify connectivity through Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect
You can use any protocol, such as ping (ICMP), to test connectivity to a
sample VM in your VPC network from on-premises. You must also
attempt to query your on-premises name server directly from a sample
Google Cloud VM by using a tool like dig :
dig DNS_NAME @192.168.x.x # address of the onprem DNS server
Check firewall rules in your VPC network
The implied allow egress firewall
rule allows outbound connections
and established responses from VMs in your VPC network unless
you have created custom rules to deny egress. If you've created custom deny
egress rules, you'll need to create higher priority allow rules that permit
egress to at least your on-premises name servers.
Check on-premises firewall
Make sure that your on-premises firewall is configured to allow incoming traffic
from and outgoing traffic to 35.199.192.0/19 .
Check logs in your on-premises firewall, looking for DNS requests from
35.199.192.0/19 . To use a regex expression to search, use the following:
"35\.199\.(19[2-9]|20[0-9]|21[0-9]|22[0-3]).*"
Check on-premises name server
Verify that you don't have any ACL configured in your on-premises name server
that would block queries from 35.199.192.0/19 .
Check your on-premises name server to see if it is receiving packets from
35.199.192.0/19 . If you have shell access, you can use a tool such as
tcpdump to look for both incoming packets from and outgoing packets to
35.199.192.0/19 :
sudo tcpdump port 53 and tcp -vv
Verify return routes
Your on-premises network must have a route to the 35.199.192.0/19 destination
with the next hop being a VPN tunnel or Interconnect connection for the same
VPC network that sent the DNS request. This behavior is described
in Creating forwarding zones .
If you use multiple VPN tunnels to connect the same VPC network
to your on-premises network, the response does not have to be delivered using
the same tunnel that sent it. However, the response must be delivered by using a
VPN tunnel with a next hop in the same VPC network from which
the request originated.
If you have connected more than one VPC network to your
on-premises network, you must ensure that DNS replies are not sent to the wrong
one. Google Cloud discards DNS responses sent to the wrong
VPC network. For a recommended solution, see our
Best practices
guide.
Outbound forwarding to a name server that uses a non-RFC 1918 IP address fails
By default, Cloud DNS uses standard routing, which
routes queries through the public internet when the target name server has a
non-RFC 1918 IP address. Standard routing doesn't support forwarding queries
to name servers with non-RFC 1918 addresses that are not reachable from the
public internet.
To forward queries to a name server that uses a
non-RFC 1918 IP address through your VPC network, configure
the Cloud DNS forwarding zone or server policy to use private routing
for the target name server.
For an explanation of the differences between standard and private routing, see
forwarding targets and routing methods .
This limitation applies even if there is a VPC route for the
target name server; routes for non-RFC 1918 addresses have no effect on
Cloud DNS's outbound forwarding behavior when standard routing is
configured.
Outbound forwarding to a secondary NIC fails
Make sure that you have set up your secondary network interface controller (NIC)
correctly.
For instructions about how to set up additional NICs, see Creating virtual
machine instances with multiple network
interfaces .
Outbound forwarded queries receive SERVFAIL errors
If Cloud DNS receives an error from all target name servers or does not
receive a response from any of the target name servers, it returns a SERVFAIL
error.
To resolve this issue, verify that your on-premises name servers are properly
configured. Then, verify that your on-premises name servers respond to queries
from the Cloud DNS address range described in Open Google Cloud
and on-premises firewalls to allow DNS
traffic
within 4 seconds. If your on-premises name servers consult upstream name servers
(for example, due to being configured as caching resolvers), check that there
are no issues with upstream name servers.
Additionally, if the forwarding target is an on-premises system, be aware
that the routes configured for that path can be custom dynamic routes or custom
static routes, with the important exception that custom static routes with
network tags are not valid for forwarding DNS queries . Ensure that the route
used to reach the on-premises name server does not specify a network tag.
Resource records
This section provides troubleshooting tips for resource records.
Unexpected data when querying for resource record sets present in the zone
There are several reasons why you might receive unexpected data when querying for
resource record sets present in a Cloud DNS managed zone:
Resource record sets created by using the @ syntax specified in
RFC 1035
are not supported. Cloud DNS interprets the @ symbol in such
resource record sets literally; therefore, in the example.com. zone, a
record set created for the QNAME @ is interpreted as @.example.com.
instead of example.com. . To resolve this issue, ensure that you create
record sets without the @ symbol; all names are relative to the apex of the
zone.
Like all records, wildcard CNAME records are subject to the
existence rules described in
RFC 4592 . For example,
suppose that you define the following record sets in the example.com.
zone:
*.images.example.com. IN CNAME _static.example.com.
srv1.images.example.com. IN A 192.0.2.91
_static.example.com. IN A 192.0.2.92
A query for public.srv1.images.example.com. returns NOERROR with an
empty answer section. The existence of a record between the CNAME and the
QNAME prevents the CNAME from being returned, but there's no record that
matches the QNAME exactly, so Cloud DNS returns an empty answer.
This is standard DNS behavior.
Google Cloud VM shows incorrect pointer (PTR) records
When a VM is migrated during a maintenance event, the PTR record logic doesn't
handle some edge cases correctly and reverts the DNS PTR records to the
googleusercontent.com fully qualified domain name (FQDN). To restore
functionality, apply the PTR record again.
For details about how to apply PTR records on a VM, see Creating a PTR record
for a VM instance .
Cloud DNS resource record sets returned in random order
Consistent with DNS industry practices, Cloud DNS name
servers now randomize the order of the resource record sets and ignore the
ordering given by the authoritative server. This is normal DNS behavior and
applies to both public and
private Cloud DNS zones.
Unsupported zonal resource type
When you enter the --location flag to a gcloud command or API request for
a feature that targets a different Cloud DNS zone, the request is
rejected. For example, if you send a zonal-only feature request to a global
server, or a global-only feature request to a zonal server, the server rejects
the request and gives an _UNSUPPORTED_ZONAL_RESOURCE TYPE error.
For a list of resources and features that zonal Cloud DNS supports, see zonal
Cloud DNS support .
Advanced threat detection
This section provides information about issues that you might encounter when
using DNS Armor and provides suggestions for how to fix each of them.
Metrics show no or very low DNS queries being sent to the threat detector
First, verify that you have a DNS threat detector.
Verify your DNS threat detector
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Advanced threat detection page.
Go to Advanced threat detection
Verify that you have a threat detector listed.
Verify region support
Make sure that Locations contains the
region serving your workflow's DNS queries.
Verify that you have internet-bound queries
Query logs are only sent when internet-bound queries or requests are made of your network.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Monitoring page.
Go to Monitoring
In Metric select Cloud DNS Query , then choose Query and DNS response counts .
View the metrics for target types that are internet-bound.
Alternatively, if you have enabled Cloud logging for DNS queries, use the
Logs Explorer to verify that you have internet-bound queries.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Logs Explorer page.
Go to Logs Explorer
View your DNS logs and check for internet-bound queries.
Threat event logs aren't returned
If threat events aren't received by Cloud Logging, first verify that an advanced threat detector is set up on the Dashboard . Note that threat event logs are only returned when a threat is detected.
Verify threat detection is enabled
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Advanced threat detection page.
Go to Advanced threat detection
Verify that you have a threat detector listed.
DNS threats events aren't generated for some abusive or bad domains
Some DNS threat events for abusive or bad domains might not be generated
for domains obtained from public bad domain lists on the Internet as DNS threat
domains change frequently. Old or expired domains from those lists don't
generate DNS threat events.
The following are test domains you can use to verify DNS threat domains:
dnst-gcp-blox.com
ftags-gcp-blox.com
dga-gcp-blox.com
Verify that DNS threat events are generated for test domains
Sign in to a VM that is part of project you're monitoring.
Open a terminal and issue a dig command for one of the test domains.
domain= TEST_DOMAIN
dig $domain -t A
Replace TEST_DOMAIN with one of the listed domains.
Open the Google Cloud console, go to the Logs Explorer page.
Go to Logs Explorer
Run the following query:
resource.type="networksecurity.googleapis.com/DnsThreatDetector"
Search for the test domain you used in the dig command.
These domains generate DNS threat events. If you can't find DNS logs for the
listed domains, contact Support .
