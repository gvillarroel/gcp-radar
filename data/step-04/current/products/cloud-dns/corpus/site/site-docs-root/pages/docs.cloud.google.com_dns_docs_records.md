roles/dns.admin
Before you begin
You must have or create a managed zone before you can create a resource record
set. For details about how to create a managed zone, in which you can create
your resource record set, see
Create a managed zone .
Add a resource record set
To add a resource record set, follow these steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud DNS zones page.
Go to Cloud DNS zones
Click the name of the managed zone that you want to add the record to.
On the Zone details page, click Add standard .
On the Create record set page, in the DNS name field, enter
the subdomain of the DNS zone—for example, mail . The trailing
dot is automatically added at the end.
To create a wildcard DNS record, enter an asterisk—for example,
*.example.com .
The at sign (@) does not automatically create an apex record.
To create a resource record at the domain apex, leave the DNS name
field blank.
Select the Resource record type —for example, MX .
In the TTL field, enter a numeric value for the resource record's
time to live, which is the amount of time that it can be cached. This
value must be a positive integer.
From the TTL unit menu, select the unit of time—for example,
minutes .
Depending on the resource record type that you have selected,
populate the remaining fields .
To enter additional information, click Add item .
Click Create .
gcloud
To add a resource record set, use the
gcloud dns record-sets create command :
gcloud dns record-sets create RRSET_NAME \
--rrdatas= RR_DATA \
--ttl= TTL \
--type= RRSET_TYPE \
--zone= MANAGED_ZONE
Replace the following:
RRSET_NAME : the DNS name that matches the incoming
queries with this zone's DNS name as its suffix—for example,
test.example.com
RR_DATA : an arbitrary value associated with the resource
record set—for example, 198.51.100.5 ; you can also enter multiple
values, rrdata1 rrdata2 rrdata3 —for example, 198.51.100.5
10.2.3.4 ...
TTL : the TTL in seconds that the resolver caches this
resource record set—for example, 30
RRSET_TYPE : the resource record type
of this resource record set—for example, A .
MANAGED_ZONE : the managed zone that this
resource record set is affiliated with—for example, my-zone-name ;
the name of this resource record set must have the DNS name of the
managed zone as its suffix
API
To add a resource record set, use the
resourceRecordSets.create method
method:
POST https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /managedZones/ MANAGED_ZONE /rrsets
{
"name": " RRSET_NAME ",
"type": " RRSET_TYPE ",
"ttl": TTL ,
"rrdatas": [ RR_DATA ]
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project
MANAGED_ZONE : the managed zone that this
resource record set is affiliated with—for example, my-zone-name ;
the name of this resource record set must have the DNS name of the
managed zone as its suffix
RRSET_NAME : the DNS name that matches the incoming
queries with this zone's DNS name as its suffix—for example,
test.example.com
RRSET_TYPE : the resource record type
of this resource record set—for example, A
TTL : the TTL in seconds that the resolver caches this
resource record set—for example, 30
RR_DATA : an arbitrary value associated with the resource
record set—for example, "198.51.100.5" ; you can also enter
multiple values in a comma-separated list—for example,
"198.51.100.5","10.2.3.4" .
Terraform
resource "google_dns_managed_zone" "parent_zone" {
name = "sample-zone"
dns_name = "sample-zone.hashicorptest.com."
description = "Test Description"
}
resource "google_dns_record_set" "default" {
managed_zone = google_dns_managed_zone.parent_zone.name
name = "test-record.sample-zone.hashicorptest.com."
type = "A"
rrdatas = ["10.0.0.1", "10.1.0.1"]
ttl = 86400
}
Add a collection of resource record sets in a transaction
You can add multiple resource record sets by creating a transaction that
specifies the changes. A transaction is a group of one or more DNS record
changes that must be applied as a unit. The entire transaction either succeeds
or fails, ensuring your data is never left in an inconsistent state. You can
create a transaction only by using the gcloud CLI or the
Cloud DNS API.
To create a transaction, follow these steps:
gcloud
To start a transaction, use the
gcloud dns record-sets transaction start command :
gcloud dns record-sets transaction start \
--zone= MANAGED_ZONE
Replace MANAGED_ZONE with the name of the managed
zone whose resource record sets you want to manage—for example,
my-zone-name .
To add a resource record set as part of a transaction, use the
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add command :
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add RR_DATA \
--name= DNS_NAME \
--ttl= TTL \
--type= RECORD_TYPE \
--zone= MANAGED_ZONE
Replace the following:
RR_DATA : an arbitrary value associated with the
resource record set—for example, 198.51.100.5 ; you can also
enter multiple values, rrdata1 rrdata2 rrdata3 —for
example, 198.51.100.5 10.2.3.4 ...
DNS_NAME : the DNS or domain name of the record set
to add—for example, test.example.com
TTL : the time to live (TTL) for the record set in number
of seconds—for example, 300
RECORD_TYPE : the record type —for
example, A .
MANAGED_ZONE : the name of the managed zone whose
resource record sets you want to manage—for example, my-zone-name
To execute the transaction, use the
gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute command :
gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute \
--zone= MANAGED_ZONE
To add a wildcard transaction, use the
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add command :
gcloud dns record-sets transaction add \
--zone= MANAGED_ZONE \
--name= WILDCARD_DNS_NAME \
--type= RECORD_TYPE \
--ttl= TTL
Replace the following:
MANAGED_ZONE : the name of the managed zone whose
resource record sets you want to manage—for example, my-zone-name
WILDCARD_DNS_NAME : the DNS or domain name of the
resource record set that you want to add—for example, *.example.com.
(note the trailing dot)
RECORD_TYPE : the record type —for
example, CNAME .
TTL : the TTL for the record set in number
of seconds—for example, 300
API
To create a transaction with new resource record sets, use the
changes.create method :
POST https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /managedZones/ MANAGED_ZONE /changes
{
"deletions": []
"additions": [
{
"name": DNS_NAME ,
"type": RECORD_TYPE ,
"ttl": TTL ,
"rrdatas": [
RR_DATA
]
}
]
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : your project ID
MANAGED_ZONE : your managed zone name or ID
DNS_NAME : the DNS or domain name of the record
set—for example, test.example.com. (note the trailing dot)
RECORD_TYPE : the record type
TTL : the time to live (TTL) for the record set in number of
seconds—for example, 30
RR_DATA : an arbitrary value associated with the resource
record set—for example, 198.51.100.5 ; you can also enter multiple
values, rrdata1 rrdata2 rrdata3 —for example, 198.51.100.5
10.2.3.4 ...
To deliver email to your domain, you must add MX records to your zone. If you
use Google Workspace as your Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) provider, see
the Set up Google Workspace MX
records support page. Otherwise,
use the MX record details from your provider and follow the setup
process described for Google Workspace.
View resource record sets for a zone

On the Zone details page, next to the resource record set that you
want to update, click
edit Edit .
After making the necessary updates, click Save .
Note: You cannot enter conflicting data; for example, if
two records have the same name, they must be of different types. The only
exception is if one of them is a CNAME record, in which case
only the CNAME record can exist.
gcloud
To apply a partial update to an existing resource record set, use the
gcloud dns record-sets update command :
gcloud dns record-sets update RRSET_NAME \

10.2.3.4 ...
Delete resource record sets
When you delete resource record sets, their DNS records are permanently removed;
they cannot be recovered. To prevent losing your DNS records, export the
resource record sets before deletion. For information about how
to export resource record sets, see
Import and export resource record sets .
Cloud DNS public zones
are authoritative, and the name server ( NS ) and start of authority ( SOA )
record types are located at the zone apex, which is the root of that domain.
Cloud DNS automatically creates NS and SOA records at the zone
apex. These records can't be deleted by using the Cloud DNS API
and are automatically deleted when the zone is deleted. For more information,
see RFC 1034 .
To delete resource record sets, follow these steps:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud DNS page.
Go to Cloud DNS zones
Records for the zone are listed on the Zone details page.
To delete resource record sets in a zone, click the name of the zone.
Next to the resource record sets that you want to delete, select the checkbox.
Click Delete record sets .
gcloud
To delete an existing resource record set, use the
gcloud dns record-sets delete command :
gcloud dns record-sets delete RRSET_NAME \
--type= RRSET_TYPE \
--zone= MANAGED_ZONE
Replace the following:
RRSET_NAME : the DNS name that matches the incoming
queries with this zone's DNS name as its suffix—for example,
test.example.com
RRSET_TYPE : the resource record type
of this resource record set—for example, A .
MANAGED_ZONE : the managed zone that this
resource record set is affiliated with—for example, my-zone-name ;
the name of this resource record set must have the DNS name of the
managed zone as its suffix
API
To delete an existing resource record set, use the
resourceRecordSets.delete method :
DELETE https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /managedZones/ MANAGED_ZONE /rrsets/ RRSET_NAME / RRSET_TYPE
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project
MANAGED_ZONE : the managed zone that this
resource record set is affiliated with—for example, my-zone-name ;
the name of this resource record set must have the DNS name of the
managed zone as its suffix
RRSET_NAME : the DNS name that matches the incoming
queries with this zone's DNS name as its suffix—for example,
test.example.com
RRSET_TYPE : the resource record type
of this resource record set—for example, A .
Import and export resource record sets
To copy resource record sets into and out of a managed zone, you can use import and
export commands. You can import from and export to either the BIND zone file
format or the YAML file format.
gcloud
To import a resource record set, use the
dns record-sets import command :
gcloud dns record-sets import -z= ZONE_NAME
If you want to specify the file format of the zone file, use the previous
command with the --zone-file-format flag. If you omit the flag, you must
provide a YAML format zone file.
Replace ZONE_NAME with a new name for your zone.
When you use the gcloud dns record-sets import command with the
--replace-origin-ns flag, it replaces the NS records for the zone with the
NS records specified in the zone file. These records must match the name
servers
assigned by Cloud DNS to host the zone. They must also match
the NS records specified in the parent
(delegating) zone. By default, Cloud DNS does not overwrite NS
records. If you use this flag, you must verify that the NS records are
correct.
When you import record sets as a BIND zone-formatted file, remove the at
sign (@) that denotes the zone's apex. In the BIND zone-formatted file, for
a DNS name like example.com , the at sign (@) refers to example.com. .
However, in Cloud DNS, the at sign (@) is treated literally
when defining record names. To create a resource record set for the
zone's apex in Cloud DNS, use the full domain name—for
example, example.com. .
Caution: Some DNS implementations and providers export BIND zone-formatted files
without trailing dots ( . ) on domain name data in CNAME , MX ,
PTR , and other
records. In zone files, Cloud DNS follows RFC standards and
interprets all domain names without a trailing dot ( . ) as relative to the
DNS name of the zone. Therefore, importing the following MX records into
a zone with the DNS name example.com results in identical
(and probably undesired) records for both:
in.smtp IN MX 5 gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com
in.smtp.example.com. IN MX 5 gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.example.com.
To import your zone files, add a trailing dot ( . ) to the end of
any domain names that must be fully qualified.
To export a resource record set, use the
dns record-sets export command .
To specify that the resource record sets are exported into a BIND
zone-formatted file, use the --zone-file-format flag. For example:
example.com. 21600 IN NS ns-gcp-private.googledomains.com.
example.com. 21600 IN SOA ns-gcp-private.googledomains.com.
cloud-dns-hostmaster.google.com. 1 21600 3600 259200 300
host1.example.com. 300 IN A 192.0.2.91
If you omit the --zone-file-format flag,
export exports the resource record set into a YAML-formatted records file:
gcloud dns record-sets export example.zone -z=examplezonename
For example:
---
kind : dns#resourceRecordSet
name : example.com.
rrdatas :
- ns-gcp-private.googledomains.com.
ttl : 21600
type : NS
---
kind : dns#resourceRecordSet
name : example.com.
rrdatas :
- ns-gcp-private.googledomains.com. cloud-dns-hostmaster.google.com. 1 21600 3600 259200 300
ttl : 21600
type : SOA
---
kind : dns#resourceRecordSet
name : host1.example.com.
rrdatas :
- 192.0.2.91
ttl : 300
type : A
Cloud DNS supports the ALIAS record type, which isn't a standard DNS
record type and isn't supported in BIND . If you're exporting resource record
sets to BIND , ALIAS records are skipped. If a zone has a routing policy,
it is exported as a record with empty resource record data (rrdata).
