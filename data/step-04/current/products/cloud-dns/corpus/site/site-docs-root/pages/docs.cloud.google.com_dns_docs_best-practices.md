This document provides best practices for private zones, DNS forwarding, and
reference architectures for hybrid DNS.
It's easier for both humans and applications to use the Domain Name System (DNS)
to address applications and services because using a name is easier to
remember and more flexible than using IP addresses. In a hybrid environment that
consists of on-premises and one or more cloud platforms, DNS records for
internal resources often need to be accessed across environments. Traditionally,
on-premises DNS records are manually administered by using an authoritative DNS
server, such as BIND in UNIX/Linux environments or Active Directory in
Microsoft Windows environments.
This document describes best practices for forwarding private DNS requests
between environments to make sure that services can be addressed from both
on-premises environments and within Google Cloud.
General principles
Learn about DNS concepts on Google Cloud
When you use DNS on Google Cloud, it's important to understand the
different systems and services available in Google Cloud for DNS
resolution and domain names:
Internal DNS is a service that automatically
creates DNS names for virtual machines and internal load balancers on
Compute Engine .
Cloud DNS is a service providing low latency and
high availability DNS zone serving. It can act as an authoritative DNS server
for public zones that are visible to the internet, or for private zones that
are visible only within your network.
Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory is a
highly available, hardened service that runs Microsoft Active Directory,
including a domain controller.
Public DNS is a Google
service that is not part of Google Cloud that acts as an open,
recursive DNS resolver.
Cloud Domains is a domain registrar for buying,
transferring, and managing domains within Google Cloud.
Cloud Domains lets you interact with the domain registration
system through an API.
Identify stakeholders, tools, and processes
When you think about building a strategy for DNS in a hybrid environment, it's
important to familiarize yourself with your current architecture and
contact all stakeholders. Do the following:
Identify and contact the administrator of your organization's corporate DNS
servers. Ask them for information about the configurations that are required
to map your on-premises configuration to a suitable architecture on
Google Cloud. For information about methods for accessing
Google Cloud DNS records, see
Use conditional forwarding for accessing DNS records from on-premises .
Familiarize yourself with the current DNS software and identify the domain
names that are used privately within your organization.
Identify contacts on the networking team who can make sure that traffic to
Cloud DNS servers is correctly routed.
Familiarize yourself with your hybrid connectivity strategy and with hybrid
and multicloud patterns and practices.
Create a consistent naming standard
Create a naming standard that is consistent throughout your organization.
For example, assume that your organization uses example.com
as its second-level domain name and the domain for public resources (for example,
www.example.com ). Where the public zones are hosted is irrelevant for the
purposes of this document because the scope is to migrate private zones.
For naming corporate resources on-premises, you can choose from the following
patterns:
You can have different domain names for on-premises servers and for
Google Cloud.
This pattern uses a separate domain for your different environments—for example,
corp.example.com for your on-premises servers and gcp.example.com for all
resources on Google Cloud. If you use other public cloud environments,
they can each have a separate subdomain. This is the preferred pattern,
because you can forward requests between environments.
You can also use separate domain names such as example.com and
example.cloud .
You can have the Google Cloud domain as a subdomain of the domain that
contains on-premises servers. Using the example.com domain, on-premises
could use corp.example.com , and Google Cloud could use
gcp.corp.example.com . This is a common pattern when most of the resources
remain on-premises.
You can have the on-premises domain as a subdomain of the domain that contains
Google Cloud records. Using the example.com domain, Google Cloud
could use corp.example.com and on-premises could use dc.corp.example.com .
This is an uncommon pattern, but it might be used for digital
organizations that have only a small footprint on-premises.
You can use the same domain for Google Cloud and for on-premises.
In this case, both Google Cloud and on-premises use resources that use
the corp.example.com domain. Avoid this pattern because it makes
managing records in a hybrid environment much harder; it's possible only when
you use a single authoritative DNS system.
The rest of this page uses the following domain names:
example.com as a domain name for your public records, regardless of where
they're hosted.
corp.example.com as a zone hosted by your on-premises DNS server. This zone
hosts records of your on-premises resources.
gcp.example.com as a Cloud DNS private managed zone that hosts
records for your Google Cloud resources.
Figure 1 illustrates a domain name setup that is consistent across both your
on-premises network and Google Cloud.
Figure 1. Domain name setup is consistent across the organization.
For naming resources within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, you can
follow guidelines such as the ones in the solutions guide
Best practices and reference architectures for VPC design .
Choose where DNS resolution is performed
In a hybrid environment, DNS resolution can be performed in different locations.
You can do the following:
Use a hybrid approach with two authoritative DNS systems.
Keep DNS resolution on-premises.
Move all DNS resolution to Cloud DNS.
We recommend the hybrid approach, so this document focuses on that approach.
However, for completeness, this document briefly describes the alternative
approaches.
Use a hybrid approach with two authoritative DNS systems
We recommend using a hybrid approach with two authoritative DNS systems.
In this approach:
Authoritative DNS resolution for your private Google Cloud environment
is done by Cloud DNS.
Authoritative DNS resolution for on-premises resources is hosted by existing
DNS servers on-premises.
Figure 2 shows this arrangement.
Figure 2. A hybrid DNS architecture that uses both
Cloud DNS and on-premises DNS servers provides authoritative
DNS resolution.
The scenario shown in figure 2 is the preferred use case. The following details
are covered later on this page:
How to set up forwarding between environments using private zones and DNS
forwarding.
How to configure firewalls and routing.
Reference architectures that show how to use one or multiple
VPC networks.
Keep DNS resolution on-premises
An alternative approach is to continue using your existing on-premises DNS
server for authoritatively hosting all internal domain names. In that case, you
can use an alternative name server to forward all requests from
Google Cloud through outbound DNS forwarding.
This approach has the following advantages:
You make fewer changes in business processes.
You can continue to use your existing tools.
You can use deny lists to filter individual DNS requests on-premises.
However, it has the following disadvantages:
DNS requests from Google Cloud have higher latency.
Your system relies on connectivity to on-premises environments for DNS
operations.
You might find it difficult to integrate highly flexible environments such as
autoscaled instance groups.
The system might not be compatible with products such as Managed Service for Apache Spark
because those products rely on reverse resolution of Google Cloud
instance names.
Move all DNS resolution to Cloud DNS
Another approach is to migrate to Cloud DNS as an authoritative service
for all domain resolution. You can then use private zones and inbound DNS
forwarding to migrate your existing on-premises
name resolution to Cloud DNS.
This approach has the following advantages:
You don't need to maintain a high availability DNS service on-premises.
Your system can use Cloud DNS to take advantage of centralized
logging and monitoring .
However, it has the following disadvantages:
DNS requests from on-premises have higher latency.
Your system requires a reliable connection to your VPC network
for name resolution.
Best practices for Cloud DNS private zones
Private zones host DNS records that are visible only inside your organization.
Public zones on Cloud DNS are not covered in this document. Public
zones cover the organization's public records, such as DNS records for the
public website, and they're not as relevant in a hybrid setup.
Use automation to manage private zones in the Shared VPC host project
If you use Shared VPC networks within your organization, you must host
all the private zones on Cloud DNS within the host project. All service
projects automatically can access the records in private zones attached to the
Shared VPC network. Alternatively, you can set up the zone in a service
project using cross-project binding .
Figure 3 shows how private zones are hosted in a Shared VPC network.
Figure 3. This setup shows how private zones are
attached to a Shared VPC.
If you want teams to set their own DNS records, we recommend that you automate
DNS record creation. For example, you can create a web application or an
internal API where users set their own DNS records under specific subdomains.
The app verifies that the records comply with your organization rules.
Alternatively, you can put your DNS configuration in a code repository such as
Cloud Source Repositories in the form of
Terraform
or Cloud Deployment Manager
descriptors and accept pull requests from teams.
In both cases, a service account with the IAM
DNS Administrator role
in the host project can automatically deploy the changes after they've been
approved.
Set IAM roles using the principle of least privilege
Use the security principle of least
privilege to give the
right to change DNS records only to those in your organization who need to
perform this task. Avoid using basic
roles because they might give access to
resources beyond those that the user requires. Cloud DNS offers roles
and permissions that allow you
to give read and write access that is specific to DNS.
If it's important to separate the ability to create private DNS zones from the
ability to create public zones, use the dns.networks.bindPrivateDNSZone
permission.
Best practices for DNS forwarding zones and server policies
Cloud DNS offers
DNS forwarding zones and
DNS server policies to allow lookups
of DNS names between your on-premises and Google Cloud environment. You
have multiple options for configuring DNS forwarding. The following section
lists best practices for hybrid DNS setup. These best practices are illustrated
in the
Reference architectures for hybrid DNS .
Note: DNS forwarding cannot be used to forward between different Google Cloud
environments, regardless of which way they are interconnected. For that use case,
use DNS peering .
Use forwarding zones to query on-premises servers
To make sure that you can query DNS records in your on-premises environment, set up a
forwarding zone for the domain that you're using on-premises for your corporate
resources (such as corp.example.com ). This approach is preferred over using a
DNS policy that enables an alternative name server .
It preserves access to Compute Engine internal DNS names,
and external IP addresses are still resolved without an extra hop through an
on-premises name server.
The traffic flow that uses this setup is shown in the
Reference architectures for hybrid DNS .
Use alternative name servers only if all DNS traffic needs to be
monitored or filtered on-premises, and if
private DNS logging can't meet your requirements.
Note: Cloud DNS does not automatically synchronize with on-premises name
servers. On-premises name servers must be available to respond to
outbound-forwarded queries. As described in
DNS forwarding zones ,
Cloud DNS caches results of outbound-forwarded queries for up
to 60 seconds, or for the duration of their TTL. Google Cloud does not
sync or cache on-premises records; requests are forwarded as they come in.
Therefore it's critical for on-premises DNS servers to be available and
reachable so that on-premises domains can be resolved.
Use DNS server policies to allow queries from on-premises
To allow on-premises hosts to query DNS records that are hosted in
Cloud DNS private zones (for example, gcp.example.com ), create a DNS
server policy using inbound DNS forwarding .
Inbound DNS forwarding allows your system to query all private zones in the
project as well as internal DNS IP addresses and peered zones.
The traffic flow that uses this setup is shown in the
Reference architectures for hybrid DNS .
Open Google Cloud and on-premises firewalls to allow DNS traffic
Make sure that DNS traffic is not filtered anywhere inside your
VPC network or on-premises environment by doing the following:
Ensure that your on-premises firewall passes queries from
Cloud DNS. Cloud DNS sends queries from the IP address
range 35.199.192.0/19 . DNS uses UDP port 53 or TCP port 53, depending on
the size of the request or response.
Ensure that your DNS server does not block queries. If your on-premises
DNS server accepts requests only from specific IP addresses, make sure that
the IP address range 35.199.192.0/19 is included.
Ensure that traffic can flow from on-premises to your forwarding IP
addresses. In Cloud Router instances, add a custom advertised
route for the IP address range 35.199.192.0/19 in your VPC
network to the on-premises environment.
Use conditional forwarding for accessing DNS records from on-premises
With Cloud DNS, to access private records hosted on corporate DNS servers
on-premises, you can only use
forwarding zones . However, depending on what DNS server
software you use, you might have multiple options for accessing the DNS records
in Google Cloud from on-premises. In each case, access to the records
happens by using inbound DNS forwarding :
Conditional forwarding . Using conditional forwarding means that your
corporate DNS server forwards requests for specific zones or subdomains to the
forwarding IP addresses on Google Cloud. We recommend this approach
because it is the least complex and lets you centrally monitor all DNS
requests on the corporate DNS servers.
Delegation . If your private zone on Google Cloud is a subdomain of
the zone that you use on-premises, you can also delegate this subdomain to the
Google Cloud name server by setting NS entries within your zone. When
you use this setup, clients can talk to the forwarding IP addresses on
Google Cloud directly, so make sure that the firewall passes these
requests.
Zone transfers . Cloud DNS doesn't support zone transfers, so you
cannot use zone transfers to synchronize DNS records with your on-premises
DNS servers.
Use DNS peering to avoid outbound forwarding from multiple VPC networks
Do not use outbound forwarding to your on-premises DNS servers from
multiple VPC networks because it creates problems with the
return traffic. Google Cloud accepts responses from your DNS servers
only if they're routed to the VPC network from which the query
originated. However, queries from any VPC network have the same
IP address range 35.199.192.0/19 as source. Therefore, responses can't be
routed correctly unless you have separate environments on-premises.
Figure 4. Problem with having multiple VPC
networks doing outbound forwarding.
We recommend that you designate a single VPC network to query
on-premises name servers by using outbound forwarding. Then, additional
VPC networks can query the on-premises name servers by targeting
the designated VPC network with a DNS peering zone. Their queries
would then be forwarded to on-premises name servers according to the
name resolution order of the
designated VPC network. This setup is shown in the
Reference architectures for hybrid DNS .
Understand the difference between DNS peering and VPC Network Peering
VPC Network Peering is not the same as
DNS peering. VPC Network Peering allows virtual machine (VM) instances in
multiple projects to reach each other, but it does not change name resolution.
Resources in each VPC network still follow their own resolution
order.
In contrast, through DNS peering, you can allow requests to be forwarded for
specific zones to another VPC network. This lets you forward
requests to different Google Cloud environments, regardless of whether the
VPC networks are interconnected.
VPC Network Peering and DNS peering are also set up differently.
For VPC Network Peering, both VPC networks need to set up a
peering relationship to the other VPC network. The peering is
then automatically bidirectional.
DNS peering unidirectionally forwards DNS requests and does not require a
bidirectional relationship between VPC networks. A
VPC network referred to as the DNS consumer network performs
lookups for a Cloud DNS peering zone in another VPC
network, which is referred to as the DNS producer network. Users with the
IAM permission dns.networks.targetWithPeeringZone on the
producer network's project can establish DNS peering between consumer and
producer networks. To set up DNS peering from a consumer VPC
network, you require the DNS peer role for the producer VPC
network's host project.
If you use auto-generated names, use DNS peering for internal zones
If you use the auto-generated names for VMs that the internal DNS
service creates, you can use DNS peering to forward the projectname.internal
zones to other projects. As shown in figure 5, you can group all .internal
zones in a hub project to make them accessible from your on-premises network.
Figure 5. DNS peering is used to organize all
.internal zones into a hub.
If you have problems, follow the troubleshooting guide
The Cloud DNS troubleshooting guide
provides instructions for resolving common errors that you might encounter when
you set up Cloud DNS.
Reference architectures for hybrid DNS
This section provides some reference architectures for common scenarios that use
Cloud DNS private zones in a hybrid environment. In each case both
on-premises resources and Google Cloud resources records and zones are
managed within the environment. All records are available for querying both
from on-premises and Google Cloud hosts.
Use the reference architecture that maps to your VPC
network design:
Hybrid architecture using a single Shared VPC network: Uses a
single VPC network connected to or from on-premises
environments.
Hybrid architecture using multiple separate VPC networks:
Connects multiple VPC networks to on-premises environments
through different VPN tunnels or VLAN attachments and shares the same DNS
infrastructure on-premises.
Hybrid architecture using a hub VPC network connected to
spoke VPC networks: Uses VPC Network Peering to have a
hub VPC network connected to multiple independent spoke
VPC networks.
In each case, the on-premises environment is connected to the Google Cloud
VPC networks by one or multiple Cloud VPN tunnels or
Dedicated Interconnect or Partner Interconnect connections.
It is irrelevant which connection method is used to each VPC
network.
Hybrid architecture using a single Shared VPC network
The most common use case is a single Shared VPC network connected to the
on-premises environment as shown in figure 6.
Figure 6. A hybrid architecture uses a single Shared VPC network to connect to an on-premises network.
To set up this architecture:
Set up your on-premises DNS servers as authoritative for corp.example.com .
Configure an authoritative private zone (for example, gcp.example.com ) on
Cloud DNS in the host project of the Shared VPC network,
and set up all records for resources in that zone.
Set a DNS server policy on the host project for the Shared VPC
network to allow inbound DNS forwarding.
Set a DNS forwarding zone that forwards corp.example.com to the on-premises
DNS servers. The Shared VPC network needs to be authorized to query
the forwarding zone.
Set up forwarding to gcp.example.com on your on-premises DNS servers,
pointing at an inbound forwarder IP address in the Shared VPC network.
Make sure that DNS traffic is allowed on your on-premises firewall.
In Cloud Router instances, add a custom advertised route for the range
35.199.192.0/19 to the on-premises environment.
Hybrid architecture using multiple separate VPC networks
Another option for hybrid architectures is to have multiple separate
VPC networks. These VPC networks in your
Google Cloud environment are not connected to each other through
VPC Network Peering. All VPC networks use separate
Cloud VPN tunnels or
VLAN attachments
to connect to your on-premises environments.
As shown in figure 7, a typical use case for this architecture is when you
have separate production and development environments that do not communicate
with each other, but they share DNS servers.
Figure 7. A hybrid architecture can use multiple
separate VPC networks.
To set up this architecture:
Set up your on-premises DNS servers as authoritative for corp.example.com .
Configure a private zone (for example, prod.gcp.example.com ) on
Cloud DNS in the host project of the production Shared VPC
network, and set up all records for resources in that zone.
Configure a private zone (for example, dev.gcp.example.com ) on
Cloud DNS in the host project of the development Shared VPC
network, and set up all records for resources in that zone.
Set a DNS server policy on the host project for the production Shared VPC
network and allow inbound DNS forwarding.
In the production Shared VPC network, set a DNS zone to forward
corp.example.com to the on-premises DNS servers.
Set a DNS peering zone from the development Shared VPC network to the
production Shared VPC network for prod.gcp.example.com .
Set a DNS peering zone from the production Shared VPC network to the
development Shared VPC network for dev.gcp.example.com .
Set up inbound forwarding by delegating the resolution of gcp.example.com.
to the Cloud DNS inbound forwarding virtual IP addresses on your
on-premises name servers.
Make sure that the firewall allows DNS traffic on both on-premises and
Google Cloud firewalls.
In Cloud Router instances, add a custom advertised route for the
IP address range 35.199.192.0/19 in the production Shared VPC
network to the on-premises environment.
Hybrid architecture using a hub VPC network connected to spoke VPC networks
Another option is to use Cloud Interconnect or Cloud VPN to connect
the on-premises infrastructure to a hub VPC network. As
shown in figure 8, you can use VPC Network Peering to peer a
VPC network with several spoke VPC networks.
Each spoke VPC network hosts its own private zones on
Cloud DNS. Custom routes on VPC Network Peering, along with
custom route
advertisement on Cloud Router, allow full route exchange and
connectivity between on-premises and all spoke VPC networks.
DNS peering runs in parallel with VPC Network Peering connections to allow
name resolution between environments.
The following diagram shows this architecture.
Figure 8. A hybrid architecture can use a hub
VPC network connected to spoke VPC networks.
To set up this architecture:
Set up your on-premises DNS servers as authoritative for corp.example.com .
Configure a private zone (for example, projectX.gcp.example.com ) on
Cloud DNS for each spoke VPC network, and set up all
records for resources in that zone.
Set a DNS server policy on the hub project for the hub VPC
network to allow inbound DNS forwarding.
In the hub VPC network, create a private DNS zone for
corp.example.com and configure outbound forwarding to the on-premises DNS
servers.
Set a DNS peering zone from the hub VPC network to each spoke
VPC network for projectX.gcp.example.com .
Set a DNS peering zone from each spoke VPC network to the hub
VPC network for example.com .
Set up forwarding to gcp.example.com on your on-premises DNS servers to
point at an inbound forwarder IP address in the hub VPC network.
Make sure that the firewall allows DNS traffic on both on-premises and
Google Cloud firewalls.
In Cloud Router instances, add a custom advertised route for the
IP address range 35.199.192.0/19 in the hub VPC network to
the on-premises environment.
(Optional) If you also use the automatically generated internal DNS names,
peer each spoke project zone (for example, spoke-project-x.internal ) with
the hub project, and forward all queries for .internal from on-premises.
Note: When you use Cloud VPN instead of VPC Network Peering between
Google Cloud environments with this architecture, make sure that there is
a VM or VPN tunnel in the hub project in every region used in the spoke projects.
This ensures that all VMs can query records through DNS peering.
Multi-provider public DNS using Cloud DNS
As a foundational component of application networking, reliable DNS is key to
ensuring that your applications or services are available for your users. You
can improve the availability and resiliency of your applications and services by
configuring multiple DNS providers. When multiple DNS providers are configured,
your application or service can be available to your users even if there is an
outage with one of the DNS providers. You can also simplify the deployment and
migration of hybrid applications that have dependencies across on-premises and
cloud environments with a multi-provider DNS configuration.
Google Cloud offers an open source solution based on
octoDNS to help you set up and
operate an environment with multiple DNS providers. The multi-provider DNS
solution leverages Cloud DNS as one of your DNS providers in an
active-active (recommended) or active-passive configuration to ensure a highly
available DNS architecture. After you have deployed the solution, octoDNS
performs one-time as well as ongoing sync between your current DNS zones and
managed DNS zones hosted in Cloud DNS. When individual DNS records are
updated, the changes are propagated to corresponding DNS zones hosted in
Cloud DNS without requiring any changes to your CI/CD pipelines.
Important: To achieve active-active configuration and reliability, you must
update the NS records at your registrar to include Cloud DNS
name servers.
