About supported file system protocols
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Filestore supports the following file system protocols:
NFSv3
Available in all service tiers.
Supports bidirectional communication between the client and server.
Uses multiple ports.
Creates a trust channel for network traffic and operations.
Offers quick setup for standard POSIX access.
NFSv4.1
Available in zonal, regional, and
enterprise service tiers .
Supported by Filestore CSI driver to create zonal or enterprise instances and mount them with NFSv4.1 semantics.
Compatible with modern firewall configurations and supports network security
compliance requirements.
Communication is always initiated by the client and always served through
a single server port, 2049 .
Supports client and server authentication.
Requires RPCSEC_GSS Authentication
which is implemented using LDAP
and Kerberos ,
both available in Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory .
Supports LDAP and Kerberos for authentication ( krb5 ), message
integrity checks ( krb5i ), and in-transit data encryption ( krb5p ).
Offers NFSv4.1 file ACL support for the client and server.
Each protocol is best suited to specific use cases. The following table compares
the specifications of each protocol:

NFSv3 benefits
The NFSv3 protocol offers quick setup for standard POSIX access.
NFSv3 limitations
The Private Service Connect capability is in the Restricted GA launch stage, which means it requires additional access. To request access, contact your Google Cloud account representative. For more information, see Create a Filestore instance that uses Private Service Connect .
The following is a list of NFSv3 limitations:
Lacks client and server authentication and encryption.
Lacks client failure handling.
For NFSv3 instances that use Private Service Connect NFS file locking is subject to the following limitations:
Clients waiting on blocking locks won't receive notifications when locks become available.
Locks on rebooted clients are cleared automatically only upon detecting subsequent NLM activity from these clients.
Benefits of NFSv4.1
The NFSv4.1 protocol uses the RPCSEC_GSS Authentication
method, which is implemented using LDAP
and Kerberos to provide client
and server authentication, message integrity checks, and in-transit data
encryption.
These security capabilities make the NFSv4.1 protocol compatible with modern
network security compliance requirements:
Uses a single server port, 2049 , for all communication, helping simplify
firewall configurations.
Supports NFSv4.1 file access control lists (ACLs).
Each ACL supports up to 50 access control entries (ACEs) per file or
directory. This includes inheritance records.
Unlimited groups support when using Managed Microsoft AD integration.
Supports better client failure handling with lease-based advisory locking.
The client must verify continued connection with the server. If the client
doesn't renew the lease, the server releases the lock and the file becomes
available to any other client requesting access through a lock lease.
In NFSv3, if a client is deleted while under lock, the file can't be
accessed by another client, such as a new GKE node.
Supports stateful recovery.
Unlike NFSv3, NFSv4.1 is a TCP- and connection-based stateful protocol.
The state of the client and server in the previous session can be resumed
after recovery.
Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory
While Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory (Managed Microsoft AD)
is not a strict requirement, it is the only Google Cloud-managed solution to
support both LDAP and Kerberos, both of which are requirements for the
Filestore NFSv4.1 protocol.
Administrators are strongly encouraged to use
Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory (Managed Microsoft AD)
to implement and manage LDAP and Kerberos.
As a Google Cloud-managed solution, Managed Microsoft AD provides the
following benefits:
Offers multiregion deployment, supporting up to five regions on the same domain.
Reduces latency by ensuring users and their respective login servers are in
closer proximity.
Supports POSIX RFC 2307 and
RFC 2307bis ,
requirements for NFSv4.1 implementation.
Automates unique identifier (UID) and globally unique identifier (GUID) user
mapping.
Users and groups can be created in or migrated to Managed Microsoft AD.
Administrators can create a domain trust with the current on-premises,
self-managed, Active Directory (AD) and LDAP domain. With this option,
migration is not necessary.
Provides an SLA.
Access control and additional behaviors
Filestore NFSv4.1 ACEs are managed on Linux using the following
commands:
nfs4_setfacl : Create or
edit ACEs on a file or directory.
nfs4_getfacl : List the
ACEs on a file or directory.
Each ACL supports up to 50 ACEs. Six entries are reserved for autogenerated
ACEs created by client chmod operations. These ACEs can be modified after
creation.
The autogenerated ACE records representing the mode bits are listed in the
following order of priority:
DENY and ALLOW ACEs for the OWNER@
DENY and ALLOW ACEs for the GROUP@
DENY and ALLOW ACEs for EVERYONE@
If such ACEs are already present, they will be re-used and modified
according to the new applied mode bits.
Filestore NFSv4.1 supports checking the required access only in
POSIX mode RWX (read, write, and execute). It won't differentiate between
write append and write operations that modify the content or SETATTR
specification. The nfs4_setfacl utility also accepts RWX as a shortcut and
automatically turns on all the appropriate flags.
The nfs4_getfacl doesn't do any translation of the principal on its own. The
nfs4_getfacl utility will show the numeric UID and GUID for the
principals. As a result, the special principals of OWNER@ , GROUP@ , and
EVERYONE@ will be shown.
Regardless of whether using Managed Microsoft AD, when working with
AUTH-SYS and the nfs4_setfacl utility, administrators must specify the
numeric UID and GUID , not user names. This utility isn't able to
translate names to these values. If not provided correctly, the
Filestore instance will default to the nobody ID.
When specifying write permissions for a file, or even files affected by
an inherited ACE, the ACE must include both the w (write) and a (append)
flags.
When checking permissions for SETATTR , the returned response is similar to
POSIX in the following way:
The superuser or ROOT user can do anything.
Only the file owner can set the mode bits, ACLs, and time stamps to a
specific time and group, such as one of the GUID s it belongs to.
Users other than the file owner may view the attributes, including the ACL.
A single ACE encompasses both effective and inherit-only permissions. Contrary
to other NFSv4.1 implementations, Filestore won't automatically
replicate inherited ACES for the purpose of distinguishing between effective
and inherit-only ACEs.
NFSv4.1 limitations
The NFSv4.1 protocol has the following limitations:
General limitations
When restoring a backup, the new instance must use the same protocol as the source instance.
When using any of the authenticated Kerberos security settings, users can expect some operations latency. Latency increases with each increasing security level.
The NFSv4.1 protocol doesn't support AUDIT and ALARM ACEs.
Data access auditing is not supported.
GKE limitations
The NFSv4.1 protocol can't be combined with Filestore multishares for GKE . This feature is only supported with NFSv3.
For a comprehensive list of supported GKE versions for each Filestore service tier and protocol, see the compatibility table in Access Filestore instances with the Filestore CSI driver .
Managed Microsoft AD limitations
Once configured, don't delete the Managed Microsoft AD domain or the network peering. Doing so causes the Filestore share to become inaccessible.
The only supported authentication mechanism is RPCSEC_GSS, which is implemented using LDAP and Kerberos (both available in Managed Microsoft AD).
To have a Filestore instance join Managed Microsoft AD through a Shared VPC, you must use gcloud or the Filestore API, not the Google Cloud.
The Managed Microsoft AD domain name must not exceed 56 characters.
