Configure firewall rules
Stay organized with collections

This page explains when you must configure firewall rules to enable NFS file
locking.
Conditions that require firewall ingress rule configuration
You must create a firewall ingress rule to enable traffic from
Filestore instances to your clients if:
You are using NFS file locking in the applications accessing the
Filestore instance.
The VPC network you are using has firewall rules that block TCP port 111
or the ports used by the statd or nlockmgr daemons. To determine what
ports the statd and nlockmgr daemons use on the client,
check current port settings .
If the statd and nlockmgr ports aren't set, and you think you might need
to configure firewall rules at any point, we strongly recommend setting those
ports consistently on all client VM instances. For more information, see
Setting NFS ports .
Conditions that require firewall egress rule configuration
You must create a firewall egress rule to enable traffic from your clients to
your Filestore instances if:
The VPC network you're using has a firewall egress rule for the
IP address ranges used by your Filestore instances.
The firewall egress rule blocks traffic to TCP ports 111, 2046, 2049, 2050, or
4045.
You can get the reserved IP address range for any Filestore
instance from
the Filestore instances page
or by running gcloud filestore instances describe . For more information, see
Get information about a specific instance .
For more information about VPC network firewall rules, see
Using Firewall Rules .
Create a firewall ingress rule
Use the following procedure to create a firewall rule to enable traffic from
Filestore instances.
Before you begin, verify the following:
Windows
Confirm that the client is allowed to communicate with the Filestore
instance and that the local firewall is not blocking the required ports.
To open all required NFS ports, run the following command in PowerShell:
'111' , '2046' , '2049' , '2050' , '4045' | % {
C: \W indows \s ystem32 \n etsh.exe advfirewall firewall add rule name = "NFS Shares allow TCP/UDP port $( $_ ) " dir = IN action = ALLOW protocol = TCP,UDP localport = $( $_ )
}
Check current port settings
to determine what ports the statd and nlockmgr daemons use on the
client. Make note of them for later use.
Linux
No prerequisites for completing this task.
MacOS
No prerequisites for completing this task.
Go to the Firewall page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Firewall page
Click Create firewall rule .
Enter a Name for the firewall rule.
This name must be unique for the project.
Specify the Network in which you want to implement the firewall rule.
Specify the Priority of the rule.
If this rule doesn't conflict with any other rules, you can leave the default
of 1000 . If an existing ingress rule has Action on match: Deny set for
the same IP address range, protocols, and ports, then set a lower priority
than the existing ingress rule.
Choose Ingress for Direction of traffic .
Choose Allow for Action on match .
For Targets , take one of the following actions:
If you want to allow traffic to all clients in the network from
Filestore instances, choose All instances in the network .
If you want to allow traffic to specific clients from
Filestore instances, choose Specified target tags . Type
the instance names of the clients in Target tags .
Leave the default value of IP ranges for Source filter .
For Source IP ranges , enter the IP address ranges of the Filestore
instances you want to allow access from in CIDR notation. You can enter the
internal IP address ranges
that you are using with your Filestore instances to enable all
Filestore traffic. You can also enter the IP addresses of
specific Filestore instances.
Leave the default value of None for Second source filter .
For Protocols and ports , choose Specified protocols and ports and
then:
Select the tcp checkbox and enter
111, STATDOPTS , nlm_tcpport
in the associated field, where:
STATDOPTS is the port used by the statd daemon on the
client.
nlm_tcpport is the tcp port used by the nlockmgr daemon
on the client.
Select the udp checkbox and enter the value of nlm_udpport , which
is the udp port used by nlockmgr . Note that these specifications
apply to the following service tiers
only:
Zonal
Regional
Enterprise
Choose Create .
Create a firewall egress rule
Use the following procedure to create a firewall rule to
enable traffic to Filestore instances.
Before you begin, verify the following:
Windows
Confirm that the client is allowed to communicate with the Filestore
instance and that the local firewall is not blocking the required ports.
To open all required NFS ports, run the following command in PowerShell:
'111' , '2046' , '2049' , '2050' , '4045' | % {
C: \W indows \s ystem32 \n etsh.exe advfirewall firewall add rule name = "NFS Shares allow TCP/UDP port $( $_ ) " dir = OUT action = ALLOW protocol = TCP,UDP localport = $( $_ )
}

If you want to allow traffic from specific clients to

the instance names of the clients in Target tags .
For Destination IP ranges , enter the IP address ranges of the Filestore
instances you want to allow access to in CIDR notation. You can enter the
internal IP address ranges
that you are using with your Filestore instances to enable
traffic to all Filestore instances. You can also enter the IP
addresses of specific Filestore instances.
For Protocols and ports , choose Specified protocols and ports . Then
select the tcp checkbox and enter 111,2046,2049,2050,4045 in the
associated field.
Choose Create .
Verify NFS ports
We recommend verifying whether your NFS ports have been opened properly. For
more information, see Configure NFS ports on client VMs .
