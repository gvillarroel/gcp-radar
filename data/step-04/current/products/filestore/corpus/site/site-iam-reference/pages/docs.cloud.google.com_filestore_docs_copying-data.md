Copy data to or from instances
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to copy data from:
Cloud Storage buckets to Filestore file shares
Computers in your environment to Filestore file shares
Filestore file shares to Cloud Storage buckets
We recommend the following options for transferring large volumes of data:
Transfer Appliance : If you're looking to
transfer data to Google Cloud offline or from an area with poor internet
connectivity.
Storage Transfer Service : If you want to transfer
data to Google Cloud from an online data source, such as another cloud
product.
Transfer service for on-premises data : If you want to transfer
data from on-premises to Google Cloud.
Before you begin
To follow these instructions, you must install the
gcloud CLI .
Copy data from a Cloud Storage bucket to a Filestore file share
Note: To transfer less than 1 TB of data, use the gcloud CLI
as described in this section. To transfer more than 1 TB of data,
use Storage Transfer Service . For more
information, see When to use Storage Transfer Service .
To copy data from a Cloud Storage bucket to a Filestore file share
that's mounted on a Compute Engine VM instance, use the
gcloud storage rsync command. This
command works on both Linux and Windows VMs. To copy data on Linux VM instances,
you can also use standard commands like
rsync .
Linux
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page.
Go to the Compute Engine instances page
Choose a Compute Engine VM instance that has the target Filestore
file share mounted and click SSH to open a terminal on that VM instance.
Copy data to the mounted Filestore file share by running the
following command. To recursively synchronize subdirectories of the
location you specify, use the --recursive option with the
gcloud storage rsync command.
gcloud storage rsync gs:// bucket mount-directory
where:
bucket is the Cloud Storage bucket, directory, or
subdirectory to copy data from.
mount-directory is the directory on the client where
the Filestore file share is mounted.
Example
The following command copies data from the data bucket and all
subdirectories to the /mnt/filer directory.
gcloud storage rsync gs://data /mnt/filer --recursive
Windows
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page.
Go to the Compute Engine instances page
Choose a Compute Engine VM instance that has the target Filestore
file share mapped to a drive and click RDP to open a
remote desktop connection to that VM.
Copy data to the mapped Filestore file share by running the
following command. To recursively synchronize subdirectories of the
location you specify, use the --recursive option with the
gcloud storage rsync command.
gcloud storage rsync gs:// bucket mount-directory
where:
bucket is the Cloud Storage bucket, directory, or
subdirectory to copy data from.
mount-directory is the directory on the client where
the Filestore file share is mounted.
Example
The following command copies data from the data bucket and all subdirectories
to the Z: drive that is mapped to the Filestore file share.
gcloud storage rsync gs://data Z:\ --recursive
Copy data from a computer in your environment to a Filestore file share
To copy data from a computer in your environment to a Filestore
file share that is mounted on a Compute Engine Linux VM instance, use
the gcloud compute scp command . The
gcloud compute scp command doesn't work on Windows VM instances.
Use SSH to connect to the computer that contains the data you want to copy.
Check whether you have the gcloud CLI installed by running the following
command:
which gcloud
If the gcloud CLI is installed, the command returns the installation path.
If no installation path is returned, follow the instructions at
Installing gcloud CLI to install it.
Copy data to the mounted Filestore file share:
gcloud compute scp local-data-path client-name :/ mount-directory --project= project-id --zone= zone
where:
local-data-path is the path of a local file or directory that
contains the data you want to copy to the instance. If you want to copy
data from other subdirectories, use the --recurse flag after
local-data-path .
client-name is the name of the Compute Engine VM instance that the
Filestore file share is mounted on.
mount-directory is the directory on the client where
the Filestore file share is mounted.
project-id is the ID of the project that contains the client
VM instance.
If you have set the gcloud default project by using
gcloud config set project project-id ,
you can skip this flag and use the default project instead.
zone is the zone in which the Compute Engine VM instance resides.
If you have set the gcloud default zone by using
gcloud config set compute/zone zone ,
you can skip this flag and use default zone instead.
Example
The following command copies data from the local /etc/acme/data directory
and its subdirectories to the /mnt/filer directory on the nfs-client VM
instance, in the myproject project, in zone us-central1-c :
gcloud compute scp /etc/acme/data --recurse nfs-client:/mnt/filer --project myproject --zone us-central1-c
Copy data from a Filestore file share to a Cloud Storage bucket
You can copy data from a Filestore file share that is mounted on a
Compute Engine VM instance to a Cloud Storage bucket by using the
gcloud storage rsync command.
Before proceeding, first make sure that the Compute Engine VM can write to
Cloud Storage:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page.
Go to the Compute Engine instances page
Choose a Compute Engine VM instance that has the source Filestore
file share mounted.
Check whether the instance has Read Write scope:
Click the instance name to open the instance details page.
Expand Cloud API access scopes and see if Storage has Read
Write scope.
If the Compute Engine VM doesn't have Read Write scope, perform the following steps:
Stop the Compute Engine instance by clicking Stop .
When the instance has stopped, click Edit at the top of the page.
Under Access scopes , select Set access for each API .
Under Storage , select Read Write , and click Save .
When the instance finishes updating, click Start at the top of the page.
To copy data from a Filestore file share to a Cloud Storage
bucket, perform the following:
Linux
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page.
Go to the Compute Engine instances page
Choose a Compute Engine VM instance that has the source Filestore
file share mounted, and then click SSH to open a terminal on that
VM instance.
Copy data from the mounted Filestore file share by running
the following command. To recursively synchronize subdirectories of the
location you specify, use the --recursive option with the
gcloud storage rsync command.
gcloud storage rsync mount-directory gs:// bucket
where:
mount-directory is the directory on the client where
the Filestore file share is mounted.
bucket is the Cloud Storage bucket, directory, or
subdirectory to copy data to.
Example
The following command copies data from the /mnt/filer directory and all
subdirectories to the archive bucket.
gcloud storage rsync /mnt/filer gs://archive --recursive
Windows
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page.
Go to the Compute Engine instances page
Choose a Compute Engine VM instance that has the source Filestore
file share mounted, and then click RDP to open a
remote desktop connection to that VM.
Copy data from the mapped Filestore file share by running
the following command. To recursively synchronize subdirectories of the
location you specify, use the --recursive option with the
gcloud storage rsync command.
gcloud storage rsync mapped-drive gs:// bucket
where:
mapped-drive is the drive on the client to which
the Filestore file share is mapped.
bucket is the Cloud Storage bucket, directory, or
subdirectory to copy data to.
Example
The following command copies data from the mapped drive Z: and all
subdirectories to the archive bucket.
gcloud storage rsync Z:\ gs://archive --recursive
Troubleshooting
Copying data from Cloud Storage to a Filestore instance using the
gcloud CLI can be slow. For detailed information on how to improve
performance, see Improve performance across Google Cloud resources .
