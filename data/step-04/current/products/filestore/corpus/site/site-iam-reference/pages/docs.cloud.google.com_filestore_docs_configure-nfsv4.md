About NFSv4.1 protocol
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The following guide describes the NFSv4.1 protocol.
Filestore offers NFSv4.1 protocol support for instances created in the
following service tiers :
Zonal
Regional
Enterprise
This capability can be integrated with
Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory (Managed Microsoft AD)
to support workloads that require client and server authentication, message data
integrity checks, and in-transit data encryption, capabilities previously
unavailable in Filestore.
Authentication is supported using LDAP
and Kerberos and includes the
following security flavors (settings):
Client and server authentication ( krb5 ).
Message integrity checks ( krb5i ). Includes the capabilities of the
previous setting.
In-transit data encryption ( krb5p ). Includes the capabilities of the
previous setting.
Managed Microsoft AD is the only fully-managed Google Cloud solution that
supports both LDAP
and Kerberos , requirements for
the NFSv4.1 protocol and its security and privacy benefits. While integration
with Managed Microsoft AD is not required, it is highly recommended for an
optimal Google Cloud user experience to manage user accounts and fluctuating
groups and permissions.
Should you use NFSv4.1?
Many enterprise organizations rely on legacy systems for business-critical
operations. Many of these systems require authentication and in-transit
encryption for their network file storage. NFSv3 was not designed with
authentication in mind. Filestore's NFSv4.1 protocol integration with
Managed Microsoft AD now meets this critical user requirement.
For more information on NFSv4.1 benefits, see About supported protocols .
Understanding network-based access control lists (ACLs) in NFSv4.1.
In NFSv3, only the sys security flavor is supported. This setting trusts
the user uid and gid provided by the client during mounting.
In the Filestore NFSv4.1 protocol, several network ACL security flavors
or settings are available:
krb5
Authenticates the client using a Kerberos ticket, which is validated
against the Managed Microsoft AD Kerberos server.
krb5i
Includes the authentication provided by krb5 and also uses Kerberos to run
message integrity checks on all network traffic to and from the instance.
krb5p
Includes the authentication provided by krb5 and message integrity checks
of krb5i and also uses Kerberos for in-transit data encryption.
If you want to take advantage of these options, Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory integration
is required. For more information, see Create a Filestore instance with Managed Microsoft AD .
If a Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory domain isn't specified, only the sys security flavor
is supported.
For more information, see NFSv4.1 limitations .
Mounting Filestore NFSv4.1 instances on Linux clients
The following steps show you how to mount instances on Linux clients.
Mount with sec=sys for standard NFS permissions:
sudo mount -vvvv -t nfs4 -o vers=4.1,sec=sys,rw \ FILESTORE-INSTANCE-FQDN :/ INSTANCE_SHARE_POINT / MOUNT_POINT
Mount with sec=krb5 for Kerberos-based authentication:
sudo mount -vvvv -t nfs4 -o vers=4.1,sec=krb5,rw \ FILESTORE-INSTANCE-FQDN :/ INSTANCE_SHARE_POINT / MOUNT_POINT
Mount with sec=krb5i for Kerberos-based authentication and message integrity
checks:
sudo mount -vvvv -t nfs4 -o vers=4.1,sec=krb5i,rw \ FILESTORE-INSTANCE-FQDN :/ INSTANCE_SHARE_POINT / MOUNT_POINT
Mount with sec=krb5p for Kerberos-based authentication, integrity checks,
and in-transit encryption:
sudo mount -vvvv -t nfs4 -o vers=4.1,sec=krb5p,rw \ FILESTORE-INSTANCE-FQ
DN :/ INSTANCE_SHARE_POINT / MOUNT_POINT
Replace the following:
FILESTORE-INSTANCE-FQDN is the fully-qualified domain name where
the Filestore instance is located.
INSTANCE_SHARE_POINT is the file share name of the Filestore
instance that you want to connect.
MOUNT_POINT is the mount point or directory name where you want
to mount.
Linux client configuration
An NFSv4.1 Filestore instance allows clients to perform NFS operations
using various security flavors. These flavors are configured by the instance
administrator through network ACLs on the Filestore NFSv4.1
instance, during creation or if updated after creation.
The sys security flavor uses standard Unix authentication, while krb5 ,
krb5i , and krb5p flavors use Kerberos-based authentication.
The krb5 , krb5i , and krb5p flavors require the clients to be connected to
the same Managed Microsoft AD domain as the Filestore instance.
Complete the following steps appropriate for your environment.
Ubuntu image
SSH to the Compute Engine instance.
Run the following commands to join the Managed Microsoft AD domain.
Run the following setup command:
sudo apt-get update \
sudo apt-get -y -qq install adcli realmd sssd sssd-tools packagekit krb5-user \ nfs-common expect retry
When prompted for realm, replace the existing entry with the
Managed Microsoft AD domain used on the Filestore
instance. Enter the value in uppercase, then press the arrow
key to select OK , then press Enter .
When prompted for hosts, leave it empty and proceed.
Complete either of the following steps:
For VMs with a hostname length that is less than or equal to 15
characters, run the following command:
sudo realm join -vU JOIN_DOMAIN_USER --automatic-id-mapping=no MANAGED_AD_DOMAIN_NAME
Replace the following:
JOIN_DOMAIN_USER is the name of the user account
used to join the domain.
MANAGED_AD_DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name of the
Managed Microsoft AD service you want to use.
For VMs with a hostname length that is greater than 15 characters,
run the following command:
sudo realm join -vU JOIN_DOMAIN_USER --automatic-id-mapping=no \ --user-principal=host/`hostname -f`@ MANAGED_AD_REALM_NAME MANAGED_AD_DOMAIN_NAME
Replace the following:
JOIN_DOMAIN_USER is the name of the user account
used to join the domain.
MANAGED_AD_REALM_NAME is the realm name of the
Managed Microsoft AD service you want to use.
MANAGED_AD_DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name of the
Managed Microsoft AD service you want to use.
Update Kerberos configuration. Update /etc/krb5.conf with the required
realm definition and realm-domain mapping:
[realms]
DOMAIN_NAME = {
kdc = DOMAIN_NAME
default_domain = DOMAIN_NAME
}
[domain_realm]
. domain_name_lowercase = DOMAIN_NAME
domain_name_lowercase = DOMAIN_NAME
Replace the following:
DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name you want to use, entered
in uppercase.
domain_name_lowercase is the domain name you want to use,
entered in lowercase.
Refer to the following for an example:
[realms]
FILE.DEMO.LOCAL = {
kdc = FILE.DEMO.LOCAL
default_domain = FILE.DEMO.LOCAL
}
[domain_realm]
.file.demo.local = FILE.DEMO.LOCAL
file.demo.local = FILE.DEMO.LOCAL
Run the rpc-gssd service. Add the following No-Strip attribute value
to [General] section inside /etc/idmapd.conf :
[General]
No-Strip = both
Run the following command:
sudo systemctl restart rpc-gssd
Centos image
Ssh to the Compute Engine instance.
Join the Managed Microsoft AD domain:
sudo yum update \
sudo yum install -y adcli realmd sssd samba-common-tools krb5-workstation nfs-utils \ bind-utils openldap-clients
Complete either of the following steps:
For VMs with a hostname length less than or equal to 15 characters, run
the following command:
sudo realm join -vU JOIN_DOMAIN_USER --automatic-id-mapping=no MANAGED_AD_DOMAIN_NAME
Replace the following:
JOIN_DOMAIN_USER is the name of the user account
used to join the domain.
MANAGED_AD_DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name of the
Managed Microsoft AD service you want to use.
For VMs with a hostname length greater than 15 characters, run the
following command:
sudo realm join -vU JOIN_DOMAIN_USER --automatic-id-mapping=no \ --user-principal=host/`hostname -f`@ MANAGED_AD_REALM_NAME MANAGED_AD_DOMAIN_NAME
Replace the following:
JOIN_DOMAIN_USER is the name of the user account
used to join the domain.
MANAGED_AD_REALM_NAME is the realm name of the
Managed Microsoft AD service you want to use.
MANAGED_AD_DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name of the
Managed Microsoft AD service you want to use.
Ensure that sssd service is running:
sudo systemctl status sssd
Run rpc-gssd service. Add the following below the No-Strip attribute
value to the [General] section inside /etc/idmapd.conf :
[General]
No-Strip = both
Run the following command. This command helps ensure the NFS client won't
strip the domain name from the NFS server hostname. For more information,
see NFS Ganesha List Archives
and Arch Linux Archive :
sudo systemctl start rpc-gssd
