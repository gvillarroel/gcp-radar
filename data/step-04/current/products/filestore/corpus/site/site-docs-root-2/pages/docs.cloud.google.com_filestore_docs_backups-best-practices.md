Best practices for creating backups
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The following sections cover recommended best practices.
Preparing your file share for the best backup consistency
The quality of a backup depends on the ability of your application to recover
from backups that are created during heavy write workloads. In most situations,
you can create backups that have good consistency even while your applications
write data to the file share. However, if your applications require strict
consistency, we recommend doing one or more of the following:
Use sync mount. For more information, see "The sync mount option" section
in
nfs(5) .
Alternatively, you can open files with the O_DIRECT|O_SYNC flags. For more
information, see
open(2) .
Pause applications or operating system processes that write data to the file
share and cause them to flush their changes to the file share before
initiating the backup. For more information, see
fsync(2) .
If your applications require consistency between multiple shares, pause all
applications on all instances that are writing to all file shares and create
backups of all file shares before resuming your applications.
If you require application level consistency, stop your applications and
unmount the file share before creating a backup.
Using existing backups as a baseline for new backups to reduce backup creation time
Existing backups of a file share within a region are used as baselines for
creating new backups of the file share, reducing backup creation time. Therefore,
we recommend that you do the following:
Take a new backup of a file share before you delete the previous backup of that
file share.
Wait for new backups to be in the Ready state before creating subsequent
backups of the same file share.
Scheduling backups during off-peak hours to reduce backup creation time
Creating backups during off-peak hours reduces the time that it takes to create
a backup. If you schedule regular backups of your file shares, we recommend
scheduling them during off-peak hours when possible.
Peak hours for backups creation are the end of each business day and midnight in
the region where the Filestore instance is located. We recommend
creating your backups either in the early morning or during the business day.
Organizing your data on separate Filestore instances to maximize efficiency
The more data on the file share, the larger the backup and the more it costs. To
back up only the data that you need to back up, we recommend organizing your data
on separate file shares, namely:
Storing critical data with different write patterns or with different backup
requirements on different file shares.
Reducing the number of backups that you need to create by keeping similar data
in one file share.
