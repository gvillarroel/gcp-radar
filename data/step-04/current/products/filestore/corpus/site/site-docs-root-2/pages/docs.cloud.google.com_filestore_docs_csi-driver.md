Access Filestore instances with the Filestore CSI driver
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Filestore CSI driver is the primary way for you to use Filestore
instances with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
The Filestore CSI driver provides a fully-managed
experience powered by the open source Google Cloud Filestore CSI driver .
The Filestore CSI driver version is tied to Kubernetes minor version numbers. The
Filestore CSI driver version is typically the latest driver available at the time
that the Kubernetes minor version is released. The drivers update automatically
when the cluster is upgraded to the latest GKE
patch.
Note: Because the Filestore CSI driver and some of the other associated CSI
components are deployed as separate containers, they incur resource usage
(VM CPU, memory, and boot disk) on Kubernetes nodes. VM CPU usage is typically
tens of millicores and memory usage is typically tens of MiB. Boot disk usage is
mostly incurred by the logs of the CSI driver and other system containers in the
Deployment. For details about pricing for Autopilot and
Standard clusters, see
Google Kubernetes Engine pricing .
Benefits
The Filestore CSI driver provides the following benefits:
You have access to fully-managed NFS storage through the Kubernetes
APIs ( kubectl ).
You can use the GKE Filestore CSI driver to dynamically
provision your PersistentVolumes.
You can use volume snapshots with the GKE Filestore
CSI driver. CSI volume snapshots
can be used to create Filestore backups .
A Filestore backup creates a differential copy of the file share,
including all file data and metadata, and stores it separate from the instance.
You can restore this copy to a new Filestore instance only. Restoring
to an existing Filestore instance is not supported. You can use the
CSI volume snapshot API to trigger Filestore backups, by adding a
type:backup field in the
volume snapshot class .
You can use
volume expansion
with the GKE Filestore CSI driver. Volume expansion
lets you resize your volume's capacity.
You can access existing Filestore instances by
using pre-provisioned Filestore instances in Kubernetes workloads .
You can also dynamically create or delete Filestore instances and
use them in Kubernetes workloads with a
StorageClass
or a
Deployment .
Supports Filestore multishares for GKE .
This feature lets you create a Filestore instance and allocate
multiple smaller NFS-mounted PersistentVolumes for it simultaneously across
any number of GKE clusters.
Supports Basic HDD tier with a minimum capacity of 100 GiB.
Requirements
To use the Filestore CSI driver, your clusters must meet the following requirements:
The required GKE version depends on the Filestore service tier, and the features you intend to use. See the Supported service tiers, protocols, and GKE versions table for supported combinations.
The Filestore CSI driver is supported for clusters using Linux nodes only. Windows Server nodes are not supported.
The minimum instance size is as at least 100 GiB for Basic HDD tier and at least 1 TiB for Zonal, Regional, and Enterprise service tiers.
To learn more, see Service tiers .

Filestore uses the NFSv3 file system protocol on the Filestore instance by default and supports any NFSv3-compatible client.
Before you begin
Before you start, make sure that you have performed the following tasks:
Enable
the Cloud Filestore API and
the Google Kubernetes Engine API.
Enable APIs
If you want to use the Google Cloud CLI for this task,
install and then
initialize the
gcloud CLI. If you previously installed the gcloud CLI, get the latest
version by running the gcloud components update command. Earlier gcloud CLI versions might not support running the commands in this document.
Note: For existing gcloud CLI
installations, make sure to set the compute/region property . If you use primarily zonal clusters, set the compute/zone instead. By setting a default location,
you can avoid errors in the gcloud CLI like the following:
One of [--zone, --region] must be supplied: Please specify location . You might need to specify the location in certain commands if the location of your cluster differs from the default that you set.
Ensure that you have an existing Autopilot or Standard
cluster. If you need one, create an Autopilot cluster . The Filestore CSI driver is enabled by default for Autopilot clusters.
If you want to use Filestore on a Shared VPC network, see
the additional setup instructions in Use Filestore with Shared VPC .
Enable the Filestore CSI driver on your Standard cluster
Note: The Filestore CSI driver is enabled by default for Autopilot clusters.
To enable the Filestore CSI driver on Standard clusters, use the
Google Cloud CLI or the Google Cloud console.
To enable the driver on an existing Standard cluster, complete the following steps:
gcloud
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--update-addons = GcpFilestoreCsiDriver = ENABLED
Replace CLUSTER_NAME with the name of the existing
cluster.
Console
Go to the Google Kubernetes Engine page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to Google Kubernetes Engine
In the cluster list, click the name of the cluster you want to modify.
Under Features , next to the Filestore CSI driver field, click
edit Edit Filestore CSI driver .
Select the Enable Filestore CSI driver checkbox.
Click Save Changes .
If you want to use Filestore on a Shared VPC network, see
Enable the Filestore CSI driver on a new cluster with Shared VPC .
After you enable the Filestore CSI driver, you can use the driver in Kubernetes
volumes using the driver and provisioner name: filestore.csi.storage.gke.io .
Disable the Filestore CSI driver
You can disable the Filestore CSI driver on an existing Autopilot or
Standard cluster by using the Google Cloud CLI or the Google Cloud console.
Note: We strongly recommend not to manually disable the Filestore CSI driver on
Autopilot clusters. Doing so causes any Pods using PersistentVolumes
owned by the driver to fail to terminate. New pods attempting to use those
PersistentVolumes will also fail to start.
gcloud
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--update-addons = GcpFilestoreCsiDriver = DISABLED \
--region REGION
Replace the following values:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the
existing cluster.
REGION : the region for your cluster
(such as, us-central1 ).
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Google Kubernetes Engine menu.
Go to Google Kubernetes Engine
In the cluster list, click the name of the cluster you want to modify.
Under Features , next to the Filestore CSI driver field, click
edit Edit Filestore CSI driver .
Clear the Enable Filestore CSI driver checkbox.
Click Save Changes .
Access pre-existing Filestore instances using the Filestore CSI driver
This section describes the typical process for using a Kubernetes
volume to access pre-existing Filestore instances using Filestore CSI driver
in GKE:
Create a PersistentVolume and a PersistentVolumeClaim to access the instance
Create a manifest file like the one shown in the following example, and name
it preprov-filestore.yaml :
apiVersion : v1
kind : PersistentVolume
metadata :
name : PV_NAME
spec :
storageClassName : ""
capacity :
storage : 1Ti
accessModes :
- ReadWriteMany
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy : Retain
volumeMode : Filesystem
csi :
driver : filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
volumeHandle : "modeInstance/ FILESTORE_INSTANCE_LOCATION / FILESTORE_INSTANCE_NAME / FILESTORE_SHARE_NAME "
volumeAttributes :
ip : FILESTORE_INSTANCE_IP
volume : FILESTORE_SHARE_NAME
protocol : FILESYSTEM_PROTOCOL
claimRef :
name : PVC_NAME
namespace : NAMESPACE
---
kind : PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion : v1
metadata :
name : PVC_NAME
namespace : NAMESPACE
spec :
accessModes :
- ReadWriteMany
storageClassName : ""
resources :
requests :
storage : 1Ti
To create the PersistentVolumeClaim and PersistentVolume resources based
on the preprov-filestore.yaml manifest file, run the following command:
kubectl apply -f preprov-filestore.yaml
To specify the NFSv4.1 file system protocol, set the protocol field to NFS_V4_1 in the
volumeAttributes field of a PersistentVolume object. To use the NFSv3 file system
protocol, set the protocol field to NFS_V3 or omit the protocol field.
Then, proceed to create a Deployment that consumes the volume .
Create a volume using the Filestore CSI driver
The following sections describe the typical process for using a Kubernetes
volume backed by a Filestore CSI driver in GKE:
Create a StorageClass
Use a PersistentVolumeClaim to access the volume
Create a Deployment that consumes the volume
Create a StorageClass
After you enable the Filestore CSI driver, GKE automatically installs
the following StorageClasses
for provisioning Filestore instances:
zonal-rwx , using the Filestore zonal tier .
enterprise-rwx , using the Filestore enterprise tier ,
where each Kubernetes PersistentVolume maps to a Filestore instance.
enterprise-multishare-rwx , using the Filestore enterprise tier ,
where each Kubernetes PersistentVolume maps to a share of a given Filestore
instance. To learn more, see
Filestore multishares for Google Kubernetes Engine .
standard-rwx , using the
Filestore basic HDD service tier .
premium-rwx , using the
Filestore basic SSD service tier .
Each StorageClass is only available in GKE clusters running in
their respective supported GKE version numbers. For a list of
supported versions required for each service tier, see Requirements .
You can find the name of your installed StorageClass by running the following
command:
kubectl get sc
Note: The pre-installed StorageClasses use volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer . This means that the Filestore instance is not provisioned immediately after creating the PersistentVolumeClaim. The instance is only created when a Pod that references the PersistentVolumeClaim is scheduled.
You can also install a different StorageClass that uses the Filestore CSI driver
by adding filestore.csi.storage.gke.io in the provisioner field.
Filestore needs to know on which network to create the
new instance. The automatically installed StorageClasses use the default
network created for GKE clusters. If you have deleted this
network or want to use a different network, you must create a new StorageClass
as described in the following steps. Otherwise, the automatically installed
StorageClasses won't work.
Save the following manifest as filestore-example-class.yaml :
apiVersion : storage.k8s.io/v1
kind : StorageClass
metadata :
name : filestore-example
provisioner : filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
volumeBindingMode : Immediate
allowVolumeExpansion : true
parameters :
tier : standard
network : default
From the manifest, consider the following parameter configuration:
Setting volumeBindingMode to Immediate allows the provisioning of the
volume to begin immediately. This is possible because Filestore
instances are accessible from any zone. Therefore GKE does
not need to know the zone where the Pod is scheduled, in contrast with
Compute Engine persistent disk. When set to WaitForFirstConsumer ,
GKE begins provisioning only after the Pod is scheduled.
For more information, see
VolumeBindingMode .
Any supported Filestore tier
can be specified in the tier parameter
(for example, BASIC_HDD , BASIC_SSD , ZONAL , or ENTERPRISE ).
The network parameter
can be used when provisioning Filestore instances on non-default
VPCs. Non-default VPCs require special firewall rules
to be set up.
The protocol parameter
can be used to set the file system protocol of the Filestore instance. It can take the following values: NFS_V3 (default) and NFS_V4_1 . The default protocol is NFS_V3 .
To create a StorageClass resource based on the filestore-example-class.yaml
manifest file, run the following command:
kubectl create -f filestore-example-class.yaml
If you want to use Filestore on a Shared VPC network, see
Create a StorageClass when using the Filestore CSI driver with Shared VPC .
Use a PersistentVolumeClaim to access the volume
You can create a PersistentVolumeClaim resource that references the
Filestore CSI driver's StorageClass .
You can use either a pre-installed or custom StorageClass .
The following example manifest file creates a PersistentVolumeClaim that
references the StorageClass named filestore-example .
Save the following manifest file as pvc-example.yaml :
kind : PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion : v1
metadata :
name : podpvc
spec :
accessModes :
- ReadWriteMany
storageClassName : filestore-example
resources :
requests :
storage : 1Ti
To create a PersistentVolumeClaim resource based on the pvc-example.yaml
manifest file, run the following command:
kubectl create -f pvc-example.yaml
Create a Deployment that consumes the volume
The following example Deployment manifest consumes the PersistentVolume
resource named pvc-example.yaml .
Multiple Pods can share the same PersistentVolumeClaim resource.
Save the following manifest as filestore-example-deployment.yaml :
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : Deployment
metadata :
name : web-server-deployment
labels :
app : nginx
spec :
replicas : 3
selector :
matchLabels :
app : nginx
template :
metadata :
labels :
app : nginx
spec :
containers :
- name : nginx
image : nginx
volumeMounts :
- mountPath : /usr/share/nginx/html
name : mypvc
volumes :
- name : mypvc
persistentVolumeClaim :
claimName : podpvc
---
kind : PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion : v1
metadata :
name : podpvc
spec :
accessModes :
- ReadWriteMany
storageClassName : filestore-example
resources :
requests :
storage : 1Ti
To create a Deployment based on the filestore-example-deployment.yaml
manifest file, run the following command:
kubectl apply -f filestore-example-deployment.yaml
Confirm the Deployment was successfully created:
kubectl get deployment
It might take a while for Filestore instances to complete provisioning.
Before that, deployments won't report a READY status. You can check
the progress by monitoring your PVC status by running the following command:
kubectl get pvc
You should see the PVC reach a BOUND status, when the volume
provisioning completes.
Label Filestore instances
You can use labels to group related
instances and store metadata about an instance. A label is a key-value pair that
helps you organize your Filestore instances. You can attach a label to
each resource, then filter the resources based on their labels.
You can provide labels by using the labels key in StorageClass.parameters .
A Filestore instance can be labeled with information about what
PersistentVolumeClaim / PersistentVolume the instance was created
for. Custom label keys and values must comply with the label
naming convention .
See the Kubernetes
storage class example
to apply custom labels to the Filestore instance.
Use NFSv4.1 file system protocol with Filestore
The Filestore CSI driver supports the NFSv4.1 file system protocol with GKE version 1.33 or later.
In case of static provisioning, set the protocol field to NFS_V4_1
in the volumeAttributes field of a PersistentVolume object.
For dynamic provisioning, set the protocol field to NFS_V4_1 in the parameters of a StorageClass object.
apiVersion : storage.k8s.io/v1
kind : StorageClass
metadata :
name : enterprise-multishare-rwx
provisioner : filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
parameters :
tier : enterprise
multishare : "true"
instance-storageclass-label : "enterprise-multishare-rwx"
protocol : NFS_V4_1
volumeBindingMode : WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion : true
You cannot mount the Filestore instance with the NFSv4.1 protocol with mountOptions set to nfsvers=3 in the StorageClass object.
Use fsgroup with Filestore volumes
Kubernetes uses fsGroup to change permissions and ownership of the volume to
match a user-requested fsGroup in the Pod's
SecurityContext .
An fsGroup is a supplemental group that applies to all containers in a Pod.
You can
apply an fsgroup
to volumes provisioned by the Filestore CSI driver.
Configure IP access rules with Filestore volumes
Filestore supports IP-based access control
rules for
volumes. This feature is available on GKE clusters running
version 1.29.5 or later.
This feature allows administrators to specify which IP address ranges are
allowed to access a Filestore instance provisioned dynamically through
GKE. This enhances security by restricting access to only authorized
clients, especially in scenarios where the GKE cluster's IP range is too
broad, potentially exposing the Filestore instance to unauthorized
users or applications.
These rules can be configured directly through the Filestore API, or
through the Filestore CSI driver when a volume is created. You can provide the
selected configuration in JSON format in the StorageClass using the
nfs-export-options-on-create parameter.
The following example manifest shows how to specify the configuration:
apiVersion : storage.k8s.io/v1
kind : StorageClass
metadata :
name : filestore-example
provisioner : filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
volumeBindingMode : Immediate
allowVolumeExpansion : true
parameters :
tier : "enterprise"
nfs-export-options-on-create : '[
{
"accessMode": "READ_WRITE",
"ipRanges": [
"10.0.0.0/24"
],
"squashMode": "ROOT_SQUASH",
"anonUid": "1003",
"anonGid": "1003"
},
{
"accessMode": "READ_WRITE",
"ipRanges": [
"10.0.0.0/28"
],
"squashMode": "NO_ROOT_SQUASH"
}
]'
Note: Use the node primary IP range instead of the Pod IP
in the nfs-export-options-on-create parameter.
Security options
Filestore IP access rules simplify the configuration of shared file storage
permissions for your GKE workloads. However, understanding how it manages
file ownership and access requires grasping a few key concepts:
NFS and user mappings NFS (Network File System) is the protocol used by
Filestore. It works by mapping users on client systems (your GKE
Pods) to users on the Filestore server. If a file on the server is owned by
user ID 1003, and a client connects with user ID 1003, they'll have access
to the file.
Root squashing and anonUid :
Root Squashing ROOT_SQUASH is a security feature that prevents
clients from accessing the Filestore instance with full root privileges.
When root squashing is enabled, root users on client systems are mapped to a
non-privileged user specified by the anonUid setting.
No Root Squashing ( NO_ROOT_SQUASH ) allows clients to access the
Filestore instance with full root privileges, which is convenient for
initial setup but less secure for regular operations.
Initial Setup and Permissions: By default, a new Filestore instance is
owned entirely by the root user. If you enable root squashing without first
setting up permissions for other users, you'll lose access. This is why
you need at least one NFS export rule with NO_ROOT_SQUASH to initially
configure access for other users and groups.
Recommendations
Initial Setup: Always start with at least one NFS export rule that
specifies an administrator range with READ_WRITE permissions and allows
NO_ROOT_SQUASH access. Use this access to create directories, set
permissions, and assign ownership as needed.
Security: Enable root squashing ( ROOT_SQUASH ) to enhance security.
Note that after a volume is created, you can only modify the access rules
through the Filestore API.
Shared Access: Use fsGroup in your Pod security
contexts
to manage group ownership of shared volumes. Make sure not to overlap your
setting with the ROOT_SQUASH mode. Doing so returns an Access denied
error message.
Use Filestore with Shared VPC
This section covers how to use a Filestore instance on a
Shared VPC network from a service project.
Set up a cluster with Shared VPC
To set up your clusters with a Shared VPC network, follow these steps:
Create a host and service project .
Enable the Kubernetes Engine API on both your host and service projects .
In your host project, create a network and a subnet .
Enable Shared VPC in the host project .
On the host project, grant the HostServiceAgent user role binding for the
service project's GKE service account .
Enable private service access on the Shared VPC network .
Enable the Filestore CSI driver on a new cluster with Shared VPC
To enable the Filestore CSI driver on a new cluster with Shared VPC, follow
these steps:
Verify the usable subnets and secondary ranges. When creating a cluster, you
must specify a subnet and the secondary IP address ranges to be used for the
cluster's Pods and Service.
gcloud container subnets list-usable \
--project = SERVICE_PROJECT_ID \
--network-project = HOST_PROJECT_ID
The output is similar to the following:
PROJECT REGION NETWORK SUBNET RANGE
HOST_PROJECT_ID us-central1 shared-net tier-1 10 .0.4.0/22
┌──────────────────────┬───────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐
│ SECONDARY_RANGE_NAME │ IP_CIDR_RANGE │ STATUS │
├──────────────────────┼───────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
│ tier-1-pods │ 10 .4.0.0/14 │ usable for pods or services │
│ tier-1-services │ 10 .0.32.0/20 │ usable for pods or services │
└──────────────────────┴───────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘
Create a GKE cluster. The following examples show how you can
use gcloud CLI to create an Autopilot or Standard
cluster configured for Shared VPC.
The following examples use the network, subnet, and range names from
Creating a network and two subnets .
Autopilot
gcloud container clusters create-auto tier-1-cluster \
--project = SERVICE_PROJECT_ID \
--region = COMPUTE_REGION \
--network = projects/ HOST_PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ NETWORK_NAME \
--subnetwork = projects/ HOST_PROJECT_ID /regions/ COMPUTE_REGION /subnetworks/ SUBNET_NAME \
--cluster-secondary-range-name = tier-1-pods \
--services-secondary-range-name = tier-1-services
Standard
gcloud container clusters create tier-1-cluster \
--project = SERVICE_PROJECT_ID \
--zone = COMPUTE_REGION \
--enable-ip-alias \
--network = projects/ HOST_PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ NETWORK_NAME \
--subnetwork = projects/ HOST_PROJECT_ID /regions/ COMPUTE_REGION /subnetworks/ SUBNET_NAME \
--cluster-secondary-range-name = tier-1-pods \
--services-secondary-range-name = tier-1-services \
--addons = GcpFilestoreCsiDriver
Create firewall rules to allow communication between nodes, Pods, and
Services in your cluster. The following example shows how you can create a
firewall rule named my-shared-net-rule-2 .
gcloud compute firewall-rules create my-shared-net-rule-2 \
--project HOST_PROJECT_ID \
--network = NETWORK_NAME \
--allow = tcp,udp \
--direction = INGRESS \
--source-ranges = 10 .0.4.0/22,10.4.0.0/14,10.0.32.0/20
In the example, the source ranges IP values come from the previous step
where you verified the usable subnets and secondary ranges.
Create a StorageClass when using the Filestore CSI driver with Shared VPC
The following example shows how you can create a StorageClass when using the
Filestore CSI driver with Shared VPC:
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
name: filestore-sharedvpc-example
provisioner: filestore.csi.storage.gke.io
parameters:
network: "projects/ HOST_PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ SHARED_VPC_NAME "
connect-mode: PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS
reserved-ip-range: RESERVED_IP_RANGE_NAME
allowVolumeExpansion: true
EOF
Replace the following:
HOST_PROJECT_ID : the ID or name of the host project of
the Shared VPC network.
SHARED_VPC_NAME : the name of the Shared VPC
network you created earlier.
RESERVED_IP_RANGE_NAME : the name of the specific
reserved IP address range to provision Filestore instance in. This field
is optional. If a reserved IP address range is specified, it must be a named
address range instead of a direct CIDR value.
If you want to provision a volume backed by Filestore multishares on
GKE clusters running version 1.23 or later, see
Optimize storage with Filestore multishares for GKE .
Reconnect Filestore single share volumes
If you are using Filestore with the basic HDD, basic SSD, or enterprise
(single share) tier, you can follow these instructions to reconnect your
existing Filestore instance to your GKE workloads.
Find the details of your pre-provisioned Filestore instance by
following the instructions in Getting information about a specific instance .
Redeploy your PersistentVolume specification. In the volumeAttributes field,
modify the following fields to use the same values as your Filestore
instance from step 1:
ip : Modify this value to the pre-provisioned Filestore instance
IP address.
volume : Modify this value to the pre-provisioned Filestore
instance's share name.
In the claimRef make sure you reference the same PersistentVolumeClaim in
step 2.
Redeploy your PersistentVolumeClaim specification.
Check the binding status of your PersistentVolumeClaim and PersistentVolume
by running kubectl get pvc .
Redeploy your Pod specification and ensure that your Pod is able to access
the Filestore share again.
