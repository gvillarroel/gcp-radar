Edit instances
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to edit a Filestore instance using either the
Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI.
Once created, you can modify a Filestore instance in the following ways:
Increase its capacity
Decrease capacity for the following service tiers :
Zonal
Regional
Enterprise
Configure performance
Change its description
Manage IP-based access control rules
Manage labels
For more information, see Managing labels .
For details on scaling capacity, see Scale capacity .
Certain specifications, such as the instance's IP address, are immutable.
Instructions for editing an instance
Google Cloud console
To edit Filestore instances using the Google Cloud console,
navigate to the Edit instance page, where you can edit the instance
description, manage IP-based access control rules, and scale the file share
performance:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Filestore Instances page.
Go to the Filestore instances page
Click the instance ID of the instance you want to edit.
On the Instance details page, click Edit to go to the Edit
instance page.
Change the instance description, IP-based access control rules, and
capacity as needed. For details, see
Creating instances .
Click Save .
gcloud
Before you begin
To use the gcloud CLI, you must either
install the gcloud CLI
or use the Cloud Shell
that's built into the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Google Cloud console
gcloud command for editing an instance
You can edit a Filestore instance by running the instances
update command. If you
need to update the configuration rules for IP-based access control, you must
use the --flags-file flag and specify a JSON configuration file. If you
choose this method, you don't need to use the --file-share flag because it
is already included in the JSON configuration file.
gcloud filestore instances update INSTANCE_ID
--[project=" PROJECT_ID "]
--[location= LOCATION ]
--[performance= PERFORMANCE ] \
--[file-share=name=" FILE_SHARE_NAME ",CAPACITY= FILE_SHARE_SIZE ]
--[description=" DESCRIPTION "]
--[flags-file= FILE_NAME .json]
where:
INSTANCE_ID is the instance ID of the Filestore
instance you want to edit.
PROJECT_ID is the project ID of the Google Cloud project that
contains the Filestore instance. You can skip this
flag if the Filestore instance is in the gcloud default
project. You can set the default project by running:
gcloud config set project project-id
LOCATION is the location where the Filestore
instance resides. For regional and enterprise instances, specify a region.
For all other instances, specify a zone. Run the
gcloud filestore zones list
command to get a list of supported zones. You can skip this flag
if the Filestore instance is in the gcloud default
zone. You can set the default zone by running:
gcloud config set filestore/zone zone
PERFORMANCE is the performance configuration used to specify custom performance settings independently of the chosen capacity.
Note: After activating custom performance for an instance you can't deactivate it for that instance. Instances with activated custom performance are billed according to purchased IOPS. For details, see configure custom performance and Filestore pricing .
You can use only one of the following options:
max-iops-per-tb specifies an IOPS-per-TiB rate that scales linearly with instance capacity.
max-iops specifies fixed IOPS rate that doesn't scale with instance capacity.
The format looks as follows:
--performance=max-iops-per-tb=17000
FILE_SHARE_NAME is the name of the file share that is served
from the Filestore instance. File share names cannot be changed
after instance creation.
FILE_SHARE_SIZE is the new size you want for the file share. You
can specify the file share size in whole numbers using either GiB (default)
or TiB .
To see your available quota, go to the Quotas page in the Google Cloud console:
Go to the Quotas page
DESCRIPTION is the optional Filestore
instance description.
FILE_NAME is the name of the json configuration file for IP-
based access control.
Example json configuration file:
{
"--file-share":
{
"capacity": "4096",
"name": "my_vol",
"nfs-export-options": [
{
"access-mode": "READ_WRITE",
"ip-ranges": [
"10.0.0.0",
"10.2.0.0"
],
"squash-mode": "ROOT_SQUASH",
"anon_uid": 1003,
"anon_gid": 1003
},
{
"access-mode": "READ_ONLY",
"ip-ranges": [
"10.0.1.0/28"
],
"squash-mode": "NO_ROOT_SQUASH"
}
],
}
}
where:
ip-ranges is the IP address or range to grant access to. You can
specify multiple IP addresses or ranges by separating them with a comma.
Only the following service tiers support configuration settings for
overlapping IP address ranges :
Zonal
Regional
Enterprise
access-mode is the access level to grant to clients whose
IP address falls within ip-range . It can have the values of
READ_WRITE or READ_ONLY . The default value is READ_WRITE .
squash-mode can have the values ROOT_SQUASH or
NO_ROOT_SQUASH . ROOT_SQUASH removes root level access to the clients
whose IP address falls within ip-range , while NO_ROOT_SQUASH
enables root access. The default value is NO_ROOT_SQUASH .
anon_uid is the user ID value that you want to map to anon_uid . The
default value is 65534 .
anon_gid is the group ID value that you want to map to anon_gid . The
default value is 65534 .
Example
The following example updates the nfs-server instance by increasing the
file share size to 3 TiB .
gcloud filestore instances update nfs-server --zone=us-central1-c --file-share=name="vol1",capacity=3TiB
```
REST API
Have gcloud CLI installed and initialized , which lets
you generate an access token for the Authorization header.
Use cURL to call the Filestore API :
curl --request PATCH \
'https://file.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT /locations/ LOCATION /instances?instanceId= NAME ?updateMask=performanceConfig%2CdeletionProtectionReason%2CdeletionProtectionEnabled&key= YOUR_API_KEY ' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"tier":" TIER ",
"networks":[
{
"network":" NETWORK "
}
],
"performanceConfig": {" PERFORMANCE "}
"fileShares":[
{"capacityGb": CAPACITY ,"name":" SHARE_NAME "}
],
"deletionProtectionEnabled": true,
"deletionProtectionReason": " PROTECTION_REASON "}' \
--compressed
Where:
PROJECT is the name of the project where your
instance will reside. For example, my-genomics-project .
LOCATION is the location where the instance
will reside. For example, us-east1 or us-central1-a .
NAME is the name of the instance you
want to create. For example, my-genomics-instance .
PERFORMANCE is the performance configuration
used to specify custom performance settings.
Note: After activating custom performance for an instance you can't deactivate it for that instance. Instances with activated custom performance are billed according to purchased IOPS. For details, see configure custom performance and Filestore pricing .
You can use only one of the provided options.
iopsPerTB enables custom performance with a user-defined IOPS rate that scales with instance capacity. To define IOPS per TiB, use the maxIopsPerTb field.
fixedIops enables custo, performance with a fixed IOPS rate that doesn't scale with instance capacity. To define fixed IOPS value, use the maxIops field.
The format is as follows:
"performanceConfig": {
"iopsPerTb" : {
"maxIopsPerTb":17000
}
}
CAPACITY is the size, in GiB, you want to
allocate for the instance. For example, 1024 .
SHARE_NAME is the name of the file share. For
example, vol1 .
PROTECTION_REASON if you choose to use the
deletionProtectionEnabled flag, you have the option of adding a note
regarding the setting. To add the note, use the optional
deletionProtectionReason flag and include a description of the
justification for the setting you chose. For example, "All genomics
data must adhere to current organization policies." For more
information, see Deletion protection .
Example
The following example updates the nfs-server instance by decreasing the IOPS per TiB ratio to 12000 .
curl --request PATCH \
'https://file.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/instances?instanceId=nfs-server?updateMask=performanceConfig%2CdeletionProtectionReason&key=12334fr232' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"performanceConfig":
{
"iopsPerTb":
{
"maxIopsPerTb":12000
}
},
"deletionProtectionReason":"Deletion+not+allowed"}' \
--compressed
What's next
