Mounting file shares on Compute Engine clients
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to mount a Filestore file share on a
Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance that's in the same Google Cloud
project and VPC network . To learn how to mount file shares
on clients in a remote network, see
Mounting file shares on remote clients .
If you're looking to access Filestore instances from Google Kubernetes Engine
clusters instead, see
Access Filestore instances with the Filestore CSI driver .
Before you begin
Ensure that the network firewall is properly configured for use with
Filestore. See
Configuring firewall rules
for details.
Mounting a file share on a Compute Engine VM instance
Use one of the following procedures to mount a Filestore file share
on a Compute Engine VM. We recommend mounting to a n1-standard-8 VM or
greater for optimal performance.
Linux: mount
Note: When mounting with the mount command, the file share is unmounted
when the client VM reboots. To keep the file share mounted when the client VM
reboots, use fstab or autofs instead.
To manually mount a file share to a Linux client VM:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page.
Go to the VM instances page
Locate the Linux VM you want to use as a client, then click SSH to
open a terminal on that VM.
Optional : Mounting a file share on a client VM with multiple network
interfaces through a secondary network.
Details (Click to expand)
If you want to mount the file share through a secondary network, namely
an interface other than nic0 , you must modify the client VM's
routing policy. Run:
sudo ip route \
add filestore-reserved-address-range \
via default-gateway-of-nic-to-filestore
where:
filestore-reserved-address-range is the
reserved address range for use by the Filestore instance.
default-gateway-of-nic-to-filestore is the
default gateway IP address of the NIC connected to the VPC
network that is shared with the Filestore instance.
For more information about using Compute Engine instances with
multiple NICs, see Configure routing for an additional network interface .
Install NFS:
Debian/Ubuntu
Use the following commands to install NFS on Debian or Ubuntu.
sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get install nfs-common
RHEL/CentOS
Use the following commands to install NFS on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS.
sudo yum update && sudo yum install nfs-utils
SUSE
Use the following commands to install NFS on SUSE.
sudo zypper update && sudo zypper -n install nfs-client
Make a local directory to map to the Filestore file share:
sudo mkdir -p mount-point-directory
where mount-point-directory is the directory to
create, for example /mnt/filedir .
Mount the file share from the Filestore instance by running
the mount command. You can use any
NFS mount options . For the best
performance, we recommend using the following NFS mount options:
Option
Description
hard
The NFS client retries NFS requests indefinitely. To reduce the possibility of I/O disruptions when the Filestore instance reboots, we recommend using the hard mount option for both Linux and Windows clients.
timeo=600
The NFS client waits 600 deciseconds (60 seconds) before retrying an NFS request.
retrans=3
The NFS client attempts NFS requests three times before taking further recovery action.
rsize=524288
The NFS client can receive a maximum of 524,288 bytes from the NFS server per READ request. Note : For basic-tier instances, set the rsize value to 1048576 .
wsize=524288
The NFS client can send a maximum of 524,288 bytes to the NFS server per WRITE request.
resvport
The NFS client uses a privileged source port when communicating with the NFS server for this mount point.
async
The NFS client delays sending application writes to the NFS server until certain conditions are met. Caution : Using the sync option significantly reduces performance.
For reduced mounting latency, specify the -o tcp option.
If you are mounting a regional, zonal or
enterprise
instance to a client VM that's running Linux kernel version 5.3+,
consider specifying the
nconnect
mount option for increased NFS performance.
For specific service tiers, we recommend specifying the following number of connections between the client and server:
Tier
Capacity
Number of connections
Regional, zonal
1-9.75 TiB
nconnect=2
Regional, zonal
10-100 TiB
nconnect=7
Enterprise
-
nconnect=2
High scale SSD
-
nconnect=7
In general, the larger the file share capacity and the fewer the connecting client VMs, the more performance you gain by specifying additional connections with nconnect .
Run the mount command with your preferred options, similar to the
following:
sudo mount -o rw ip-address :/ file-share mount-point-directory
where:
ip-address is the IP address for the
Filestore instance.
file-share is the name of the file share on
the instance.
mount-point-directory is the path where you
want to map the Filestore file share to.
You can get the IP address and file share name of an instance from any
of following sources:
The Filestore instances page.
Go to the Filestore instances page .
The IP_ADDRESS field in the results from the
filestore instances list
command.
The ipAddresses section in the results from the
filestore instances describe
command.
For example, given a Filestore instance with an IP address
10.0.1.2 and a file share named share1 , the following command mounts
the file share to the local mount point directory /mnt/render :
sudo mount 10.0.1.2:/share1 /mnt/render
Note: We recommend optimizing the NFS read throughput by adjusting the read_ahead_kb parameter value. For more information, see Optimize the NFS read throughput with read_ahead_kb parameter .
Optional : Run chmod to set permissions
on the mount directory so that someone other than root users can write to it.
To set directory permissions, run the following command:
sudo chmod permissions mount-point-directory
where:
permissions is the set of permissions to
grant. For example, chmod go+rw makes the directory readable and
writable by members in the group that owns the directory and all other
users. For more information about setting permissions, see
Configuring access on a file share .
mount-point-directory is the path to the directory where the
Filestore file share is mounted.
Optional : Confirm that the Filestore file share is
mounted:
df -h --type=nfs
The output should contain an entry similar to the following:
Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
10.0.1.2:/share1 1018G 76M 966G 1% /mnt/render
10.0.2.2:/vol3 1018G 76M 966G 1% /mnt/filestore3
If you need to use NFS file locking, you might need to
set the ports used by the statd
and nlockmgr daemons and
configure firewall rules
to open up those ports.
Linux: /etc/fstab
You can make file shares automatically mount to client VMs during boot up by
modifying the client's /etc/fstab file:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page.
Go to the VM instances page
Locate the Linux VM you want to use as a client, then click SSH to
open a terminal on that VM.
Optional : Mounting a file share on a client VM that has multiple
network interfaces through a secondary network.
Details (Click to expand)
If you want to mount the file share through a secondary network, namely
an interface other than nic0 , you must modify the client VM's
routing policy:
In /etc/default/instance_configs.cfg , set the setup flag for NetworkInterfaces to false :
[NetworkInterfaces]
dhclient_script = /sbin/google-dhclient-script
dhcp_command =
ip_forwarding = true
setup = false
In /etc/network/interfaces , add the following lines:
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet dhcp
up ip route add filestore-reserved-address-range via default-gateway-of-nic-to-filestore
where:
filestore-reserved-address-range is the
reserved address range for use by the Filestore instance.
default-gateway-of-nic-to-filestore is the
default gateway IP address of the NIC connected to the VPC
network that is shared with the Filestore instance.
For more information about using Compute Engine instances with
multiple NICs, see Configure routing for an additional network interface .
Install NFS:
Debian/Ubuntu
Use the following commands to install NFS on Debian or Ubuntu.
sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get install nfs-common
RHEL/CentOS
Use the following commands to install NFS on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS.
sudo yum update && sudo yum install nfs-utils
SUSE
Use the following commands to install NFS on SUSE.
sudo zypper update && sudo zypper -n install nfs-client
Make a local directory to map to the Filestore file share:
sudo mkdir -p mount-point-directory
where mount-point-directory is the directory to
create, for example /mnt/filedir .
Open the /etc/fstab file:
sudo vim /etc/fstab
Add the following line in the /etc/fstab file:
ip - address : / file - share mount - point - directory nfs options , _netdev 0 0
where:
ip-address is the IP address for the Filestore instance.
file-share is the name of the file share on the instance.
mount-point-directory is the path you want to map the
Filestore file share to.
options are the NFS mount options. We
recommend keeping the default NFS mount options, with the following
exceptions:
For automounting, we recommend specifying -o tcp to reduce the
latency when mounting and unmounting.
If you are mounting a regional, zonal or enterprise
instance to a client VM that's running Linux kernel version 5.3+,
consider specifying the
nconnect
mount option for increased NFS performance.
For specific service tiers, we recommend specifying the following number of connections between the client and server:
Tier
Capacity
Number of connections
Regional, zonal
1-9.75 TiB
nconnect=2
Regional, zonal
10-100 TiB
nconnect=7
Enterprise
-
nconnect=2
High scale SSD
-
nconnect=7
In general, the larger the file share capacity and the fewer the connecting client VMs, the more performance you gain by specifying additional connections with nconnect .
Example : The following line in /etc/fstab mounts file share vol1
of the Filestore instance with IP address 10.0.0.2 in the
mount point directory /mnt with the default mount options:
10.0.0.2:/vol1 /mnt nfs defaults,_netdev 0 0
Mount everything in /etc/fstab :
sudo mount -a
The file share is now automatically mounted each time the client VM
boots up.
Linux: autofs
You can configure autofs to automatically mount a file share only when it's
accessed and keep it unmounted when it's not used. Compared to having a file
share statically mounted in /etc/fstab , this method helps conserve client VM
resources in situations where the client needs to map to many mount
points.
Install NFS and autofs on the client VM
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page.
Go to the VM instances page
Locate the Linux VM you want to use as a client, then click SSH to open a
terminal on that VM.
Optional : Mounting a file share on a client VM with multiple network
interfaces through a secondary network.
Details (Click to expand)
If you want to mount the file share through a secondary network, namely
an interface other than nic0 , you must modify the client VM's
routing policy:
In /etc/default/instance_configs.cfg , set the setup flag for NetworkInterfaces to false :
[NetworkInterfaces]
dhclient_script = /sbin/google-dhclient-script
dhcp_command =
ip_forwarding = true
setup = false

auto eth1
iface eth1 inet dhcp
up ip route add filestore-reserved-address-range via default-gateway-of-nic-to-filestore
where:
filestore-reserved-address-range is the reserved address range for use by the Filestore instance.
default-gateway-of-nic-to-filestore is the default gateway IP address of the NIC connected to the VPC network that is shared with the Filestore instance.

multiple NICs, see Configure routing for an additional network interface .
Install NFS by running the following commands:
Debian/Ubuntu
Use the following commands to install NFS on Debian or Ubuntu.
sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get install nfs-common
RHEL/CentOS
Use the following commands to install NFS on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS.
sudo yum update && sudo yum install nfs-utils
SUSE
Use the following commands to install NFS on SUSE.
sudo zypper update && sudo zypper -n install nfs-client
From the terminal window of the client VM, install autofs :
Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install autofs
RHEL/CentOS
sudo yum install autofs
SUSE
sudo zypper -n install autofs
Configure autofs to dynamically mount the file share to the client VM
Enable autofs :
sudo systemctl enable --now autofs
Make a local directory to map to the Filestore file share:
sudo mkdir -p mount-point-directory
where mount-point-directory is the directory to
create. It must not contain any subdirectories. In this guide, we use
/nfs as the mount point directory.
Open the /etc/auto.master file:
sudo vim /etc/auto.master
Add the following line in the /etc/auto.master file:
/nfs /etc/auto.nfs --timeout seconds
where seconds is the duration in seconds before the mount timeout.
The default value is 300 . Setting this value to 0 disables
unmounting by autofs .
Create a file called /etc/auto.nfs :
sudo vim /etc/auto.nfs
Add the following line in the /etc/auto.nfs file:
mount - point - subdir options ip - address : / file - share
where:
mount-point-subdir is the subdirectory in
/nfs you want to map the Filestore file share to. This
subdirectory is dynamically generated and shouldn't exist in the
client VM.
options are the NFS mount options. We
recommend keeping the default NFS mount options, with the following
exceptions:
For automounting, we recommend specifying -o tcp to reduce the
latency when mounting and unmounting.
If you are mounting a regional, zonal or enterprise
instance to a client VM that's running Linux kernel version 5.3+,
consider specifying the
nconnect
mount option for increased NFS performance.
For specific service tiers, we recommend specifying the following number of connections between the client and server:
Tier

Enterprise
-
nconnect=2
High scale SSD
-
nconnect=7
In general, the larger the file share capacity and the fewer the connecting client VMs, the more performance you gain by specifying additional connections with nconnect .
ip-address is the IP address for the
Filestore instance.
file-share is the name of the file share on
the instance.
Example : The following line in /etc/auto.nfs mounts file share vol1
of the Filestore instance with IP address 10.0.0.2 in the
dynamically generated subdirectory file-shares with read/write access
granted:
file-shares -rw 10.0.0.2:/vol1
Test your configuration
If the file share is mounted, you need to unmount it:
sudo umount mount-point-directory
where mount-point-directory is the path where the
Filestore file share is mapped to.
If there is an /etc/fstab entry that mounts the file share at system
boot, make sure to remove it.
Reload autofs :
sudo service autofs reload
Confirm that your configuration works:
ls mount-point-directory / mount-point-subdir
where:
mount-point-directory is the mount point directory indicated in the /etc/auto.master file.
mount-point-subdir is the mount point subdirectory indicated in the /etc/auto.nfs file.
From our example, the command would be:
ls /nfs/file-shares
If the automount is configured correctly, the system first mounts the
file share and then returns the results of the ls command. The file
share is automatically unmounted after a period of inactivity, which is
defined in the timeout value specified in the /etc/auto.master file.
Windows
Connect to the Windows VM
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM Instances page.
Go to the VM instances page
Locate the Windows VM that you want to use as a client, then click RDP
to open a remote desktop connection to that VM. For more information, see
Connecting to Windows instances .
Install NFS on the Windows VM
On the Windows VM, open PowerShell as an administrator to ensure proper NFS access and permissions.
In PowerShell, install the NFS client:
Install-WindowsFeature -Name NFS-Client
Restart the Windows VM instance as prompted, then open a new remote desktop
connection.
Configure the user ID used by the NFS client
In PowerShell, run the following commands to create two new registry entries, AnonymousUid and AnonymousGid :
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ClientForNFS\CurrentVersion\Default" `
-Name "AnonymousUid" -Value "0" -PropertyType DWORD
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ClientForNFS\CurrentVersion\Default" `
-Name "AnonymousGid" -Value "0" -PropertyType DWORD
Restart the NFS client service:
nfsadmin client stop
nfsadmin client start
Map the file share to the Windows VM
Exit PowerShell to leave the administrator's session. If you omit this step, applications running in the standard user's session won't be able to see or access this file share.
exit
Optional : Mounting a file share on a client VM with multiple network
interfaces through a secondary network.
Details (Click to expand)
If you want to mount the file share through a secondary network, namely
an interface other than nic0 , you must modify the client VM's
routing policy. Run:
route - p ^
add filestore - reserved - address - range ^
mask address - range - subnet - mask ^
default - gateway - of - nic - to - filestore
where:
filestore-reserved-address-range is the
reserved address range for use by the Filestore instance.
address-range-subnet-mask is the
subnet mask of filestore-reserved-address-range .
For example, a /29 reserved address range would use the
255.255.255.248 subnet mask.
default-gateway-of-nic-to-filestore is the
default gateway IP address of the NIC connected to the VPC
network that is shared with the Filestore instance.
Example :
route -p add 10 .65.21.176 mask 255 .255.255.248 10 .128.0.1
For more information about using Compute Engine instances with
multiple NICs, see Configure routing for an additional network interface .
From Command Prompt , map the file share to a drive letter:
net use drive-letter : \\ filestore-ip \ file-share-name
where:
filestore-ip is the IP address of the Filestore instance.
file-share-name is the name of the file share on the Filestore instance.
drive-letter is the letter of the drive you want to assign for the mapping.
Example
The following command maps file share vol1 on the
Filestore instance with the IP address 10.0.0.2 to drive
z: on the client Windows VM:
net use Z: \\10.0.0.2\vol1
Optional : To use NFS file locking, verify the following:
Ensure that the firewall rules are configured
for all required NFS ports, including statd and nlockmgr .
Ensure that the Windows NFS client is configured with reserved ports
using a command similar to the following in PowerShell:
nfsadmin client config protocol = tcp UseReservedPorts = yes
nfsadmin client stop
nfsadmin client start
Creating and mounting subdirectories on the file share
Once your file share is mounted on a client VM, you can create subdirectories on
the file share, which clients can then mount directly instead of mounting the
entire file share:
To create a subdirectory on the mounted file share, run:
sudo mkdir -p mount-point-directory / file-share-sub-dir
where:
mount-point-directory is the path where you map
the file share to.
file-share-sub-dir is the path of the
subdirectory in the file share that you want to create.
This command creates the subdirectory on both the client VM and the file
share. For example, if you mounted file share 10.0.0.2:/vol1 to the
directory /mnt on the client VM, the command sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs
creates 10.0.0.2:/vol1/nfs on the file share and /mnt/nfs on the client
VM.
Optional : If you want to mount the file share subdirectory to the
directory on the client VM where the file share is mounted, you
must unmount the file share first:
sudo umount mount-point-directory
where mount-point-directory is the directory
that the file share is mapped to.
Mount the subdirectory:
sudo mount ip-address :/ file-share / file-share-sub-dir mount-point-directory
where:
ip-address is the IP address for the
Filestore instance.
file-share is the name of the file share on
the instance.
file-share-sub-dir is the path of the
subdirectory in the file share to mount.
mount-point-directory is the path where you
want to map the Filestore file share to.
Example : In the following command:
sudo mount 10.0.0.2:/vol1/nfs /mnt/nfs
10.0.0.2 is the IP address of the Filestore instance.
vol1 is the name of the file share.
nfs is a file share subdirectory.
/mnt/nfs is the directory on the client VM where the file share
subdirectory nfs is mapped to.
