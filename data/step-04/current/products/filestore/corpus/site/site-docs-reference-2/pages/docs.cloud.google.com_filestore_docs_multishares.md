Filestore multishares for GKE
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Filestore multishares for GKE allocates up to 80
shares across a single
enterprise-tier instance.
This capability optimizes share usage within your Filestore instances
and provides the following benefits:
Gives users the control to estimate and set maximum share capacity
Optimizes the number of shares per instance
Optimizes the use of Filestore instances in their associated
GKE storage pools
Improves cost
Why use Filestore multishares for GKE?
A Filestore instance is a fully managed network-attached storage (NAS)
system you can use with your GKE instances.
Filestore multishares for GKE combined with the
GKE Filestore CSI driver ,
version 1.27, provides the following benefits:
Provides a comprehensive view of your persistent volumes (PVs)
as one pool of storage. The driver dynamically creates or deletes
Filestore instances as you add, delete, or resize volumes. The driver
manages your Filestore instances as one large pool of volumes with
common characteristics according to the StorageClass definition, and includes
the ability to scale, or backup, each volume separately.
Supports multiwriter access for applications
that require a shared file system for data.
Supports regional storage resilient to zone
outages.
Supports multiple shares with smaller, more flexible sizing for improved
utilization and cost efficiency of each Filestore instance.
Allocates up to 80 shares across a single Filestore enterprise-tier
instance:
Each share maps to a unique persistent volume in GKE.
Using GKE StorageClasses, you can restrict maximum share
size to 128 GiB, 256 GiB, 512 GiB, or 1024 GiB
(1 TiB).
Based on the size specified, the GKE Filestore CSI
driver limits the maximum number of shares per Filestore instance,
creating a maximum capacity of 80, 40, 20, or 10 shares per instance,
respectively.
GKE Filestore CSI driver versions 1.23 through
1.26 still support up to 10 shares per enterprise instance.
Supports greater flexibility for organizations that require both smaller
volumes for multiple clients and multiwriter access across a shared network:
Supports an extended share size of 10 GiB to 1 TiB (1024 GiB),
or the maximum share size specified.
GKE Filestore CSI driver versions 1.23 through
1.26 support share sizes ranging between 100 GiB and 1 TiB.
Supports dynamic volume provisioning ,
scaling share and instance capacity up or down as needed:
If the application workload exceeds 80 persistent volume claims (PVCs) ,
the GKE Filestore CSI driver reflexively creates
more Filestore instances and allocates the necessary shares
dynamically across instances.
When you delete a PV, the GKE Filestore
CSI driver reclaims the allocated share storage and removes the share. The
GKE Filestore CSI driver also deletes the
Filestore instance if all associated shares have been deleted.
When you create, delete, or edit the capacity of a PV, the GKE
Filestore CSI driver adds or reclaims capacity of the associated
Filestore instance to accommodate the capacity of all shares.
The size of the Filestore instance can fluctuate in increments
of 256 GiB.
The performance of the underlying Filestore enterprise multishare
instance is shared, giving higher throughput for specific GKE
PVs when needed.
This supports upscaling of PV capacity based on workload demands with
near-zero downtime.
Supports backward compatibility with instances created using the GKE
Filestore CSI driver versions 1.23 (the original version released
with multishare capabilities) through version 1.26:
Shares on these instances can take advantage of the extended minimum share
size of 10 GiB.
StorageClasses and dynamic volume provisioning
In order to access the Filestore multishares feature, you must
first enable the GKE Filestore CSI driver ,
version 1.23 or later. Once enabled, you can take advantage of
GKE StorageClasses
which make use of an automated process called dynamic volume provisioning
to effectively manage the lifecycle of your PVs
and PVCs .
The GKE Filestore CSI driver creates StorageClasses
to meet your specific needs. The following table compares Filestore
enterprise multishare performance in contrast with single share options:

How it works
Using GKE Filestore CSI driver version 1.27 and the
max-volume-size StorageClass parameter, you have greater control to set a
maximum share size. Referencing this value, the driver restricts the number
of shares allowed on the instance.
To implement this capability, create a new StorageClass
and include the parameter in your configuration file, assigning it one of the
four accepted values listed in the first column:
Maximum volume size (share size)
Maximum number of shares per instance
128 GiB
80
256 GiB
40
512 GiB
20
1024 GiB (1 TiB)
10
If you want to restrict share size to 128 GiB, use the key-value pair
max-volume-size: "128Gi" .
If a value is not specified for the max-volume-size parameter, or the parameter
is omitted altogether, the driver assigns a default value of 1024 GiB per
share. This effectively sets a maximum count of 10 shares on the instance. For a
detailed example, see Optimize multishares .
Backward compatibility
The latest multishare feature supports backward compatibility with instances
created using GKE Filestore CSI driver versions 1.23
(the original version released with multishare capabilities) through version
1.26:
Existing instances can create new PVCs, or shares, with the extended minimum
size constraint. As a result, share size now ranges from 10 GiB to
1024 GiB (1 TiB) per share.
GKE Filestore CSI driver version 1.27 recognizes
legacy enterprise instances and assigns them a default maximum share size
limit of 1024 GiB. This means legacy instances are limited to no more
than 10 shares per instance.
Legacy instance example
As an example, say you install GKE Filestore CSI driver
version 1.25 and create a StorageClass labeled enterprise-multishare-rwx . You
then provision a 1 TiB enterprise-tier instance, labeled F1, mapped to a
single 100 GiB share. The driver references instance specifications noted
in the StorageClass for this request.
You then upgrade the GKE Filestore CSI driver to version
1.27, and later provision ten new 10 GiB shares.
The StorageClass configuration file used to create F1 does not include the
max-volume-size parameter and so the driver recognizes instance F1 as a legacy
instance, assigning a default maximum share size of 1024 GiB for all new
shares mapped to the instance. The driver then references this value on future
requests that might include the instance. The new minimum share size of
10 GiB is also available.
Regarding the provision request for ten 10 GiB PVCs, nine are mapped to F1,
and then a second instance, F2, is created to provision the final 10 GiB
share.
Notice that the driver first recognizes the maximum allowed share size, and then
uses that value to determine the maximum share count that can be mapped to a
Filestore instance. Once an instance's maximum share count is met, new
instances are created, if needed, to fill a provision request.
Monitoring
For information on how to monitor instance performance, see
Monitoring instances and quota .
Feature limitations
The following limitations apply:
The Filestore multishare feature is limited to the Filestore
enterprise service tier.
GKE StorageClasses are immutable. Maximum share size should be
chosen carefully.
If you need to change the maximum share size for your Filestore
instances, you must create a new custom StorageClass with the updated size,
create new instances, and then copy and move your data over.
Each Filestore enterprise instance can host up to 80 shares
or GKE PVs. Exceeding 80 PVCs triggers the
GKE Filestore CSI driver to create more
Filestore instances and allocate those shares dynamically across
instances. Creating a new Filestore share or PV may, in some
circumstances, take extra time. If your application requires immediate PV
provisioning, include the following specification in the StorageClass YAML
file:
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
Snapshots are not yet supported for
Filestore multishares. If needed, you can use a
single share Filestore StorageClass
to manually create snapshots through the Filestore API.
Multishare instances and associated shares can take several minutes to create
and are not visible until create operations are complete.
Some PV delete operations can take significant time to finish. PV create
or PV expand
operations initiated by PVCs defined by the same StorageClass may be blocked
during this time.
The GKE Filestore CSI driver is supported for
clusters using Linux.
If you anticipate workloads with higher metadata overhead, we recommend setting
a maximum share size that can accommodate your application's capacity needs.
For example, say you provision a Filestore enterprise
multishare instance, allowing a maximum size of 256 GiB per share,
resulting in a set maximum limit of 40 shares on the instance.
For example, say a share on the instance experiences failed write operations,
and in reviewing the instance's free raw capacity percent metric
in Metrics Explorer, you see that the instance lacks suitable capacity. We
recommend you configure new multishare instances with a larger share size,
say 512 GiB, to meet your workload needs. Note that this results in fewer
allowed shares on the instance, in this example, 20.
The maximum share size values are limited to 128 GiB, 256 GiB,
512 GiB, or 1024 GiB (1 TiB).
For workloads that require shares 1 TiB in size, use a single share per
instance.
Pricing
Once billing is enabled, charges apply based on the underlying Filestore
enterprise service tier. With shared capacity across multiple smaller volumes,
users can benefit from a significant reduction in storage costs.
