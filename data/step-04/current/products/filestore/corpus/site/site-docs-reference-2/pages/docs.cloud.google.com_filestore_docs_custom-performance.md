Custom performance
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page discusses custom performance settings for your Filestore
instances.
Read and write IOPS
You can use 100% of IOPS purchased for your file system for read and write operations combined. Read and write operations have different weights, with each write operation equivalent to 3.33 of a read operation. For example, if your file system uses 33% of its purchased IOPS for read operations, it can simultaneously use up to 67% of its purchased IOPS for write operations.
Custom performance supports up to 100 client connections per 1,000 purchased IOPS, regardless of the capacity range or service tier being regional or zonal.
IOPS accrued from replicated data, such as backup operations, don't count towards user-purchased IOPS.
Example IOPS calculation
Assuming you have purchased 4,000 IOPS:
If you want to use them for read IOPS, you would have access to a maximum of 4,000 read IOPS.
If you want to use them for write IOPS, you would have access to a maximum of 1,200 write IOPS.
If you want to use 900 IOPS for write operations, it will effectively use 3,000 of your IOPS budget, leaving 1,000 IOPS for read operations.
If you need more IOPS or throughput, you can increase your purchased IOPS rate.
Configure custom performance
You can set custom performance for zonal and regional instances
that already support it. Basic tiers don't support this feature.
Custom performance instances are billed differently than instances where custom performance is not configured. For details, see Filestore pricing .
You have the following options to configure custom performance:
Set an IOPS per TiB ratio where IOPS scale linearly with the
instance's size.
Set a fixed IOPS rate. The rate is steady, regardless of instance size.
Note: When you enable custom performance in Google Cloud console and don't provide any specific configuration, a default, recommended IOPS rate is suggested for this instance. After you activate
custom performance for an instance and save your settings, you can't deactivate it for that instance.
For details on setting custom performance, see creating instances .
Check custom performance status
If you want to the check the custom performance status, follow these instructions:
Google Cloud console
Go to the Filestore Instances page
Click the Instance ID to open the Instance Details page.
Go to the Overview tab and look for a Custom Performance entry.
Not supported means that custom performance is not supported for a specific instance. For example, when you create a basic tier instance, or when the instance was created before the feature was launched.
Enabled means that custom performance is supported and active for this instance.
Disabled means that custom performance is supported but not enabled for this instance.
gcloud
Get information about a Filestore instance by running the
instances describe
command:
gcloud filestore instances describe INSTANCE_ID --project= PROJECT_ID --location= LOCATION
The output might vary depending on the instance settings. The following is an example output:
createTime: '2021-10-11T17:28:23.340943077Z'
customPerformanceSupported: true
fileShares:
- capacityGb: '1024'
name: vol1
kmsKeyName: projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/keyRings/example-ring/cryptoKeys/example-key
labels:
key:val
name: projects/yourproject/locations/us-central1/instances/nfs-server
networks:
- ipAddresses:
- 10.0.0.2
network: default
reservedIpRange: 10.0.0.0/26
performanceConfig:
iopsPerTb:
maxIopsPerTb: '17000'
performanceLimits:
maxIops: '17000'
maxReadIops: '17000'
maxReadThroughputBps: '417792000'
maxWriteIops: '5100'
maxWriteThroughputBps: '139264000'
state: READY
tier: REGIONAL
If customPerformanceSupported parameter is present and set to true it means that custom performance is supported for this instance. If the flag is not present, custom performance is not supported.
If performanceConfig parameter is present, it means that custom performance is enabled for this instance.
REST API
Have gcloud CLI installed and initialized , which lets
you generate an access token for the Authorization header.
Use cURL to call the Filestore API :
curl -s \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
GET "https://file.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/ PROJECT /locations/ LOCATION /instances/ INSTANCE_NAME "
Where:
PROJECT is the name of the project where your
instance is located. For example, my-project .
LOCATION is the location where your instance
resides. For example, us-central1-a .
INSTANCE_NAME is the name of the instance you
want to view. For example, nfs-server .
If custom performance is supported and configured for the provided instance, the response will include the following parameters:
"customPerformanceSupported": true,
"performanceConfig": {
"fixedIops": {
"maxIops": "9000"
}
},
"performanceLimits": {
"maxReadIops": "9000",
"maxWriteIops": "2700",
"maxReadThroughputBps": "221184000",
"maxWriteThroughputBps": "73728000",
"maxIops": "9000"
}
Custom performance calculations
The following table displays performance calculations based on provisioned IOPS per TiB and allocated capacity. The calculations are based on different capacity ranges to show how the values for read IOPS, write IOPS, read throughput, and write throughput change for the minimum and maximum IOPS per TiB values.
For more information, see the read and write IOPS section of this document.

Depending on the access to the small capacity instances feature, the lower capacity range for Filestore regional instances can be either 100 GiB to 10,239 GiB or 1 TiB to 9.75 TiB. For more information, see Small capacity Filestore instances .
For details about performance limits when custom performance is
not activated, see performance limits .
Monitoring
To monitor instance IOPS usage, you can use the Metrics Explorer to view the following metrics: read_ops_count , write_ops_count , and metadata_ops_count .
For more information, see monitoring instances .
