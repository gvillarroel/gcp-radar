Monitoring instances and quota
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to monitor your Filestore instances and set up
alerts for low disk space and low backups quota.
You can monitor Filestore instances using
Cloud Monitoring .
Before you begin
Before you begin, make sure you have access to the following roles:
Monitoring Viewer
Monitoring Editor
To see how to grant access to these roles, see Grant access to Cloud Monitoring .
Add a Filestore metric chart to a Cloud Monitoring dashboard
To see Filestore performance metrics in a Cloud Monitoring
dashboard, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
leaderboard Metrics explorer page:
Go to Metrics explorer
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Click the Select a metric expandable section.
In the Filter by resource or metric name field, type filestore and
select the Filestore Instance expandable section.
Select an available metric to view:
Metric
Description
Basic tiers
Regional, zonal, and enterprise tiers
Average read latency
The average time a read operation takes (in milliseconds).
✓
Average write latency
The average time a write operation takes (in milliseconds).
✓
Bytes written
Number of bytes written.
✓
✓
Bytes read
Number of bytes read from persistent storage. This can be less than the
number of bytes read by clients, as some reads might be served from a memory
cache. *
✓
✓
Disk read operation count
Number of disk read operations. If the Filestore instance
caches the data, some read operations are not reflected as disk reads.
*
✓
✓
Disk write operation count
Number of disk write operations. If the Filestore instance
caches the data, some write operations are not reflected as disk writes.
*
✓
✓
Metadata operations count
Number of disk metadata operations.
✓
Free bytes
Number of free disk bytes.
✓
✓
Free disk space percent
Percentage of free disk bytes.
✓
✓
Free raw capacity percent
Free raw capacity as a percentage of total space.
✓
Procedure call count
Returns the same information as the nfsstat -s command.
✓
Snapshots used bytes
The amount of space used for storing snapshots, measured in bytes.
✓
Time (in milliseconds) spent on read operations
Time spent on disk reads.
✓
Time (in milliseconds) spent on write operations
Time spent on disk writes.
✓
Used bytes
Number of used disk bytes.
✓
✓
Used space percent
Percentage of used disk bytes.
✓
✓
* Memory-cached operations only occur in basic tier instances.
Optional configurations:
Field
Description
Filter
Filter to the Filestore instances that you want to monitor.
Group by
Combining data from similar time series.
Aggregator
Combine time series using common functions.
Minimum alignment period
The time interval for which aggregation takes place.
If you want to add more metrics to the chart, click Add another metric .
Click Save Chart to create a dashboard. Alternatively, you can add the
chart to an existing dashboard.
Metric definitions
The following sections describe certain Filestore-specific metrics
in detail.
Free raw capacity percent
The free raw capacity percent
metric represents capacity available to users, not necessarily the available
raw disk space.
Your instance replicates data to provide durability and to help support
performance, resulting in a total storage capacity greater than the
user-specified capacity of the instance.
The free raw capacity percent metric represents the percentage of free raw
capacity available to users after any replication performed as a function of
instance durability or performance.
If this metric reaches 0%, new data cannot be written to the cluster until more
free space becomes available.
For more information on how to scale instance capacity up or down, see
Scale capacity .
Snapshots used bytes
The snapshots used bytes metric
represents the number of bytes in use by all snapshots, whether internal or
external. This metric is allocated and indexed by share, not instance.
Used bytes
The used bytes metric represents the
raw data written by the user. It doesn't take into account the space required
for inodes and metadata.
Anticipating capacity
For a better understanding of an instance's available capacity, we recommend
monitoring the available space as well as the written space.
To see the free space on an instance, use the free raw capacity percent
metric.
Each file stored on the file share consumes one inode. If the file system runs
out of inodes, you won't be able to store more files on the file share even
if you haven't reached the maximum allocated capacity.
To see the number of inodes in use, use the df command. For more information,
see Scale capacity and Troubleshoot capacity issues .
Set up alerts
Low disk space
To ensure that your Filestore instances don't run out of free
space, we recommend setting up low disk space alerts.
This guide uses the free disk space percent metric to measure the free disc space for basic instances.
If you want to measure low disk space for zonal, regional, or enterprise instances, use the following steps to set up two separate alerts using free disk space percent and free raw capacity percent metrics.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
notifications Alerting page:
Go to Alerting
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
Click Create Policy .
Click the Select a metric expandable section.
In the Filter by resource or metric name field, type filestore and
select the Filestore Instance expandable section.
Select the Nfs active metric category.
Select the metric Free disk space percent .
Click Apply .
In the Add filters section, click Add a filter .
Click the Filter expandable section and select instance_name .
In the Value field, enter the Filestore instance name
for which you want to receive alerts.
Click Done .
For more information about filtering Cloud Monitoring metrics, see
Filtering .
In the Transform data section, specify the Rolling window and
Rolling window function . Indicate whether you want to include a
secondary data transformation and click Next .
In the Configure alert trigger window, choose a condition type.
Set the following specifications:
Field
Configuration
Alert trigger
Any time series violates
Threshold position
Below threshold
Threshold value

Click Create policy .
Low backups quota
If you are scheduling or automating backups creation for your
Filestore instances, you should set up alerts for when you're
running low on backups quota.

notifications Alerting page:
Go to Alerting
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .

Click Done .
Optional: To add another filter, click Add filter and repeat the
process.

backups" or "Request additional quota".
In the Alert policy name field, enter an alert policy name and click
Next .
Click Create policy .
