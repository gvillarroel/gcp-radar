guidance on selecting the tier that best suits your needs.
Filestore offers the following primary service tiers:
Zonal : Optimized for high performance computing (HPC) and localized workloads.
Regional : Designed for regional availability and resilience against zone outages.
Multishares for GKE (Enterprise) : Specifically optimized for GKE workloads requiring high availability and multiple shares.
Filestore also supports legacy tiers for purposes such as automation backward compatibility or specific cost and performance requirements:
Basic HDD
Basic SSD
For more information on Basic service tiers, see Filestore legacy service tiers .
