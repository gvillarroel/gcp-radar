Overview of the Transcoder API
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides a technical overview of the Transcoder API, including
features, terminology, and useful concepts. The Transcoder API
implements a REST and RPC API that lets you submit, monitor, and manage transcoding jobs
in Google Cloud. To submit jobs using the Transcoder API, you first
upload media assets to Cloud Storage. After processing a job, the
Transcoder API saves the resulting media back to
Cloud Storage.
Key Point: The Transcoder API service is designed for asynchronous work. It
does not provide strong guarantees around the timing of job processing and is
therefore unsuitable for interactive applications where a user waits for the
result.
Features
The Transcoder API includes support for the following features:
Output in different container formats ,
including MPEG-4 (MP4), Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH, also known
as MPEG-DASH), and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)
Output at different bitrates and resolutions, including audio-only output
Conversion to a
high dynamic range (HDR) format
Enhance the video output programmatically, including:
Crop video dimensions
Insert overlay images or animations
Configure low-level encoding parameters, such as the bitrate
Remix existing media content using comprehensive edit lists
Set the job mode to low-latency interactive mode or batch mode
Specify audio loudness normalization
Configure encryption of your output video to support digital rights management
and content protection
Insert ad keyframes to allow video
player clients to insert ads
Create thumbnails from a generated spritesheet of video frames
Create job templates to save and reuse custom or complex configurations for
transcoding jobs
For more information about the MP4 and MPEG-DASH standards, see
The Moving Picture Experts Group website .
For more information about the HLS standard, see
HTTP Live Streaming .

Concepts
This section provides important concepts regarding video files and how they
are used with the Transcoder API.
Components of a video file
Each video file has a container, which is the wrapper for the entire file.
The Transcoder API uses MuxStreams
to define the container. Each container includes a set of
ElementaryStreams
to define the encoding of the video, audio, and caption text tracks for the
file. Video and audio are compressed using codecs.
In the following example, the video is compressed using H.264 and the audio is
compressed using AAC. Both are placed in an MP4 container.
Figure 1. Components of a video file (left) and an example MP4 file (right).
Streaming protocol structure
For streaming media, content providers encode the same content at multiple
bitrates (measured in Kilobits per second). The provider then generates a
manifest file that points to the different files with different bitrates. The
streaming media player uses the manifest file to select the appropriate file,
and then pulls video a few seconds at a time. Each bitrate may be a single file
or multiple short files, depending upon what the player supports.
Different resolutions of media are typically encoded to target different
bitrates. For example, lower bitrates are encoded at standard definition (SD)
instead of high definition (HD). The set of bitrates, resolutions, and codecs is
called the Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) ladder. Streaming content providers may tune
their own ladder based on CDN costs, user device types, bandwidth in-region, and
other factors.

HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) implementation (bottom).
Terminology
This section provides a glossary of useful terms for working with the
Transcoder API.
Ad break
An ad break is a short advertisement that appears before or during media
playback. The Transcoder API supports an
ad break keyframe
in the job configuration. The Transcoder API does not insert or play
ads, or stop media playback; video player clients are responsible for handling
the keyframe.
Atom
An atom is a foundational data structure for defining a video's metadata and
location. A video can comprise a complex nested hierarchy of different types of
atoms, including audio, edit, and text atoms.
Audio atom
An audio atom maps the audio from an elementary stream to an edit list.
Codec type and profile
When selecting the codec for a video stream, you specify the codec type,
such as H.264 and the profile, such as the default high profile.
Container
A container is a wrapper that describes the relationship between the various
components in a multiplexed stream, including media files and metadata. The
Transcoder API supports the MP4, MPEG-DASH, and HLS container formats.
Edit atom
An edit atom defines the start and end offsets for the individual segments of a
stream that you want to combine in an edit list.
Edit list
An edit list defines a sequence of edits as a timeline for the resulting file or manifest from a transcoding job.
Elementary stream
An elementary stream is an encoding of an input file, such as an audio, video,
or caption text track. You must package elementary streams before mapping and
sharing the stream to different output formats.
Entropy encoding
Entropy encoding is a form of lossless compression that the
Transcoder API supports. When configuring jobs, you can specify either
the Context-Adaptive Variable-Length Coding (CAVLC) or Context-Adaptive Binary
Arithmetic Coding (CABAC) entropy coders.
Job
A job is the basic unit for managing work with the Transcoder API.
When you submit a job to the Transcoder API, it is processed
asynchronously in a geographic location known as a
region . You can list and manage all jobs
for a region.
The lifecycle of a job includes three steps: prepare, transcode, and package.
Prepare
Download inputs from Cloud Storage
Analyze inputs
Validate inputs
Transcode
Run transcoding operations on inputs
Package
Stitch inputs
Multiplex inputs
Upload outputs to Cloud Storage
A job has an updated
state .
The service reports errors using the
error
field.
Job configuration
A job configuration represents many of the various settings you can customize
when creating and submitting a job to the Transcoder API. You can
specify configuration settings such as edit lists and where to insert
ad break tags in an output manifest. You can create reusable job
configurations as job templates for use in a Google Cloud region.
Job mode
The Transcoder API supports two
job modes :
interactive and batch.
Interactive mode is the default job mode. Use this mode if you want job
processing to start as soon as possible or if you want to have more granular
control on which jobs are executed first. In this mode, the
concurrent job count quota
controls how many jobs are run concurrently. After this quota is reached, any
jobs you try to start are rejected.
Use batch mode to submit many jobs for which the processing latency isn't as
critical as jobs submitted in the default interactive mode. You can specify the
job processing priority
for a job in this mode. Jobs submitted in batch mode with the same priority
value are put in a first-in, first out queue and have a job state of PENDING
while they wait to be run. In this mode, the
batch pending job count quota controls
how many jobs are queued. After this quota is reached, any jobs you try to start
are rejected. A job transitions to the RUNNING state when it is executed. The
batch concurrent job count quota
controls how many jobs are run concurrently.
You can use both modes at the same time. One mode does not have priority over
the other. For more information on setting the job mode, see
Creating jobs in batch mode .
Job template
By default, the Transcoder API applies a preset template called
preset/web-hd
for populating a job configuration. This job configuration produces the
following output files:
manifest.m3u8 : The
primary playlist
for an HLS media stream. This file contains references to playlists for the
high definition (HD) variant of the output and the standard definition (SD)
variant of the output.
media-hd.m3u8 : Playlist for the high definition variant
media-hd0000000000.ts : High definition video segment file
media-sd.m3u8 : Playlist for the standard definition variant
media-sd0000000000.ts : Standard definition video
segment file
manifest.mpd : The playlist for an MPEG-DASH media stream. This file
contains references to video-only and audio-only segment files.
audio-only0000000000.m4s : Audio-only segment file
video-only-hd0000000000.m4s : High definition video-only segment file
video-only-sd0000000000.m4s : Standard definition video-only segment
file
sd.mp4 : Standalone standard definition video file
hd.mp4 : Standalone high definition video file
You can
create and manage your own custom job templates
and specify them when creating jobs.
Preprocessing
Preprocessing is the stage of a job that takes place prior to the main
transcoding.
Preprocessing configuration
A preprocessing configuration represents the settings you can apply
to a video before the transcoding stage of a job. You can apply cropping or
padding as part of this configuration.
Rate control mode
The rate control mode indicates whether to process a job using either the
constant rate factor (CRF) or variable bitrate (VBR) modes. CRF ensures
constant quality throughout the processed media assets. VBR optimizes the
encoding process to reduce the file size of the processed media assets. For
streaming use cases, select the VBR rate control mode. For archival purposes,
select the CRF rate control mode.
Manifest
A manifest is a description of the available contents and metadata of an
adaptive media stream to a client. In the Transcoder API, you can
configure a job to output a manifest with a file name, a list of multiplexed
streams, as well as the type of the manifest, which must be either HLS or
MPEG-DASH.
Text atom
A text atom maps the text from an elementary stream to an edit list.
Text stream
A text stream encodes text data associated with a video, such as closed captions
or subtitles.
