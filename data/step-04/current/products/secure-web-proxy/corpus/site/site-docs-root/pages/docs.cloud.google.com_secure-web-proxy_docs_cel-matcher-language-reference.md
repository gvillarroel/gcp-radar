CEL matcher language reference
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Common Expression Language (CEL) is an
open source non-Turing complete language that implements common semantics for
expression evaluation. Secure Web Proxy uses a subset of CEL conditions to make
boolean authorization decisions based on attribute data. In general, a condition
expression consists of one or more statements that are joined by logical
operators ( && , || , or ! ). Each statement expresses an attribute-based
control rule that applies to the role binding and ultimately determines whether
access is allowed.
Attributes
Use session attributes and application attributes while defining
Secure Web Proxy policies to describe either the session attributes or
the application attributes that a policy applies to.
Session attributes, described by SessionMatcher , apply to session-specific
attributes such as the source IP address, hosts, and IP range. Application
attributes, described by ApplicationMatcher , apply to application attributes
such as request headers, request method, and request path.
Attributes available to SessionMatcher and ApplicationMatcher
The following table describes attributes that apply to both SessionMatcher and
ApplicationMatcher .
Attribute
Attribute type
Description
source.ip
string
IP address of the client that sent the request.
source.port
integer
Client port that sent the request.
destination.port
integer
Upstream port to which your Secure Web Proxy instance sends the traffic.
host()
string
Host value used for DNS resolution and upstream connections.
This doesn't include the port.
The value of **host()** is determined by the following:
Raw HTTP requests: Host header
Proxy tunnel HTTP CONNECT requests: CONNECT target
source.matchTag( SECURE_TAG )
boolean
True , if the source is associated with
SECURE_TAG .
The argument is the permanent ID of the secure tag, such as
source.matchTag('tagValues/123456') .
source.matchServiceAccount( SERVICE_ACCOUNT )
boolean
True , if the source is associated with
SERVICE_ACCOUNT , such as
source.matchServiceAccount('x@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com') .
inUrlList( HOST_OR_URL , NAMED_LIST )
boolean
True , if HOST_OR_URL is present in
the provided named list NAMED_LIST . For example:
inUrlList(host(), 'projects/1234/locations/us-east1/urlLists/allowed-repos')
inUrlList(request.url(), 'projects/1234/locations/us-east1/urlLists/allowed-repos')
When a UrlList pattern is matched against values without a
forward-slash ( / ), such as in host() ,
only the domain portion of the pattern is matched.
For more information, see
How
UrlList interprets entries .
inIpRange( IP_ADDRESS , IP_RANGE )
boolean
True , if IP_ADDRESS is contained
within the IP_RANGE , such as
inIpRange(source.ip, '1.2.3.0/24') . Subnet masks for IPv6
addresses can't be larger than /64.
Attributes available only to ApplicationMatcher
The following table describes attributes that apply only to
ApplicationMatcher .
Attribute
Attribute type
Description
request.headers
map
String-to-string map of the request headers. If a header
contains multiple values, then the value in this map is a comma-separated
string of all the values of the header. All keys in this map are in
lowercase .
request.method
string
Request method, such as GET or POST.
request.host
string
Convenience equivalent to request.headers['host'] .
We recommend that you use host() in most cases.
request.path
string
Requested URL path.
request.query
string
URL query in the format of
name1=value&name2=value2 , as it appears in the first line
of the request.
No decoding is performed.
request.scheme
string
URL scheme, such as HTTP or HTTPS. All values of this attribute
are in lowercase.
request.url()
string
Convenience for host() + request.path .
This doesn't include the port and uses a host value that might
differ from the host header.
request.useragent()
string
Convenience equivalent to request.headers['user-agent'] .
Operators
Secure Web Proxy supports several operators that can be used to build complex
logic expressions from simple expression statements. Secure Web Proxy supports
logical operators, such as && , ||, and ! , and string manipulation
operators, such as x.contains('y') .
The logical operators let you verify multiple variables in a conditional
expression. For example,
request.method == 'GET' && host().matches('.*\.example.com') joins two
statements and requires both statements to be True to produce an
overall result of True .
The string manipulation operators match strings or substrings that you define,
and let you develop rules to control access to resources without listing every
possible combination.
Logical operators
The following table describes the logical operators that Secure Web Proxy
supports.
Example expression
Description
x == "foo"
Returns True if x is equal to the constant
string literal argument.
x == R"fo'o"
Returns True if x is equal to the given raw
string literal that does not interpret escape sequences. Raw string
literals are convenient for expressing strings that the code must
use to escape sequence characters.
x == y
Returns True if x is equal to
y .
x != y
Returns True if x is not equal to
y .
x && y
Returns True if both x and y
are True .
x || y
Returns True if x , y , or both
are True .
!x
Returns True if the boolean value x is
False . Otherwise, it returns False if the
boolean value x is True .
m['k']
If key k is present, returns the value at key
k in the string-to-string map m . If key
k is not present, it returns an error that
causes the rule under evaluation to not match.
String manipulation operators
The following table describes the string manipulation operators that
Secure Web Proxy supports.
Expression
Description
x.contains(y)
Returns True if the string x contains the
substring y .
x.startsWith(y)
Returns True if the string x begins with the
substring y .
x.endsWith(y)
Returns True if the string x ends with the
substring y .
x.matches(y)
Returns True if the string x matches the
specified
RE2 pattern y .
The RE2 pattern is compiled by using the RE2::Latin1 option that
disables Unicode features.
x.lower()
Returns the lowercase value of the string x .
x.upper()
Returns the uppercase value of the string x .
x + y
Returns the concatenated string xy .
int(x)
Converts the string result of x to an int
type. You can use the converted string to compare integers with
standard arithmetic operators such as > and
. This works only for integer values.
