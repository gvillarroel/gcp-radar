TLS inspection overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypted traffic accounts for the vast majority
of web traffic. Because threat actors often use these encrypted channels to hide
malicious activity, it's critical to inspect this traffic before it reaches its
destination.
Secure Web Proxy provides an integrated TLS inspection service that lets you
intercept and decrypt HTTPS traffic. By gaining visibility into the encrypted
request, Secure Web Proxy can apply advanced security policies—such as URL
filtering on the full request path and HTTP header inspection—to protect your
environment from threats hidden within encrypted tunnels.
Note: If you want to use
ApplicationMatcher in
your security rules for HTTPS traffic, then you must
enable TLS Inspection for your
Secure Web Proxy instance.
How it works
TLS inspection works by establishing two separate encrypted connections, with
Secure Web Proxy acting as a secure intermediary.
Client handshake : when a client tries to connect to an external site, such
as www.example.com , Secure Web Proxy intercepts the request.
Certificate generation : Secure Web Proxy communicates with the private
Certificate Authority Service (CA Service). The proxy generates a
temporary certificate for www.example.com in real-time, signed by your
organization's private subordinate CA.
Trust validation : the client then receives that temporary certificate.
Inspection point : traffic is decrypted within the Secure Web Proxy
instance. At this stage, security policies are applied to the plain-text HTTP
data.
Server handshake : Secure Web Proxy then initiates a second TLS
connection to the actual destination server. The traffic is re-encrypted and
sent to the destination address.
Key features
The Secure Web Proxy TLS inspection service offers a flexible, scalable
framework for managing encrypted traffic through the following capabilities:
Integrated private trust : built-in integration with CA Service
provides a highly available, Google-managed repository for your private CAs.
Flexible root of trust : use an existing on-premises root certificate
authority (CA) to sign subordinate CAs that are hosted in
CA Service. You can then generate and manage a completely new
root certificate directly within CA Service.
Specific decryption : use SessionMatcher to define precisely which
traffic to decrypt. You can trigger the TLS inspection based on the following
parameters:
Website domain names : match specific websites by using
regular expressions and domain lists.
Network criteria : target specific source IP address ranges or Classless
Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, such as 10.0.0.0/24 , to define network
boundaries.
Boolean logic : combine multiple conditions—such as a source IP
and a destination URL—to create highly specific security rules.
Scalable policy architecture :
Dedicated policies : assign a unique TLS inspection policy and CA pool to
each Secure Web Proxy policy for strict isolation.
Shared policies : simplify policy management by sharing a single TLS
inspection configuration across multiple proxy policies.
Full Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) visibility : inspect the entire URI
(including the domain, path, and query strings, such as
www.example.com/downloads/malware.exe ) rather than just the domain name.
Precise access control : use TLS inspection to enforce policies for
specific paths of a website. For example, you can allow access to
www.example.com/documentation , but block www.example.com/uploads .
Role of certificate authorities in TLS inspection
To inspect encrypted traffic, Secure Web Proxy acts as a trusted
intermediary. This involves a coordinated process between the proxy, the
CA Service, and the client device.
Client trust requirements
TLS inspection is designed for environments where an organization has
administrative control over the client devices, such as managed laptops,
servers, or virtual machines (VMs).
Private trust anchor : Because Secure Web Proxy presents certificates
that are signed by your internal CA rather than a public CA, clients trust the
connection only if your private root CA is pre-installed.
Administrative scope : Connections from unmanaged hardware typically
trigger Insecure connection warnings because these devices lack your
organization's specific trust anchor.
Handle interception failures
Even on managed devices, certain connections can't be intercepted due to
certificate pinning . Certificate pinning occurs when an application is
hardcoded to accept only a specific public key or a specific public CA chain.
Examples of certificate pinning : common services that use pinning include
Windows and macOS system updates, Google Chrome updates, and certain
high-security mobile applications.
Result of certificate pinning : when Secure Web Proxy presents its signed
certificate, the application detects that the certificate doesn't match its
hardcoded expectations and terminates the connection.
Mitigation and precise control
To prevent service disruptions for pinned applications or to maintain privacy
for sensitive websites, you can use the SessionMatcher attribute to bypass
inspection. You can restrict or skip inspection based on the following
parameters:
Destination attributes : specific fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
Source attributes : secure tags ,
service accounts , or
IP addresses .
Custom logic : use boolean expressions to exclude specific traffic while
inspecting the rest of the environment.
Certificate authority configuration methods
To enable TLS inspection, set up your certificate authority (CA) by using any of
the following methods:
Subordinate CA in CA Service : use an existing external root
CA to sign a subordinate CA stored within Google Cloud.
External root CA : use an external root CA to sign certificates that are
generated at runtime through subordinate CAs.
Google-managed root CA : generate a new root certificate directly within
CA Service to sign your subordinate CAs.
