Assign static IP addresses for outbound traffic
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
By default, Secure Web Proxy uses a managed
Cloud NAT gateway
( swg-autogen-nat ) for outbound web traffic, which typically uses automatically
allocated IP addresses. This page describes how to configure the
Cloud NAT gateway to use a specific set of static external
IPv4 addresses that you own and manage in your Google Cloud project. All
outbound traffic from your workloads that's routed through the
Secure Web Proxy then originates from one of these predefined static IPs.
Note: This setting is an advanced configuration setting for Secure Web Proxy. We
recommend that you use the process explained on this page only if it's necessary
to implement this specific setting for your workload.
Here are a few key benefits of assigning static IP addresses for your outbound
traffic:
Predictable outbound traffic source IPs : enables external services,
partners, and on-premises firewalls to add your specific IP addresses to
their authorized lists, ensuring that traffic from your Secure Web Proxy
instance is accepted. This is essential for accessing resources that are
protected by IP-based access control lists (ACLs).
Dynamic port allocation (DPA) : efficiently allocates available source
ports from the set of static IP addresses that you assign for outbound
traffic. DPA lets your workloads manage outbound traffic with a limited
number of static IPs, without using up all the available ports. For more
information, see
Dynamic port allocation .
Enhanced security posture : provides a smaller, known set of IP addresses
to manage and monitor, simplifying security audits and threat analysis.
Improved third-party integration : facilitates seamless integration with
SaaS providers and APIs that require or recommend IP allowlists for enhanced
security.
Simplified compliance : helps you meet compliance requirements for all
outbound traffic points and their associated IP addresses.
Before you begin
Complete the
initial setup steps .
Reserve a list of static IPv4 addresses to use for your Secure Web Proxy
instance. Before reserving IP addresses in Google Cloud, make sure
that you create an address resource by using the
gcloud compute addresses create command .
Verify that you have the Google Cloud CLI version 406.0.0 or later installed:
gcloud version | head -n1
If you have an earlier gcloud CLI version installed, update the version:
gcloud components update --version=406.0.0
Configure static IP addresses for Secure Web Proxy
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Nat page.
Go to Cloud Nat
Locate the Cloud NAT gateway that your Secure Web Proxy
instance uses. Its name would be swg-autogen-nat , and it would be
associated with a Cloud NAT (with a name in the
swg-autogen-router-YYYY format) in the appropriate region and
Virtual Private Cloud network.
To go to the details page of the Cloud NAT gateway, click the
swg-autogen-nat gateway name. The Cloud NAT gateway details page
opens.
Click Edit . The Edit Cloud NAT gateway page opens.
For Cloud NAT IP addresses , change the setting from
Automatic (recommended) to Manual .
For IP addresses , select the static IP addresses that you
reserved. For more information, see
Configure Cloud NAT IPs for Secure Web Proxy .
To add multiple IP addresses, click the
add_box Add IP address button.
Expand the Advanced configurations section, and then select the
Enable Dynamic Port Allocation checkbox.
For Min ports per VM , we recommend that you enter 2048 .
For Max ports per VM , we recommend that you enter 4096 .
Click Save .
After saving your changes, verify the following:
On the Cloud NAT gateway details page, check that the
IP addresses section now lists your manually selected static IP
addresses.
Check that Dynamic Port Allocation is enabled for the correct
minimum and maximum ports per virtual machine (VM) that you'd
configured earlier.
Cloud Shell
To identify the Cloud Router name that was assigned while
provisioning your Secure Web Proxy instance, use the
gcloud compute routers list command .
gcloud compute routers list \
--region REGION \
--filter="network:( NETWORK_NAME ) AND name:(swg-autogen-router-*)" \
--format="get(name)"
Replace the following:
REGION : region where the Cloud Router is
deployed for your Secure Web Proxy instance
NETWORK_NAME : name of your VPC
network
The output is similar to the following:
swg-autogen-router-1
To list the external automatically provisioned IP addresses that were
assigned while provisioning your Secure Web Proxy instance, use the
gcloud compute routers get-status command .
gcloud compute routers get-status ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION
The output is similar to the following:
kind : compute#routerStatusResponse
result :
natStatus :
- autoAllocatedNatIps :
- 34.144.80.46
- 34.144.83.75
- 34.144.88.111
- 34.144.94.113
minExtraNatIpsNeeded : 0
name : swg-autogen-nat
numVmEndpointsWithNatMappings : 3
network : https://www.googleapis.com/compute/projects/ PROJECT_NAME /global/networks/ NETWORK_NAME
This output includes the following values:
PROJECT_NAME : name of your Google Cloud
project
NETWORK_NAME : name of your VPC
network
Note: In the preceding output, the swg-autogen-nat Cloud NAT gateway
has four automatically provisioned IP addresses. The Secure Web Proxy
can scale up or scale down automatically provisioned Cloud NAT IP
addresses based on your Google Cloud workload.
To update the Cloud NAT gateway to use your predefined IP range,
use the
gcloud compute routers nats update command .
gcloud compute routers nats update swg-autogen-nat \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--nat-external-ip-pool= IPv4_ADDRESSES ... \
--region= REGION
Replace IPv4_ADDRESSES with the name of the external
IPv4 address resource that you intend to use, separated by a comma ( , ).
To verify that your IP range is assigned to the Cloud NAT
gateway, use the
gcloud compute routers nats describe command .
gcloud compute routers nats describe swg-autogen-nat \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION
The output is similar to the following:
enableEndpointIndependentMapping : false
icmpIdleTimeoutSec : 30
logConfig :
enable : false
filter : ALL
name : swg-autogen-nat
natIpAllocateOption : MANUAL_ONLY
natIps :
- https://www.googleapis.com/compute/projects/ PROJECT_NAME /regions/ REGION /addresses/ ADDRESS
sourceSubnetworkIpRangesToNat : ALL_SUBNETWORKS_ALL_IP_RANGES
This output includes the following values:
PROJECT_NAME : name of your Google Cloud
project
REGION : region where the Cloud NAT
gateway is deployed
ADDRESS : name of the static IPv4 address
resource
To update the Cloud NAT gateway to use the dynamic port
allocation (DPA) mode, use the
gcloud compute routers nats update command .
DPA mode enables your Secure Web Proxy instance to use the assigned IP
addresses.
gcloud compute routers nats update swg-autogen-nat \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--min-ports-per-vm=2048 \
--max-ports-per-vm=4096 \
--enable-dynamic-port-allocation \
--region= REGION
For the --min-ports-per-vm and --max-ports-per-vm flags, we recommend
that you set their values to 2048 and 4096 , respectively.
Use
Metrics Explorer
to monitor metrics data for the following and adjust DPA minimum and
maximum values as needed:
Cloud NAT Gateway - Port usage
Cloud NAT Gateway - New connection count
Cloud NAT Gateway - Open connections
To verify that your DPA is enabled and the minimum and maximum port values
are set, use the
gcloud compute routers nats describe command .
gcloud compute routers nats describe swg-autogen-nat \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION
Check the output for natIpAllocateOption: MANUAL_ONLY to verify that the
natIps list includes your static IP addresses.
The output is similar to the following:
enableDynamicPortAllocation : true
enableEndpointIndependentMapping : false
endpointTypes :
- ENDPOINT_TYPE_SWG
logConfig :
enable : true
filter : ERRORS_ONLY
maxPortsPerVm : 4096
minPortsPerVm : 2048
name : swg-autogen-nat
natIpAllocateOption : MANUAL_ONLY
natIps :
- https://www.googleapis.com/compute/projects/ PROJECT_NAME /regions/ REGION /addresses/ ADDRESS
sourceSubnetworkIpRangesToNat : ALL_SUBNETWORKS_ALL_IP_RANGES
type : PUBLIC
This output includes the following values:
PROJECT_NAME : name of your Google Cloud
project
REGION : region where the Cloud NAT
gateway is deployed
ADDRESS : name of the static IPv4 address
resource
