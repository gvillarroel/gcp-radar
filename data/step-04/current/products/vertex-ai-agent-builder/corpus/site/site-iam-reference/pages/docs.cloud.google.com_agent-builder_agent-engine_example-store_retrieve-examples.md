This feature is

Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.

launch stage descriptions .
This page shows you how to retrieve examples from your Example Store.
You have the following options for retrieving your examples:
FetchExamples : Retrieves all examples that exactly fit your filtering criteria. Use this option when you just have a few examples or need lower latency.
SearchExamples : Retrieves examples using similarity search between your user query and your stored examples. Use this option if you have a large number of examples.
Prerequisites
Before you use the Python samples on this page, install and initialize the
Vertex AI SDK for Python in your local Python environment.
Run the following command to install the Vertex AI SDK for Python for Example Store.
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-aiplatform> = 1 .87.0
Use the following code sample to import and initialize the SDK for Example Store.
import vertexai
from vertexai.preview import example_stores
vertexai . init (
project = " PROJECT_ID " ,
location = " LOCATION "
)
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
LOCATION : Your region. Only us-central1 is supported.
Fetch examples
Use the following samples to fetch examples. FetchExamples retrieves all examples that exactly fit your filtering criteria.
Vertex AI SDK for Python
The following code returns all examples in your Example Store, up to 100 per page:
from vertexai.preview import example_stores
example_store = example_stores . ExampleStore ( EXAMPLE_STORE_NAME )
# Returns the dictionary representation of FetchExamplesResponse.
examples = example_store . fetch_examples ()
You can use function_names to specify one or more filters that restrict which examples are returned. The following example only returns examples that include the functions flight_booking_tool and hotel_booking_tool :
# Returns examples that include either tool.
example_store . fetch_examples (
filter = {
"function_names" : {
"values" : [ "flight_booking_tool" , "hotel_booking_tool" ],
"array_operator" : "CONTAINS_ANY"
}
}
)
# Returns examples that include *both* tools.
example_store . fetch_examples (
filter = {
"function_names" : {
"values" : [ "flight_booking_tool" , "hotel_booking_tool" ],
"array_operator" : "CONTAINS_ALL"
}
}
)
You can use the search_keys filter to restrict which examples are returned by their search key.
# Returns examples that include any of the following search keys.
example_store . fetch_examples (
filter = { "search_keys" : [ "How do I get to the airport?" ]}
)
You can use the example_ids filter to restrict which examples are returned by their Example ID. Example IDs use the format exampleTypes/stored_contents_example/examples/<var>EXAMPLE_ID</var> , where EXAMPLE_ID represents the numerical ID generated for the example.
# Returns examples that have any of the following Example IDs.
example_store . fetch_examples (
example_ids = [ "exampleTypes/stored_contents_example/examples/09b1d383f92c47e7a2583a44ebbc7854" ]
)
REST API
To fetch examples, send a POST request by using the exampleStores.fetchExamples method.
The function_names filter specified in the example request JSON body only returns examples that include the functions flight_booking_tool and hotel_booking_tool :
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your project ID.
LOCATION : The region where you want to create the example
store. The only region supported is us-central1 .
EXAMPLE_STORE_ID : The ID of the Example Store
instance where you want to upload the example.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https:// LOCATION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /exampleStores/ EXAMPLE_STORE_ID :fetchExamples
Request JSON body:
{
"stored_contents_example_filter": {
"function_names": {
"values": ["flight_booking_tool", "hotel_booking_tool"],
"array_operator": "CONTAINS_ANY"
}
}
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https:// LOCATION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /exampleStores/ EXAMPLE_STORE_ID :fetchExamples"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https:// LOCATION -aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /exampleStores/ EXAMPLE_STORE_ID :fetchExamples" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following, where EXAMPLE_ID
represents the ID generated for the example.
Response
{'examples': [{'exampleId': 'exampleTypes/stored_contents_example/examples/ EXAMPLE_ID ',
'storedContentsExample': {'searchKey': 'What is the weather like in Boston?',

Search examples
Example Store finds the most relevant examples based on the similarity score between the stored_contents_example_key and the stored examples' search keys. Using examples that are relevant to the conversation helps the model learn the expected behavior.
Vertex AI SDK for Python
Use the following code sample to search for relevant examples using the Vertex AI SDK for Python:
example_store . search_examples (
parameters = {
"stored_contents_example_key" : "what's the weather in nyc"
},
# Only fetch the most similar examaple. The default value is 3.
top_k = 1
)
"""
Response -- dictionary representation of SearchExamplesResponse.
{'results': [{'example': {'exampleId': 'exampleTypes/stored_contents_example/examples/16834837b178453783e471b459d99195',
'storedContentsExample': {'searchKey': 'What is the weather like in Boston?',
'contentsExample': {'contents': [{'role': 'user',
'parts': [{'text': 'What is the weather like in Boston?'}]}],
'expectedContents': [{'content': {'parts': [{'functionCall': {'name': 'get_current_weather',
'args': {'location': 'New York, NY'}}}]}},
{'content': {'parts': [{'functionResponse': {'name': 'get_current_weather',
'response': {'humidity': 65.0,
'description': 'Partly Cloudy',
'icon': 'partly-cloudy',

{'content': {'role': 'model',
'parts': [{'text': 'The weather in Boston is 38 degrees and partly cloudy.'}]}}]}}},
'similarityScore': 0.73527116}]}
"""
You can use the function_names filter to restrict which examples are included in the similarity search.
example_store . search_examples (
parameters = {
"stored_contents_example_key" : "What's the weather in nyc" ,
"function_names" : {
"values" : [ "weather_tool" , "hotel_booking_tool" ],
"array_operator" : "CONTAINS_ANY"
