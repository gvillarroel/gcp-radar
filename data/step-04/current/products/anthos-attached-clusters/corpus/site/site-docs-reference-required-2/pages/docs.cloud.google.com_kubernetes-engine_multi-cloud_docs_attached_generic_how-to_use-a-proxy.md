Proxy support for CNCF conformant attached clusters
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
If your organization uses an HTTP proxy for internet traffic, you need to
configure GKE attached clusters accordingly. This document describes how to perform
this configuration.
Before you begin
GKE attached clusters requires connectivity to various Google Cloud services. Make
sure your proxy server allows traffic to the following domains:
.gcr.io
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
container.googleapis.com
gkeconnect.googleapis.com
gkehub.googleapis.com
oauth2.googleapis.com
securetoken.googleapis.com
storage.googleapis.com
sts.googleapis.com
www.googleapis.com
servicecontrol.googleapis.com
logging.googleapis.com
monitoring.googleapis.com
opsconfigmonitoring.googleapis.com
GCP_LOCATION -gkemulticloud.googleapis.com
Replace GCP_LOCATION with the Google Cloud region in
which your cluster resides. Specify us-west1 or another
supported region .
Configure proxy support for GKE attached clusters
To configure proxy support for GKE attached clusters, follow these
steps:
Create a proxy configuration file which contains values for httpProxy ,
noProxy , and httpsProxy keys:
{
"httpProxy" : HTTP_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_URL ,
"httpsProxy" : HTTPS_PROXY_AUTH_URL ,
"noProxy" : NO_PROXY_ADDRESSES
}
Replace the following:
HTTP_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_URL : the proxy server
URL, which consists of a hostname/IP address, and optionally a port,
username, and password. For example: http://user:password@192.0.2.0:80 or
just 198.51.100.255 .
HTTPS_PROXY_AUTH_URL : the proxy URL for encrypted
HTTPS traffic, which consists of a hostname/IP address, and optionally a
port, username, and password.
NO_PROXY_ADDRESSES : a comma-separated list of
URLs, CIDR blocks, and DNS names of resources that can bypass the proxy.
This directs GKE attached clusters to avoid using the proxy for the specified
resources. Keep in mind the following:
Values can be individual IP addresses, CIDR ranges, domain names, or
even the asterix character (*). Using a single asterix ( * ) in the
noProxy field tells GKE attached clusters to skip the proxy for all traffic.
A domain leading with a dot, such as .google.com , targets all its
subdomains. For example, .google.com includes addresses such as
mail.google.com and drive.google.com , but excludes google.com .
Ensure that you include kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local and
kubernetes.default.svc domains for proper logging. Here's an example:
198.51.100.0,192.0.2.0/16,examplepetstore.com,.altostrat.com,kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local, kubernetes.default.svc .
When creating the proxy configuration file, adhere to the following
guidelines:
The httpProxy and httpsProxy fields don't accept https:// prefixes.
Use http:// , even if the real proxy server address begins with https:// .
For example, represent https://proxy.example.com:3128 as
http://proxy.example.com:3128 .
It's compulsory to provide values for all three fields: httpProxy ,
httpsProxy , and noProxy .
Consider appending additional domains, IP addresses, or CIDRs to the
noProxy list. We recommend that you include the VPC IP range.
Create a Kubernetes Secret, which contains the proxy configuration, by
running the following command:
kubectl create secret generic SECRET_NAME \
--from-file = PROXY_CONFIGURATION_FILE
Replace the following:
SECRET_NAME : the name of the Kubernetes Secret
PROXY_CONFIGURATION_FILE : the path to the proxy
configuration you created in step 1.
Mark the Kubernetes Secret as
immutable
by setting its immutable field to true :
kubectl edit secret SECRET_NAME
Replace SECRET_NAME with the name of the Kubernetes
Secret.
Configure a new or existing cluster to use the proxy:
New cluster
To register a new cluster and apply the proxy configuration, use the
gcloud container attached clusters register command . Make sure to provide the optional arguments
--proxy-secret-name and --proxy-secret-namespace :
gcloud container attached clusters register CLUSTER_NAME \
--proxy-secret-name = SECRET_NAME \
--proxy-secret-namespace = SECRET_NAMESPACE
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster
SECRET_NAME : the name of the Kubernetes Secret
containing the proxy configuration
SECRET_NAMESPACE : the Kubernetes namespace where
the Secret is stored
For information about all the arguments you can use when registering a
cluster, see the
gcloud container attached clusters register command .
Existing cluster
To update a previously registered cluster with a new proxy configuration,
use the
gcloud container attached clusters update command . Make sure to provide the optional arguments --proxy-secret-name
and --proxy-secret-namespace :
gcloud container attached clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
--proxy-secret-name = SECRET_NAME \
--proxy-secret-namespace = SECRET_NAMESPACE
Replace the following:
CLUSTER_NAME : the name of the cluster
SECRET_NAME : the name of the Kubernetes Secret
containing the proxy configuration
SECRET_NAMESPACE : the Kubernetes namespace where
the Secret is stored
This step is required if your proxy server details have changed, or if an
initial cluster registration overlooked proxy requirements.
For information about all the arguments you can use when updating a
cluster, see the
gcloud container attached clusters update command .
After performing these steps, GKE attached clusters processes outbound internet
traffic using the proxy server specified in the configuration file.
