Install Cloud Logging on AKS attached clusters
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes how GKE attached clusters integrates with
Cloud Logging and shows you how to access your logs.
Overview
GKE attached clusters supports Cloud Logging for workloads
and for system components running on worker nodes.
GKE attached clusters includes a
Fluentbit -based logging agent that runs on
worker nodes as a Daemonset. Data collected by the logging agents can be
managed and deleted like any other metric and log data, as described in
Cloud Logging
documentation.
Before you begin
Fulfill the
prerequisites for GKE attached clusters .
Authorize Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring
to set up permissions for Google Cloud Observability.
What data is collected
You can configure GKE attached clusters to capture any or all of the following
information:
Logs for workloads
Enable logging
If you don't specify a logging mode when you attach your cluster,
GKE attached clusters enables system logging by default. For workload
logging, your cluster must be at Kubernetes version 1.23 or later.
To enable workload logging when attaching a cluster, follow the instructions
to attach your AKS cluster , and
include the optional --logging flag in the
gcloud container attached clusters register command :
gcloud container attached clusters register CLUSTER_NAME
...
--logging= LOGGING_FLAG
To enable workload logging on a cluster that's already attached, follow the
instructions to
update your AKS cluster , and
include the optional --logging flag in the
gcloud container attached clusters update command :
gcloud container attached clusters update CLUSTER_NAME
...
--logging= LOGGING_FLAG
Replace LOGGING_FLAG with a flag indicating what kind of
logging you want to enable:
NONE : disable logging.
SYSTEM : enable logging of system workloads running in
specific namespaces.
SYSTEM,WORKLOAD : enable logging of both system and workload activity on your
cluster's worker nodes.
Access your logs
There are several ways to access your GKE attached clusters logs in
Cloud Logging:
Logs Explorer – You can see your logs directly from the
Logs Explorer by using the
logging filters to select the Kubernetes resources, such as
cluster, node, namespace, pod, or container logs.
Google Cloud CLI – Using the
gcloud logging read command,
select the appropriate cluster, node, pod, and container logs.
Understanding your logs
A log in Cloud Logging is a collection of
log entries , and each log entry
applies to a certain type of
logging resource .
Resource types
These are the resource types that are specific to GKE attached clusters:
Resource type
Display name
k8s_container
Workload container logs
When GKE attached clusters writes your cluster's logs, each log entry includes
the resource type. Understanding where logs appear makes it easier to find logs
when you need them.
System apps logs
System apps logs fall under the k8s_container resource type. These include
logs from pods installed on the worker nodes by GKE attached clusters.
Specifically, containers running in the following namespaces are included:
gke-connect
gke-system
gmp-system
asm-user-auth
cnrm-system
config-management-system
gatekeeper-system
gmp-public
istio-system
knative-serving
Find your logs in the Cloud Logging user interface
You can view your logs using the
Logs Explorer in the
Cloud Logging user interface.
Logs Explorer
Using the Query Builder, you can build a query by adding query parameters
manually. For example, if you want to explore logs for system workloads, you can
start with selecting or searching for the k8s_container resource type, and
then select the location and cluster name. You can then refine your search by
filtering the container or Pod names.
The Logs Explorer offers an additional way to build your search queries
using the Logs field explorer . It shows the count of log entries, sorted by
decreasing count, for the given log field. Using the Logs field explorer is
particularly useful for GKE attached clusters logs because it provides an easy
way to select the Kubernetes values for your resources. For example, you can
select logs for a specific cluster, Namespace, Pod name, and container name.
For more information, see
Using the Logs Explorer .
Sample queries
This section includes sample queries that you can make on Logs Explorer.
Example 1: Get the logs of the gke-connect-agent container for an
Google Cloud cluster CLUSTER_NAME :
resource.type = "k8s_container"
resource.labels.cluster_name = "attachedClusters/ CLUSTER_NAME "
resource.labels.container_name = "gke-connect-agent"
