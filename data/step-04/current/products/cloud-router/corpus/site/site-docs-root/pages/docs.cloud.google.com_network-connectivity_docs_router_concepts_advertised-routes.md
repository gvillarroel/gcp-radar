Advertised routes
Advertised routes are Cloud Router BGP prefixes advertised to its BGP peers
(for example, an on-premises router). Cloud Router can advertise the
following routes:
Local subnet ranges
NCC-imported subnet ranges
NCC-imported transit dynamic routes
Custom IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes
Advertisement modes
The advertisement mode of a Cloud Router controls whether it
advertises subnet routes, custom prefixes, or both. The advertisement mode is
configurable on both the Cloud Router level and BGP session level.
The router's advertisement mode doesn't control whether
NCC-imported transit dynamic routes are re-advertised. See
Re-advertising NCC-imported transit dynamic
routes for details about those routes.
Cloud Router offers two advertisement modes defined at the router
level:
Cloud Router default advertisement mode
Advertises subnet ranges as described in Subnet range
advertisement .
Cloud Router custom advertisement mode
Gives you complete control over IP address advertisements as described in
Custom advertisement .
Cloud Router also offers two advertisement modes defined at the BGP
session level:
BGP session default advertisement mode
Advertises prefixes according to the advertisement mode defined at the router
level for the Cloud Router that contains the BGP session.
BGP session custom advertisement mode
Gives you complete control over IP address advertisements as described in
Custom advertisement .
Effective advertisements
The following table describes how router level and BGP session level
advertisement modes interact to produce the effective advertisement behavior of
the BGP session:

The BGP session doesn't inherit the advertisement configuration of
the Cloud Router. The BGP session advertises prefixes as
described in Custom advertisement .
Subnet range advertisement
A BGP session can advertise the following subnet ranges:
Local IPv4 subnet ranges: subnet ranges in the same VPC network
that contains the Cloud Router.
NCC-imported IPv4 subnet ranges: if the Cloud Router
is in a hybrid spoke whose import filter allows it to receive subnet routes
from an NCC hub. For more information, see Hybrid spokes and
NCC-imported subnet route
advertisement .
Local IPv6 subnet ranges: advertising subnet IPv6 address ranges has
additional requirements described in Advertising subnet IPv6 address
ranges .
Cloud Router automatically updates subnet route advertisements whenever
a subnet lifecycle activity occurs.
Effect of dynamic routing mode
The dynamic routing mode of a VPC network controls which subnet
routes its Cloud Routers advertise.
Regional dynamic routing mode
Each BGP session that advertises subnet ranges only sends the subnet ranges
that are in the same region as the Cloud Router that contains the
BGP session. The advertised MED matches the configured base priority of the
BGP session.
Global dynamic routing mode
Each BGP session that advertises subnet ranges sends both the subnet ranges
that are in the same region as the Cloud Router that contains the BGP
session and subnet ranges in other regions. The advertised MED of subnet
ranges in the same region as the Cloud Router matches the configured
base priority of the BGP session. The advertised MED of subnet ranges in
different regions is the sum of the configured base priority of the BGP session
and an inter-regional cost.
Advertising privately used public IPv4 address ranges
Subnet IPv4 address ranges can include privately used public IPv4 address
ranges . If you advertise privately used public
IPv4 addresses to another network, that other network might not be able to
access internet resources at those public IPv4 addresses.
Advertising subnet IPv6 address ranges
Subnet route advertisement automatically includes internal subnet
IPv6 ranges when both of the
following conditions are met:
The product used with Cloud Router, such as the
HA VPN gateway, is configured to use the IPv4 and IPv6
(dual-stack) or the IPv6-only (single stack) stack types.
The IPv6 BGP session is configured and enabled or the IPv4 BGP session is
specifically configured to enable IPv6 route exchange.
Subnet route advertisement never includes advertisement of external subnet IPv6
address ranges . However, you can include
external IPv6 address ranges as custom IP address ranges when using custom
advertisement .
For more information about configuring BGP sessions, see
Establish BGP sessions .
Custom advertisement
Custom advertisement mode gives you control over the prefixes that a BGP
session advertises. You can use Cloud Router custom advertisement mode
or per-BGP-session custom advertisement mode to advertise routes that include
default route prefixes, such as 0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4 routes or ::/0 for IPv6
routes, for all BGP sessions on a Cloud Router.
When you configure custom advertisement mode, you select one of the following
options:
Advertise only custom IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes : this option advertises
only the IP address ranges you specify, omitting subnet ranges. The
advertised MED always matches the configured base priority of the BGP
session.
Advertise custom IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes in addition to subnet ranges :
this option advertises subnet ranges in addition to the custom IP address
ranges you specify. With this option, note the following:
Which subnet ranges are advertised and their advertised MEDs depends on
the dynamic routing mode of the VPC network that contains
the Cloud Router, as described in Subnet range
advertisement .
The advertised MED of each custom IP address range always matches the
configured base priority of the BGP session. The dynamic routing mode has
no effect on the advertised MED for custom IP address ranges.
A custom IP address range is ignored if it exactly matches a subnet route
that a Cloud Router advertises according to the dynamic
routing mode of its VPC network.
Re-advertising NCC-imported transit dynamic routes
Re-advertising transit dynamic routes is controlled exclusively by these hybrid
spoke settings:
The site-to-site data transfer
option
The hybrid spoke export filters
The hybrid spoke import filters
See Hybrid spokes and NCC-imported dynamic route
re-advertisement
for more information.
Advertised priority
On a per-BGP session basis, you define a base advertised
priority that is used as a value for the
BGP MED attribute.
Cloud Router advertises the following prefixes using only the
configured base advertised priority:
Custom IP address ranges when the
effective advertisements for the BGP session are
set to custom advertisement.
Subnet ranges of subnets in the same region as the Cloud Router
when the effective advertisements for the BGP
session includes subnet range advertisement .
Cloud Router uses the configured base advertised priority plus an
inter-regional cost to advertise subnet ranges that come from regions that
don't match the region of the Cloud Router when both of the following
conditions are met:
The dynamic routing mode of VPC network that contains the
Cloud Router is global dynamic routing mode.
The effective advertisements for the BGP session includes subnet range
advertisement.
BGP attributes for advertised prefixes
When a Cloud Router advertises prefixes to a BGP peer, it advertises
the MED value and fills the MED attribute with a value based on the
Cloud Router's internal priority for each prefix in the advertisement,
or the BGP message. The advertised priority is implemented as a multi-exit discriminator.
You can control what prefixes Cloud Router
advertises to all or some of its BGP
sessions. To adjust the advertised priority, you can update the base route
priority for the prefixes that is added
to MED. This doesn't work for site-to-site re-advertisement. If you need
finer-grained control, you can apply BGP route
policies .
When your on-premises routers receive the advertised prefixes and their
MED attributes, they create routes that are used to send packets to your
VPC network.
Note: To help ensure 99.99% availability SLA when configuring
HA VPN, Partner Interconnect, or
Dedicated Interconnect, make sure that your Cloud Router
advertises the same prefixes on all links, possibly with different priorities.
Region-to-region costs can periodically change based on factors such as network
performance. These changes can affect how packets are routed. If you notice
routing changes, it might be due to updated region-to-region costs.
Caution:
The route selection process in the on-premises network might not prioritize
the lower-MED route. Because other attributes (such as router ID or origin
ASN) can affect how the BGP best path selection works, see your device
documentation.
For example, see the following resources:
Cisco:
BGP Path Selection
Fortinet:
BGP Handbook
Juniper:
BGP Path Selection
Route metric examples
This section provides examples that show how region-to-region costs influence
advertised MEDs when you use global dynamic routing.
HA VPNs with active-active tunnels
In this example, suppose that you have a VPC network with the
following configuration:
A subnet in each of the following regions: us-central1 , europe-west1 ,
and us-west-1
One Cloud Router that manages two BGP sessions for two
HA VPN tunnels in us-central1
One Cloud Router that manages two BGP sessions for two
HA VPN tunnels in us-west1
The following diagram shows this example, including sample values for
region-to-region costs:
HA VPNs with active-active tunnels (click to enlarge).
Assume that each BGP session has the default base priority of 100 .
The following tables show how base priority and region-to-region costs are used
to calculate the advertised MED values for traffic from your on-premises network
to each subnet.
10.0.1.0/24
The following table shows the BGP sessions that advertise subnet IPv4
address range 10.0.1.0/24 , which is located in
us-central1 .

HA VPNs with active-passive tunnels
This example uses the same topology as in the previous example, but with the
following modified base priorities to achieve an active-passive
HA VPN tunnel pair in each region:
A primary tunnel whose BGP session has the default base priority of 100
A secondary tunnel whose BGP session has a lower priority of 351
The following tables show how base priority and region-to-region cost are used
to calculate the advertised MED values for traffic from your on-premises network
to each subnet.

Globally preferred Dedicated Interconnect
This example is similar to the previous examples, except that the two
Cloud VPN tunnels in the us-west1 region are replaced with two VLAN
attachments.
The following diagram shows this example:
Globally preferred Dedicated Interconnect (click to enlarge).
Suppose that you want to prioritize the VLAN attachments. You specify larger
base priorities for the HA VPN tunnels in the us-central1
region to deprioritize them.
The following tables show how base priority and region-to-region cost are used
to calculate the advertised MED values for traffic from your on-premises network
to each subnet.
