Establish BGP sessions
Cloud Router uses Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to exchange routes
between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network and a remote network. On
Cloud Router, you configure an interface and a BGP peer for your
on-premises router. The interface and BGP peer configuration together form a
BGP session.
Within Google Cloud, a Cloud Router interface connects to exactly
one of the following Google Cloud resources:
An HA VPN tunnel (using dynamic routing as required)
A VLAN attachment for Cloud Interconnect
A Router appliance instance using Network Connectivity Center
A Cloud Router supports multiple interfaces. You don't need to
create a separate Cloud Router for each Cloud VPN tunnel or
VLAN attachment. However, each Cloud Router uses the same ASN for all
its BGP sessions. Because Partner Interconnect requires a public
ASN, and all other types of interface require private ASNs, a
Cloud Router that manages BGP sessions for a VLAN attachment on
Partner Interconnect cannot manage BGP sessions for any other
type of interface.
Supported BGP sessions
Cloud Router supports two types of BGP sessions:
IPv4 BGP sessions
IPv6 BGP sessions
IPv4 BGP sessions
By default, when you create a BGP session in Cloud Router, you
create an IPv4 BGP session. The IPv4 BGP session, by default,
exchanges only IPv4 routes.
However, you can configure the IPv4 BGP session to exchange IPv6 routes by using
multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) . You
might do this, for example, to exchange IPv6 traffic between your dual-stack
Virtual Private Cloud subnets and the IPv6-addressed hosts in your other network.
To enable IPv6 route exchange on your IPv4 BGP session, you need to configure a
IPv4 and IPv6 (dual stack) HA VPN tunnel or
Dedicated Interconnect VLAN attachment.
Then you can enable IPv6 route exchange in your BGP peer.
For more information, see Configure multiprotocol BGP for IPv4 or IPv6 BGP
sessions .
IPv6 BGP sessions
You can also create an IPv6 BGP session in Cloud Router.
By default, an IPv6 BGP session exchanges only IPv6 routes. Similar to IPv4 BGP
sessions, you can also configure an IPv6 BGP session with multiprotocol BGP
(MP-BGP). However, with MP-BGP over IPv6 BGP sessions, you exchange IPv4 routes
over an IPv6 BGP session.
To enable IPv4 route exchange in your IPv6 BGP session,
you need to configure a dual-stack HA VPN tunnel or
Dedicated Interconnect VLAN attachment.
Then you can enable IPv4 route exchange in your BGP peer.
For more information, see Configure multiprotocol BGP IPv4 or IPv6 BGP
sessions .
You can also establish both an IPv4 BGP session and an IPv6 BGP session
in parallel.
Each session exchanges only routes for its own
address family. IPv4 BGP sessions only exchange IPv4 routes, and IPv6
BGP sessions only exchange IPv6 routes.
You can't use MP-BGP in individual BGP sessions.
You configure these BGP sessions by assigning two interfaces on
Cloud Router, one IPv4 and one IPv6, to the same HA VPN
tunnel or Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachment. You can only configure
these BGP sessions for a dual-stack HA VPN tunnel or a
dual-stack Dedicated Interconnect VLAN attachment.
This configuration ensures that the BGP sessions share the same fate with the
dataplane and stay synchronized correctly with the status of the routes in
terms of availability.
To illustrate the benefit of this parallel BGP session configuration,
take the following example.
Suppose the dataplane experiences an IPv4-only traffic outage.
With a parallel BGP session configuration, the IPv4 BGP session drops, which
results in all IPv4 routes being withdrawn for this HA VPN
tunnel or Dedicated Interconnect VLAN attachment. This
withdrawal of IPv4 routes allows IPv4 traffic to be re-routed if possible.
The IPv6 traffic, however, continues to use this HA VPN
tunnel or Dedicated Interconnect VLAN attachment.
In the same situation, an IPv4 BGP session with MP-BGP withdraws the IPv4
routes, but also withdraws the IPv6 routes. This result is undesirable because
the session can re-route or drop IPv6 traffic unnecessarily even though the IPv6
routes are still valid. An IPv6 BGP session with MP-BGP does not go down and
does not withdraw any routes, either IPv4 or IPv6. Subsequently, only IPv4
traffic drops.
Limitations
Cloud Router has the following limitations:
iBGP between Cloud Routers in a single region doesn't work.
Although you can create two Cloud Routers with the same ASN, iBGP
isn't supported.
You can't send and learn MED values over a Layer 3
Partner Interconnect connection.
If you are using a Partner Interconnect connection where a Layer 3 service
provider handles BGP for you, Cloud Router can't learn MED values from your
on-premises router or send MED values to that router. This is because MED values can't pass
through autonomous systems. Over this type of connection, you can't set route priorities
for routes advertised by Cloud Router to your on-premises router. In addition,
you can't set route priorities for routes advertised by your on-premises router to your
VPC network.
BGP authentication
When you configure BGP for some hybrid connectivity resources, you can
optionally configure the router's peering sessions to use MD5 authentication.
For a list of products that support MD5 authentication, see
Use MD5 authentication .
BGP peering addresses
BGP sessions for the following products use IPv4 link-local
addresses in the 169.254.0.0/16 range as BGP peering addresses:
For Dedicated Interconnect, you can either specify candidate
IPv4 link-local addresses for BGP peering addresses, or Google Cloud
can select unused IPv4 link-local addresses automatically.
For Partner Interconnect, Google Cloud selects
unused IPv4 link-local addresses automatically.
For HA VPN using
dynamic routing, you can specify candidate IPv4 link-local addresses for the
BGP peering addresses.
Router appliances use internal IPv4 addresses of Google Cloud VMs as
BGP addresses. For details, see Create Router appliance
instances .
Cloud Router also supports IPv6 addresses for BGP peering. With the
configuration of IPv6 BGP peers, you can create IPv6 BGP sessions over
HA VPN tunnels and Dedicated Interconnect VLAN
attachments.
For HA VPN tunnels, you can use IPv6 unique local
addresses (ULA) in the fdff:1::/64 range as the BGP peering addresses.
The peering addresses for IPv6 BGP sessions must use a mask length of 126 or
a lower bit-count value, such as /122 .
When you configure an IPv6 BGP session in HA VPN, you can
configure the peering IPv6 addresses manually or have Google Cloud assign
them automatically for you.
For Dedicated Interconnect, the peering IPv6 addresses are
automatically assigned from the Google-owned global unicast address (GUA) range
2600:2d00:0:1::/64 . You can't specify a candidate range for these peering IPv6
addresses or configure these peering IPv6 addresses manually.
