Set routing and best path selection modes
The following Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network settings control how all
Cloud Routers work within the network:
Advertised routes are controlled by the dynamic routing mode of the
VPC network.
Learned routes are controlled by both the dynamic routing mode and the
best path selection mode of the VPC network.
The dynamic routing mode of a VPC network is either regional
(default) or global .
The best path selection mode of a VPC network is either legacy
(default) or standard . As a best practice, we recommend using legacy best path
selection mode for critical workloads.
For more information about best path selection modes, see Best path
selection .
You can specify the dynamic routing mode and the best path selection mode when
you create a VPC network, or when you update a VPC
network.
View a VPC network's dynamic routing and best path selection modes
To view the current dynamic routing mode and best path selection mode of a
VPC network, follow these steps.
Console
Note: Google Cloud console only shows a network's dynamic routing mode.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC networks
page.
Go to VPC networks
To view a network's details page, click the network's name.
In the Dynamic routing mode section, the value indicates the
type of dynamic routing mode, either Regional or Global .
In the * Best path selection mode section, the value indicates the
type of best path selection mode, either Standard or Legacy .
gcloud
Run the gcloud compute networks describe
command :
gcloud compute networks describe NETWORK_NAME \
--format = "get(routingConfig)" \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
NETWORK_NAME : the name of the VPC
network
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that contains the
VPC network
In the output, see the following:
The routingMode is the dynamic routing mode of the VPC
network. Its value is either REGIONAL or GLOBAL .
The bgpBestPathSelectionMode is the best path selection mode of the
VPC network. Its value is either LEGACY or STANDARD .
If the best path selection mode ( bgpBestPathSelectionMode ) is
STANDARD , the output might contain the following additional items:
bgpAlwaysCompareMed : Values are either True or False . If
bgpAlwaysCompareMed isn't included in the output, the implied default
value is False .
bgpInterRegionCost : Values are either DEFAULT or ADD_COST_TO_MED .
If bgpInterRegionCost isn't included in the output, the implied
default value is DEFAULT .
API
Use the
networks.get method :
GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ NETWORK_NAME
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that contains the
VPC network
NETWORK_NAME : the name of the VPC
network
In the output, see the following:
routingMode is the dynamic routing mode of the VPC
network. Its value is either REGIONAL or GLOBAL .
bgpBestPathSelectionMode is the best path selection mode of the
VPC network. Its value is either LEGACY or STANDARD .
If the best path selection mode, bgpBestPathSelectionMode , is
STANDARD , the output might contain the following additional items:
bgpAlwaysCompareMed : Values are either True or False . If
bgpAlwaysCompareMed isn't included in the output, the implied default
value is False .
bgpInterRegionCost : Values are either DEFAULT or ADD_COST_TO_MED .
If bgpInterRegionCost isn't included in the output, the implied
default value is DEFAULT .
Change a VPC network's dynamic routing and best path selection modes
To change either the current dynamic routing mode, best path selection mode, or
both of a VPC network, follow these steps.
Console
Note: The Google Cloud console only supports setting or changing a network's
dynamic routing mode.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC networks
page.
Go to VPC networks
To view a network's details page, click the network's name.
To modify the network, click edit Edit .
In the Dynamic routing mode section, select Regional or
Global .
In the Best path selection mode section, select Legacy or
Standard .
If you select standard best path selection mode, then you can do the
following:
Choose if Always compare MED is enabled:
If selected, always compares MED values without considering ASN
values.
If not selected, compares MED values within each neighbor's ASN
values.
For Inter region cost , you can select the following:
Default : doesn't add inter-region costs to MED values.
Add cost to MED : adds inter-region costs to MED values.
To confirm, click Save .
gcloud
To set the dynamic routing and best path selection modes when creating a
new VPC network, use the gcloud compute networks
create command :
gcloud compute networks create NETWORK_NAME \
--bgp-routing-mode = DYNAMIC_ROUTING_MODE \
--bgp-best-path-selection-mode = BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE \
--project = PROJECT_ID
To change the dynamic routing and best path selection modes for an existing
VPC network, use the gcloud compute networks
update command :
gcloud compute networks update NETWORK_NAME \
--bgp-routing-mode = DYNAMIC_ROUTING_MODE \
--bgp-best-path-selection-mode = BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE \
--project = PROJECT_ID
If you set --bgp-best-path-selection-mode=STANDARD , you can also use the
--bgp-bps-always-compare-med , --no-bgp-bps-always-compare-med , or
--bgp-bps-inter-region-cost flag. In the following example, you specify
either create or update :
gcloud compute networks { create | update } NETWORK_NAME \
--bgp-routing-mode = DYNAMIC_ROUTING_MODE \
--bgp-best-path-selection-mode = STANDARD \
-- [ no- ] bgp-bps-always-compare-med \
--bgp-bps-inter-region-cost = COST_MODE \
--project = PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
NETWORK_NAME : the name of the VPC
network to modify
DYNAMIC_ROUTING_MODE : the dynamic routing mode to
use—specify REGIONAL or GLOBAL . The default value is REGIONAL .
BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE : the best path selection mode
to use—specify LEGACY or STANDARD . The default value is
LEGACY .
The following are only applicable when using STANDARD best path
selection mode. These flags must be omitted if you use LEGACY best path
selection mode.
--bgp-bps-always-compare-med : use this flag to always compare MED
without considering the neighbor ASN values.
--no-bgp-bps-always-compare-med : use this flag to conditionally
compare MED values within each neighbor ASN.
COST_MODE : controls whether an inter-region cost
is added to the received MED value—specify DEFAULT or
ADD-COST-TO-MED .
DEFAULT doesn't add inter-region costs to MED values.
ADD-COST-TO-MED adds inter-region costs to MED values.
API
To set the dynamic routing and best path selection modes when creating a new
VPC network, use the networks.insert
method :
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ NETWORK_NAME
{
"routingConfig": {
"routingMode": " DYNAMIC_ROUTING_MODE "
"bgpBestPathSelectionMode": " BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE "
"bgpAlwaysCompareMed": True | False
"bgpInterRegionCost": " COST "
}
}
To change the dynamic routing and best path selection modes for an existing
VPC network, use the
networks.patch method :
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/ NETWORK_NAME
{
"routingConfig": {
"routingMode": " DYNAMIC_ROUTING_MODE "
"bgpBestPathSelectionMode": " BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE "
"bgpAlwaysCompareMed": True | False
"bgpInterRegionCost": " COST "
}
}
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the project that contains the
VPC network to modify
NETWORK_NAME : the name of the VPC
network to modify
DYNAMIC_ROUTING_MODE : the dynamic routing mode to
use—specify REGIONAL or GLOBAL . The default value is REGIONAL .
BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE : the best path selection mode
to use—specify LEGACY or STANDARD . The default value is
LEGACY .
COST : controls whether an inter-region cost is added to
the received MED value—specify DEFAULT or ADD-COST-TO-MED .
DEFAULT does not add inter-region costs to MED values.
ADD-COST-TO-MED adds inter-region costs to MED values.
When bgpAlwaysCompareMed is True , always compare MED without considering
the neighbor ASN values. When False , conditionally compare MED values
within each neighbor ASN. The default is False . bgpAlwaysCompareMed is
optional when bgpBestPathSelectionMode is STANDARD but must be
omitted when bgpBestPathSelectionMode is LEGACY .
When bgpBestPathSelectionMode is STANDARD , bgpInterRegionCost is
optional but must be omitted when bgpBestPathSelectionMode is LEGACY .
