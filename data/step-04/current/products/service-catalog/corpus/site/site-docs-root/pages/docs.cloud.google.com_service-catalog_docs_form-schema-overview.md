Overview of Form Schema
In Service Catalog, one type of supported solution is
Deployment Manager configurations. To help you create and deploy
Deployment Manager configurations, we have Form Schema.
Form Schema is used for laying out user interface (UI) components in an HTML
form. Specifically, it allows cloud admins and developers to provide a UI for
entering parameters when creating a new instance or cloud deployment.
Cloud admins use Form Schema to create forms that allow users to customize
Deployment Manager template-based solutions before launching the
solutions. For example, users can select the machine type, disk size, zone, and
number of CPUs that a virtual machine will have. These forms look like the forms
used in Cloud Marketplace .
The following screenshot illustrates what a deployment form looks like:
Alternatives to Form Schema
Form Schema is an alternative to an existing way of creating UI forms, called
Display Metadata.
Compared to Display Metadata, Form Schema has improved flexibility and is open
source.
Relationship to JSON Schema
Form Schema builds on
JSON schema form ,
which is an open source schema written in JSON for specifying and validating a
set of parameters.
Form Schema references fields in the JSON Schema and inherits attributes from
it.
You can include Form Schema inside the JSON Schema by including an array of
form entry objects inside the form attribute, as illustrated by the
following example:
{
"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
"type": "object",
"properties": {...}
"form": [
...Form List goes here...
]
}
How to specify a Form Schema instance
You can specify Form Schema instances in YAML format.
You create a schema file that lays out the UI widgets in the order they should
appear in the UI. This schema file has the file extension .py or .jinja, as
described in the Deployment Manager
documentation .
You then add the files to a Deployment Manager template zip archive and
upload the zip archive.
How Form Schema fits into the Service Catalog workflow
Cloud admins make use of Form Schema with Service Catalog as follows:
Create a Deployment Manager template.
Specify a JSON Schema to define or validate which input fields can be
used in the UI for the Deployment Manager template
configuration.
Define in Form Schema which fields to include for a particular solution and
the order in which those fields should appear. In addition to ordering, you
can use Form Schema to provide user-friendly text for enumerated fields,
such as dropdowns, and group fields together with section titles.
Form list
An array of form entry objects. Each object represents a UI
component in a form. You should specify fields in the order in which you want
them to appear in the form, regardless of their location in the schema.
Form entry
A form entry specifies the appearance of a UI component in a form. It can be a
string, where it specifies the key for a field in the JSON Schema, or an object.
When a form entry is a string, default values for the appearance are inherited
from the JSON Schema entry.
When a form entry is an object, the key attribute refers to the JSON Schema
entry. Use a dot . to separate nodes for a nested value. For example, use
name.first to reference a first field inside a name object. All other
fields are optional, and where specified inherit a default value from the JSON
Schema.
Fields
key* String Specifies the field definition in the JSON schema.
widget Widget Specifies the UI widget to use for this field. Default:
based on mapping the field type .
title String Title for the field. Inherits title from schema.
notitle Boolean Whether to hide the title. Default: false.
description String Used as a hint or tooltip for the field. Inherits description from schema.
validationMessage String Message to show when the field is invalid.
placeholder String Placeholder for the field. Note: Material Design uses title as a placeholder instead.
readonly Boolean Whether field is read only. Inherits readonly from schema.
condition String A logical expression that determines whether the field is shown.
titleMap Title map Provides text labels for the options in checkboxes , radio , and select widgets.
* required
Special handling for types
Object
For type object , the field additionalProperties defines whether or not extra
properties can be present. The field can have a value of true (allow anything),
false (no extra properties allowed), or some JSON schema that constrains the
additional properties allowed. When the value is false or not present, widgets
are displayed for the fields listed in the items attribute. For other values
(true or JSON schema), a textarea is displayed for entering a JSON value.
Type-to-widget mapping
If no widget is specified in the Form Schema, a default value is used based on
the JSON Schema Type of the field, as follows:
Schema Type
Schema Form Widget
string
text
number
number
integer
number
boolean
checkbox
object
fieldset
string + enum
radio (3 or less choices)
string + enum
select (4 or more choices)
array + enum
checkboxes
array
array
Widget
A widget is specified as a string that refers to one of the following data
structures.
Array
A list where rows can be added, removed, and reordered. JSON Schema allows the
items property for the array type to be either a schema or a list of
schemas. The list is not supported by Form Schema.
Arrays with primitive items
Because the form schema requires all form entries to have a key, and arrays that
contain primitive (non-object) items don't have a key to reference them by, the
form should reference the primitive array entry using a reserved keyword:
'x-googleProperty'.
For example, you would define a JSON schema array containing strings as follows:
{
'exampleArray': {
'type': 'array',
'items': {
'type': 'string'
}
}
}
Should then be referenced in the form schema as:
[
{
'key': 'exampleArray',
'widget': 'array',
'items': [
{
'key': 'exampleArray.x-arrayPrimitive'
}
]
},
]
Arrays with object items
Arrays that contain objects should specify each key in the item type that should
be rendered in the form.
For example, consider a JSON schema array containing an object:
{
'exampleArray': {
'type': 'array',
'items': {
'type': 'object',
'properties': {
'someArrayItemAttribute': {
'type': 'string'
}
}
}
}
}
The form schema required to create a form array with an input for the
someArrayItemAttribute attribute would be:
[
{
'key': 'exampleArray',
'widget': 'array',
'items': [
{
'key': 'exampleArray.someArrayItemAttribute'
}
]
},
]
Checkbox
An input field with type checkbox .
Checkboxes
A list of input fields of type checkbox . The JSON Schema field should be of
type array and have an enum attribute. To provide labels for the options,
you can specify a titleMap .
Expander
Very similar to a section, but places fields inside an expansion panel widget
that users can open and close by clicking on the title.
Number
An input field with type number . The following attributes from the JSON Schema
are validators for the field: minimum , maximum , exclusiveMinimum ,
exclusiveMaximum , multipleOf .
Password
An input field with type password .
Radio
An input field with type radio . Use this for fields that have an enum list
in the JSON Schema, or are of type boolean. To provide labels for the options,
you can specify a titleMap .
Section
This widget groups together a set of fields. The key field is ignored. A
section has a required items attribute, which is an array of
form entry objects. A section can have the following optional
attributes: title , description , condition .
Select
A select input field. Use this for fields that have an enum list in the JSON
Schema, or are of type boolean. To provide labels for the options, you can
specify a titleMap .
Text
An input widget with type text . If the JSON Schema contains a pattern
attribute, the pattern is used as a regex validator.
Textarea
A textarea input widget. This widget is displayed in some situations for
entering JSON directly. See object .
Title map
The titleMap attribute can be specified for widgets of type checkboxes ,
radio , and select . It's ignored for other widgets.
The attribute is an array of objects that contain two attributes, value and
name . The value attribute is a reference to one enum value for the field.
The name attribute is text to use as a label for the corresponding option in
the UI widget. When the widget is radio or checkboxes , an optional
description field is added as subtext for that radio button or checkbox.
If no titleMap is provided, the enum values are used instead.
