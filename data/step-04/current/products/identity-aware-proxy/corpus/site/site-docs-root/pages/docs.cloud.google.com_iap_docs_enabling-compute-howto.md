Enable IAP for Compute Engine
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to secure a Compute Engine instance with
Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) .
Before you begin
To enable IAP for Compute Engine, you need the
following:
A Google Cloud console project with billing enabled.
A group of one or more Compute Engine instances, served by a load
balancer.
Learn about Setting up an external HTTPS load balancer .
Learn about setting up an internal HTTP load balancer .
A domain name registered to the address of your load balancer.
Application code to verify that all requests have an identity.
Learn about Getting the user's identity .
If you don't have your Compute Engine instance set up already, see
Setting up IAP for Compute Engine
for a complete walkthrough.
IAP uses a Google-managed OAuth client to authenticate users.
Only users within the organization can access the IAP-enabled
application. If you want to allow access to users outside of your organization,
see Enable IAP for external applications .
Note: The ability to authenticate users with a Google-managed OAuth client is available in Preview .
You can enable IAP on a Compute Engine
backend service or on a
Compute Engine forwarding rule .
When you enable IAP on a Compute Engine backend service,
only that backend service is protected by IAP. When you enable
IAP on a Compute Engine forwarding rule, all of the
Compute Engine instances behind the forwarding rule are protected by
IAP.
Enable IAP on a forwarding rule
You can enable IAP on a forwarding rule by using the
load balancer authorization policies
framework.
gcloud
Run the following command to prepare a policy.yaml file.
The policy allows clients with an IP address range of 10.0.0.0/24 to
enable IAP on a forwarding rule.
$ cat << EOF > policy.yaml
action : CUSTOM
description : authz policy with Cloud IAP
name : AUTHZ_POLICY_NAME
httpRules :
- from :
sources :
- ipBlocks :
- prefix : "10.0.0.0"
length : 24
customProvider :
cloudIap : {}
target :
loadBalancingScheme : EXTERNAL_MANAGED
resources :
- https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ LOCATION /forwardingRules/ FORWARDING_RULE_ID
EOF
Run the following command to enable IAP on a forwarding rule.
gcloud network-security authz-policies import AUTHZ_POLICY_NAME \
--source=policy.yaml \
--location= LOCATION \
--project= PROJECT_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : The region that the resource is located in.
FORWARDING_RULE_ID : The ID of the forwarding rule resource.
AUTHZ_POLICY_NAME : The name of the authorization policy.
API
Run the following command to prepare a policy.json file.
cat << EOF > policy.json
{
"name": " AUTHZ_POLICY_NAME ",
"target": {
"loadBalancingScheme": "INTERNAL_MANAGED",
"resources": [
"https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ LOCATION /forwardingRules/ FORWARDING_RULE_ID "
],
},
"action": "CUSTOM",
"httpRules": [
{
"from": {
"sources": {
"ipBlocks": [
{
"prefix": "10.0.0.0",
"length": 24
}
]
}
}
}
],
"customProvider": {
"cloudIap": {}
}
}
EOF
Run the following command to enable IAP on a forwarding rule.
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d @policy.json \
"https://networksecurity.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /authzPolicies"
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : The region that the resource is located in.
FORWARDING_RULE_ID : The ID of the forwarding rule resource.
AUTHZ_POLICY_NAME : The name of the authorization policy.
After you enable IAP on a forwarding rule, you can
apply permissions to resources .
Enable IAP on a Compute Engine backend service
You can enable IAP on a Compute Engine backend service
through that backend service.
console
The Google-managed OAuth client is not available when enabling IAP using the Google Cloud console.
If you haven't configured your project's OAuth consent screen, you'll be
prompted to do so. To configure your OAuth consent screen, see
Setting up your OAuth consent screen .
If you are running GKE clusters version 1.24 or later, you can configure
IAP and GKE by using the Kubernetes Gateway API. To do so, complete
the following steps and then follow the instructions in
Configure IAP .
Do not configure BackendConfig .
Setting up IAP access
Go to the
Identity-Aware Proxy page .
Go to the Identity-Aware Proxy page
Select the project you want to secure with IAP.
Select the checkbox next to the resource you want to grant access to.
If you don't see a resource, ensure that the resource is created and that
the BackendConfig Compute Engine ingress controller is synced.
To verify that the backend service is available, run the following
gcloud command:
gcloud compute backend-services list
On the right side panel, click Add principal .
In the Add principals dialog that appears, enter the email addresses of groups or
individuals who should have the IAP-secured Web App User role for the project.
The following kinds of principals can have this role:
Google Account : user@gmail.com
Google Group : admins@googlegroups.com
Service account : server@example.gserviceaccount.com
Google Workspace domain : example.com
Make sure to add a Google Account that you have access to.
Select Cloud IAP > IAP-secured Web App User from the Roles
drop-down list.
Click Save .
Turning on IAP
On the Identity-Aware Proxy page, under APPLICATIONS ,
find the load balancer that serves the instance group you want to restrict
access to. To turn on IAP for a resource,
toggle the on/off switch in the IAP
column.
To enable IAP:
At least one protocol in the load balancer frontend
configuration must be HTTPS. Learn about setting up
a load balancer .
You need the compute.backendServices.update ,
clientauthconfig.clients.create , clientauthconfig.clients.update ,
and clientauthconfig.clients.getWithSecret permissions. These permissions
are granted by roles, such as the Project Editor role. To learn more, see
Managing access to IAP-secured resources .
In the Turn on IAP window that appears, click Turn On to
confirm that you want IAP to secure your resource. After you turn on
IAP, it requires login credentials for all connections to your load balancer.
Only accounts with the IAP-Secured Web App User role on the project will be
given access.
gcloud
Before you set up your project and IAP, you need an up-to-date version of the
gcloud CLI. For instructions on how to install the gcloud CLI,
see Install the gcloud CLI .
To authenticate, use the Google Cloud CLI and run the following command.
gcloud auth login
To sign in, follow the URL that appears.
After you sign in, copy the verification code that appears and paste it in the command line.
Run the following command to specify the project that contains the resource that you want to protect with IAP.
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
To enable IAP, run either the globally or regionally scoped command.
Global scope
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME --global --iap=enabled
Regional scope
gcloud compute backend-services update BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME --region REGION_NAME --iap=enabled
After you enable IAP, you can use the gcloud CLI to modify
the IAP access policy using the IAM role
roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor . Learn more about
managing roles and permissions .
API
Run the following command to prepare a settings.json file.
cat << EOF > settings.json
{
"iap":
{
"enabled":true
}
}
EOF
Run the following command to enable IAP.
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d @settings.json \
"https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID / REGION /backendServices/ BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME "
After you enable IAP, you can use the Google Cloud CLI to modify the
IAP access policy using the IAM role
roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor . Learn more about
managing roles and permissions .
