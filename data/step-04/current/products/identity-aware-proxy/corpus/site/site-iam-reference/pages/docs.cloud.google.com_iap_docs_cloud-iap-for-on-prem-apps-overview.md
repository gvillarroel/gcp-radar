Overview of IAP for on-premises apps
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) allows
you to manage access to HTTP-based apps outside of
Google Cloud. This includes apps on-premises in your enterprise's data centers.
To learn how to secure
on-premises apps with IAP, see
Setting up IAP for on-premises apps .
Introduction
IAP targets on-premises apps with the IAP
On-Prem Connector . The On-Prem Connector uses a Cloud Deployment Manager
template to create the resources needed to host and deploy the
IAP On-Prem Connector into an IAP-enabled
Google Cloud project,
forwarding authenticated and authorized requests to on-premises
apps.
The On-Prem Connector
creates the following resources:
A Cloud Service Mesh deployment that acts as a proxy for the on-premises app.
An external Application Load Balancer
that acts as the ingress controller for requests.
Routing rules.
A deployment can have multiple Cloud Service Mesh
backend services that run behind one external Application Load Balancer. Each backend service
maps to an individual on-premises app.
When the IAP on-prem connector is deployed and IAP is enabled for the newly created on-prem connector backend service, IAP
secures your app with identity
and context based
Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policies. Because an IAM
access policy is configured on the backend service
resource level, you're able to have different access control lists for each of
your on-premises apps. This means only one Google Cloud
project is needed to manage access to multiple on-premises apps.
How IAP for on-premises apps works
When a request is sent to an app hosted on Google Cloud,
IAP authenticates and authorizes the user requests.
It then grants the user access to the Google Cloud app.
When a request is sent to an on-premises app, IAP
authenticates and authorizes the user request. It then routes the request to
the IAP on-prem connector. The IAP on-prem connector
forwards the request through a Hybrid Connectivity Network Endpoint Group
from Google Cloud to the on-premises network.
The following diagram shows the high-level traffic flow of a web request for a
Google Cloud app ( app1 ) and an on-premises app ( app2 ).
Routing rules
When configuring a IAP connector deployment,
you configure the routing rules. These rules route authenticated and authorized
web requests coming to your DNS hostname ingress point to the DNS hostname
that's the destination.
The following is an example of routing parameters defined for a
IAP connector Deployment Manager
template.
routing :
- name : hr
mapping :
- name : host
source : www.hr-domain.com
destination : hr-internal.domain.com
- name : sub
source : sheets.hr-domain.com
destination : sheets.hr-internal.domain.com
- name : finance
mapping :
- name : host
source : www.finance-domain.com
destination : finance-internal.domain.com
Each routing name corresponds to a new, Ambassador-created
Compute Engine backend service resource.
The mapping parameter specifies a list of Ambassador routing rules for a
backend service.
The source of a routing rule is mapped to a destination , where source
is the URL of requests coming to
Google Cloud, and destination is the URL for your on-premises app
that IAP routes traffic to after a user has been
authorized and authenticated.
The following table demonstrates example rules to route incoming requests from
www.hr-domain.com to hr-internal.domain.com :
Compute Engine backend service
Routing rule name
Source
Destination
hr
hr-host
www.hr-domain.com
hr-internal.domain.com
hr-sub
sheets.hr-domain.com
sheets.hr-internal.domain.com
finance
finance-host
www.finance-domain.com
finance-internal.domain.com
