Hosting a sign-in page with Cloud Run
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
To use external identities with Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP), your
app needs a sign-in page. IAP will redirect users to this
page to authenticate before they can access secure resources.
This document shows you how to deploy and customize a prebuilt sign-in page
using Cloud Run. This is the fastest way to get started with external
identities, and doesn't require you to write any code.
You can also build a sign-in page yourself. Building your own page is more
difficult, but increases your control over the authentication flow and user
experience. See
Creating a sign-in page with FirebaseUI and
Creating a custom sign-in page
to learn more.
Sign-in page limitations
You cannot use the prebuilt sign-in page if
your project has email enumeration protection enabled.
If your project has email enumeration protection enabled, disable email-enumeration-protection before continuing with the procedures in this document.
Note: Starting June 24 2024, the sign-in page and admin/ page might not work
properly on browsers that disable third-party cookies tracking or implement
storage partitioning. Follow Third-party Cookies and Storage Partitioning in Browsers for fixes.
Before you begin
Enable the Compute Engine API.
Enable Compute Engine API
Enable external identities , and select
the Create a sign-in page for me option during setup. This lets
Cloud Run and FirebaseUI create a sign-in page for you.
Ensure that the service account used by Cloud Run, PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com, has the following predefined roles :
roles/identitytoolkit.viewer
roles/iap.settingsAdmin
roles/compute.networkViewer
Setting the Authorized Redirect URI for Identity Platform providers
If you use Identity Platform providers that require sign-in redirect (redirect to the external IdP sign-in page). You must add the hosted sign-in page's URL as an authorized redirect URL in your provider configuration.
For example, for a Google provider, you need to do the following:
Copy the Login URL after selecting your IAP-secured application.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Credentials page.
Go to Credentials
Add LOGIN_URL /__/auth/handler as one of the authorized redirect URIs for your app's OAuth 2.0 client. Select the same OAuth client ID that you used when configuring the Google provider.
For other SAML and OIDC providers, do the same by adding LOGIN_URL /__/auth/handler as the authorized redirect URI or ACS URL.
Testing the sign-in page
The initial sign-in page created by IAP is fully functional.
To test it:
Navigate to a resource protected by IAP. You should be
automatically redirected to the sign-in page.
Select a tenant and provider to sign-in with. If you don't see any tenants
or providers listed, make sure you've configured one using
Identity Platform .
Sign in with your credentials.
You should be redirected to the protected resource.
Customizing the sign-in page
You can customize the sign-in page using a JSON configuration file. Some options
include:
Adding a header and logo to the sign-in page.
Specifying the available tenants and providers.
Customizing the icons and styling of each tenant and provider button.
Adding links to your app's privacy policy and terms of service.
The following sections explain how to access and update the JSON configuration
file.
Obtaining an access token
In order to administer the sign-in page, you need a Google access token. The
easiest way to obtain one is by enabling Google as a provider for
Identity Platform. If your app already uses Google as an identity provider,
you can skip this section.
Warning: These steps will allow users to sign in to your app using a Google
account. If you don't want to allow this, disable Google as an identity
provider after you've finished customizing the hosted UI.
Go to the Identity Platform Providers page in the
Google Cloud console.
Go to the Identity Platform Providers page
Click Add a Provider .
Select Google from the list of providers.
Configure the Web Client ID and Web Client Secret :
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Credentials page.
Go to Credentials
Use an existing OAuth 2.0 client or create a new one. Configure the Client ID and Client secret to Web Client ID and Web Client Secret . Add LOGIN_URL /__/auth/handler as one of the authorized redirect URIs for the OAuth 2.0 client. The LOGIN_URL is the Login URL
created by IAP after selecting the Create a sign-in page for me option. It can be found on the IAP page in the Google Cloud console, by selecting the IAP-secured resource.
Click Save on both pages.
Signing in to the admin panel
The JSON configuration for the sign-in page hosted by Cloud Run at LOGIN_URL /admin panel.
The following steps show how to access the panel. Note that you'll need the
Storage Admin ( roles/storage.admin ) role.
Important: If you don't sign in to the admin panel, then you might encounter
the following error: 404 Response: The specified bucket does not exist .
Go to the IAP page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the IAP page
Select your resource from the list.
Launch the URL listed under Customize page in the info panel. It should
look something like https://servicename-xyz-uc.a.run.app/admin .
Note: If you see a warning indicating the app isn't verified yet, you can
safely bypass it for development purposes. See
Exceptions to verification requirements
to learn more.
Sign in with the same Google account you used to configure
IAP. A text editor containing the JSON configuration
file appears.
Modifying the configuration
The configuration schema for the sign-in page is based on
FirebaseUI ,
and inherits many of its properties. Instead of using the IAP created LOGIN_URL as the default authDomain, you can use PROJECT_ID .firebaseapp.com .
If you want to use PROJECT_ID .firebaseapp.com as your authDomain ,
change signInFlow as popup to avoid third-parity storage access issue on major browsers(See Best practices for using signInWithRedirect on browsers that block third-party storage access ). Additionally, following instructions in Setting Authorized Redirect URI for Identity Platform Providers to add the PROJECT_ID .firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler as one of the authorized redirect URIs or ACS URLs for the Identity Platform provider that users will sign in with.
The following code shows an example
configuration with three tenants:

For a complete list of available properties, see the
reference documentation .
Overriding CSS
You can use the styleUrl property to specify a custom CSS file. Styles in
this file will override the default CSS. The file must be publicly accessible
using HTTPS (for example, hosted in a Cloud Storage bucket).
The following example demonstrates overriding the default CSS:
/** Change header title style. */
.heading-center {
color: #7181a5;
font-family: Arial , Helvetica , sans-serif ;
font-size: 20 px ;
font-weight: bold ;
}
/** Use round edged borders for container. */
.main-container {
border-radius: 5 px ;
}
/** Change page background color. */
body {
background-color: #f8f9fa;
}
Redeploying the Cloud Run instance
In some cases, you might want to redeploy the Cloud Run instance
that hosts the sign-in page. Example scenarios include:
Adding, modifying, or removing identity providers
Modifying tenant configurations
Setting environment variables
Updating the container image to the latest version
Regularly updating and redeploying the container image ensures you have the
latest bug fixes and security patches. You can view the list of changes
between versions on
GitHub .
You can get the current version of the deployed container using the /versionz
endpoint. For example:
curl 'https://servicename-xyz-uc.a.run.app/versionz'
To redeploy the Cloud Run instance:
Go to the Cloud Run page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Cloud Run page
Select the instance hosting the sign-in page.
Click Edit & Deploy New Revision .
Optionally, specify advanced settings for the revision, or add an
environment variable by clicking the Variables & Secrets tab.
Click Deploy .
Advanced options
Customizing the sign-in page programmatically
In addition to using the /admin console, you can update the JSON
configuration programmatically.
To get the current configuration, use the /get_admin_config endpoint.
For example:
curl - H 'Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]'
'https://servicename-xyz-uc.a.run.app/get_admin_config'
To update the configuration, use /set_admin_config . For example:
curl - XPOST - H 'Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]' - H "Content-type: application/json"
- d '[UPDATED-CONFIG]' 'https://servicename-xyz-uc.a.run.app/set_admin_config'
Both REST calls require the
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write scope, and a valid OAuth
token must be attached to the Authorization header.
Setting environment variables
You can set environment variables on the Cloud Run instance
to customize advance settings. The following table lists the available
variables:
Variable
Description
DEBUG_CONSOLE
A boolean value ( 0 or 1 ) indicating whether to
log all network request errors and details. Sensitive data will not be
logged. Disabled ( 0 ) by default.
UI_CONFIG
A string containing the JSON configuration for the sign-in page. Using
this variable instead of the /admin panel avoids reading and
writing to a Cloud Storage when accessing the configuration. Invalid
configurations are ignored. Using the /admin panel to
validate your JSON before setting this variable can help minimize syntax
errors.
GCS_BUCKET_NAME
A string overriding the default Cloud Storage bucket used to store
the JSON configuration. The file is named config.json , and
the default location is
gcip-iap-bucket-[CLOUD-RUN-SERVICE-NAME]-[PROJECT-NUMBER] .
ALLOW_ADMIN
A boolean value ( 0 or 1 ) indicating whether to
allow access to the /admin configuration panel.
Enabled ( 1 ) by default.
You'll need to deploy a new revision of the Cloud Run instance
after updating variables before the changes take effect. To learn more about
environment variables, see the
Cloud Run documentation .
Customizing the domain
By default, users will see the URL of the Cloud Run instance
when signing in. To specify a custom domain instead:
Follow the steps in Mapping custom domains
to set a custom domain for the Cloud Run instance.
Configure IAP to use the new authentication URL:
Go to the IAP page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the IAP page
Select the resource protected by IAP.
In the side panel, select the Edit icon next to the Login URL
field.
Select Use an existing hosted sign-in page , and choose your domain
from the drop-down menu.
Click Save .
Using one sign-in page for multiple IAP resources
You can protect multiple IAP resources using the same sign-in
page. This reduces the work associated with managing multiple configurations.
To re-use a sign-in page:
Follow the steps in this article to deploy the authentication page for
the first resource protected by IAP.
Enable IAP for the second resource. When prompted to
specify a sign-in page, select I'll provide my own , and enter the
URL of the Cloud Run service as the URL .
Redeploy the Cloud Run service.
Troubleshooting
Service unavailable with hosted sign-in page
When using hosted sign-in page, you receive the following error:
Service unavailable
You are then unable to access the sign-in page.
To resolve this error, do the following:
Verify that the default Cloud Storage bucket is in the format
gcip-iap-bucket- CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE_NAME - PROJECT-NUMBER .
Verify that the default Cloud Storage bucket exists and contains a
file named config.json .
Note: If the bucket or config.json file is missing, it means
that the initial configuration wasn't saved. To create them, visit the
/admin page and save the configuration file.
Third-party cookies and storage partitioning in browsers
For browsers that disable third-party cookies or implement storage partitioning,
the login page or the admin/ page might not work properly. To resolve this
issue, do the following:
Redeploy the sign-in page to use the
latest version 1.0.1.
If you customize the sign-in page ,
make sure that authDomain is set as the LOGIN_URL that
IAP created. Alternatively, if the signInFlow is set
to popup , you can set the authDomain to
PROJECT_ID .firebaseapp.com .
The following snippet shows the configuration of authDomain for a
custom sign-in page:
{
"AIzaSyC5DtmRUR...": {
"authDomain": " LOGIN_URL ",
...
}
}
The following snippet describes the authDomain for a popup sign-in page:
{
"AIzaSyC5DtmRUR...": {
"authDomain": " PROJECT_ID .firebaseapp.com",
"tenants": {
"tenant-a-id": {
...
"signInFlow": "popup"
...
}
}
...
}
}
