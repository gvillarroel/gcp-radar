Before you begin
Before you start this tutorial, you need the following:
Select or create a Google Cloud project.
GO TO THE PROJECTS PAGE
Enable billing for your project. Read about how to
Modify a project's billing settings
Step 1: Create a Compute Engine template
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Compute Engine > Create an instance template
page and select the project where you want to create a template.
GO TO THE CREATE AN INSTANCE TEMPLATE PAGE
Use the default values except for the following:
Machine type:
micro (f1-micro)
Access scopes:
Set access for each API
Compute Engine: Read Only
Firewall:
Allow HTTP traffic
In the Management section, under Automation > Startup script , copy

apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install git
apt-get -y install virtualenv
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
cd python-docs-samples/iap
virtualenv venv -p python3
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cat example_gce_backend.py |
sed -e "s/YOUR_BACKEND_SERVICE_ID/ $( gcloud compute backend-services describe my-backend-service --global --format = "value(id)" ) /g" |
sed -e "s/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/ $( gcloud config get-value account | tr -cd "[0-9]" ) /g" > real_backend.py
gunicorn real_backend:app -b 0 .0.0.0:80
When you're finished updating values, click Create to create the template.
Step 2: Create a Managed Instance Group
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Compute Engine > Create a new instance group
page and select the project where you want to create a Managed Instance
Group.
GO TO THE CREATE AN INSTANCE GROUP PAGE
Use the default values except for the following:
Name: my-managed-instance-group
Location: Multi-zone
Instance template: Select the instance template you created in Step 1
Number of instances: To change the number of instances, you must first turn off autoscaling.
Autoscaling mode: Don't autoscale
Health check: select Create a health check , then enter the following
values:
Name: my-health-check
Protocol: HTTP
Use your new health check by clicking Save and continue .
When you're finished updating values, click Create to create the Managed
Instance Group (MIG).
Step 3: Get a domain name and certificate
To use the Load Balancer with HTTPS traffic, you need a domain name and a
signed certificate. You can
register a domain on Cloud Domains ,
or use the domain registrar of your choice. Register your domain before you
continue.
Set up your certificate
Create a certificate that identifies your website to your users. For information about how to create a certificate, see Using Google-managed SSL certificates .
Your CA has to verify that you own the domain name you registered. In the
following steps, you create a VM to authenticate your domain with the CA.
Create a VM to authenticate your domain ownership
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Compute Engine > Create an instance page .
GO TO THE CREATE AN INSTANCE PAGE
Use the default values except for the following:
Name: certbot-vm
Machine type: micro (f1-micro)
Access scopes:
Set access for each API
Compute Engine: Read/Write
Boot disk image:
Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)
Firewall:
Allow HTTP traffic
Allow HTTPS traffic
When you finish updating values, click Create to create the VM
instance. Note the external IP address of the VM that you just created. You'll need
it in the next step.
Set up your domain to point to the VM
To set up your domain to point to the VM, follow these steps to configure A
records:
Sign in to your domain's account at your domain host.
Find the page to update your domain's DNS records. This page might be
called something like DNS Management, Name Server Management, or
Advanced Settings.
Change your A records to the following values:
Name/Host/Alias: @
Value: the external IP address of the VM that you created to authenticate
your domain ownership above.
TTL: the default for your registrar, or 86400 (one day).
Wait for the DNS record to update. It can take up to one day for the record
you added to propagate.
To learn more, see
About A records .
Test your server
To test that your server is working correctly, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Compute Engine > VM Instances page.
GO TO THE VM INSTANCES PAGE
Under Connect for certbot-vm , click SSH .
Run the following commands to run a small web server on your VM:
mkdir web
cd web
echo "Hello" > index.html
sudo busybox httpd -v -f
In a web browser, go to the domain name you registered earlier. Your web
browser should display Hello , and your SSH session should display a
message that contains ... response:200 . If not, wait a few minutes, then
repeat this step.
After the test is successful, press Ctrl+C to stop the web
server.
Create a certificate
To create a certificate, register with Let's Encrypt
by running the following commands on the VM where YOUR_DOMAIN is your
domain name, not including the protocol:
sudo pkill busybox
sudo apt-get install -y certbot
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d YOUR-DOMAIN
During this process, Let's Encrypt might request an email address to send a
reminder when your certificate expires (by default, 3 months after
it's issued). You must also agree to Let's Encrypt's Terms of Service.
When you're successfully registered, a message that reads
Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at... appears.
Add the certificate to your project
To add the certificate to your project, run the following commands on the VM:
sudo su
cd /etc/letsencrypt/live/ YOUR_DOMAIN
gcloud compute ssl-certificates create my-cert --certificate=fullchain.pem --private-key=privkey.pem
After you've successfully created your certificate, a message appears
that's similar to: Created
[https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/example-project/global/sslCertificates/my-cert]
Before you continue, close the SSH session.
Step 4: Create a load balancer
Before you start this step, make sure you closed the SSH session you started in
the previous step. When you're ready, follow the steps below to create a load
balancer:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Network Services > Create a load balancer
page and select the project where you want to create a load balancer.
GO TO THE CREATE A LOAD BALANCER PAGE
Under HTTP(S) Load Balancing , click Start configuration .
Select From Internet to my VMs .
On the New external Application Load Balancer page that appears, enter a Name
for your load balancer.
Click Backend configuration .
Under Backend services & backend buckets , select
Create a backend service .
Add a name for your backend service, such as my-backend-service .
Caution: You must use the exact
my-backend-service name. If
you use a different name, the startup script on your VMs cannot
find the correct Backend Service ID to authenticate requests.
Go to the Security section, and then select
Enable IAP to secure access to your applications .
Cloud CDN and IAP are not compatible. If you
have Cloud CDN enabled and you select to enable
IAP, Cloud CDN is automatically disabled.
Click Create . The Load balancing page loads, with your new load
balancer displayed in the list of load balancers.
After the Google Cloud console finishes creating the new load balancer,
click the name of the load balancer and note the external IP address under
Details > Frontend . You use it in the next step.
Set up your domain to point to the load balancer
To set up your domain to point to the load balancer, configure A records using
the following steps:
Sign in to your domain's account at your domain host.
Find the page to update your domain's DNS records. This page might be
called something like DNS Management, Name Server Management, or
Advanced Settings.
Change your A records to the following values:
Name/Host/Alias: @
Value: the external IP address of the load balancer you created
earlier. Don't include the port :443 in your DNS record.
TTL: the default for your registrar, or 86400 (one day).
Wait for the DNS record to update. It can take up to a day for the record
you just added to propagate.
To test the load balancer, use a web browser to go to your domain with an
https:// protocol.
If the load balancer isn't set up yet, you see "HTTP 502" errors.
When the load balancer is ready, you see "Unauthorized request."
To learn more, see
About A records .
Restart your VMs
To correctly authenticate requests from IAP, you must restart
the VMs in your MIG.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Compute Engine > Instance groups page .
GO TO THE INSTANCE GROUPS PAGE
Click my-managed-instance-group .
On the top of the instance group details that appear, click Rolling
Restart/Replace .
On the Restart/replace instances of my-managed-instance-group page,
set the following values:
Operation: Restart
Maximum unavailable: 3 instances out of 3 instances
Minimum wait time: 0 s
When you're finished updating values, click Restart .
Step 5: Set up IAP
Configure your firewall
Next, configure your firewall to block access to the underlying VMs and
only allow access through IAP:
Go to the Google Cloud console
VPC network > Firewall rules .
GO TO THE FIREWALL RULES PAGE
Select the checkbox next to the following rules:
default-allow-http
default-allow-https
default-allow-internal
Click Delete .
Click Create firewall rule and set the following values:
Name: allow-iap-traffic
Targets: All instances in the network
Source IP ranges (press Enter after you paste each value
in the box). The IP ranges are allowlisted because it is a prerequisite
for load balancer communication to backends.
130.211.0.0/22
35.191.0.0/16
Protocols and ports:
Specified protocols and ports
tcp:80
When you're finished updating values, click Create .
Set up IAP
To set up IAP for your project, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Security > Identity-Aware Proxy
page and select the project that you want to enable IAP for.
GO TO THE IDENTITY-AWARE PROXY PAGE
If you haven't configured your project's OAuth consent screen, you're
prompted to do so:
Caution: Don't enter any confidential information on the OAuth consent screen. Any
information you save to the OAuth consent screen may be publicly visible for anyone who accesses
your URL. Email and product details are displayed on the login screen and when someone tries to
access a resource for which they don't have permission.
Go to the OAuth consent screen .
Configure consent screen
Under Support email , select the email address you want to display as a public
contact. The email address must belong to the currently logged in user account or to a Google
Group for which the currently logged in user is a manager or owner .
Enter the Application name you want to display.
Add any optional details you'd like.
Click Save .
To change information on the OAuth consent screen later, such as the product name or email address,
repeat the preceding steps to configure the consent screen.
Next to my-backend-service ,
toggle the on/off switch in the
IAP column.
In the Turn on IAP window that appears, select the checkbox next to
"I have read the configuration requirements and configured my
Compute Engine
resource according to documentation."
Click Turn on .
Add principals to the access list
Next, add principals to the IAP access list for your project.
On the IAM & admin > Identity-Aware Proxy
right side Access section, click Add .
Enter the principals you want to give access to, including yourself, and
assign the principals the IAP-secured Web App User role. Principals can be:
Google Accounts: user@gmail.com
Google Groups: admins@googlegroups.com
Service accounts: server@example.gserviceaccount.com
Google Workspace domains: example.com
Step 6: Test IAP
To test that IAP is working correctly, follow these steps:
In your web browser, navigate to your domain.
If you see "Unauthorized request", try again in a few minutes.
When you see a Google sign-in screen, sign in using the Google Account you
gave access to in the previous step.
A message appears like "Hi, user@example.com. I am
my-managed-instance-group-29z6."
Try refreshing the page. Your browser should show the names of the 3
machines in your managed instance group. This is the load balancer
distributing traffic across the VMs in the group.
Congratulations! You've successfully enabled a load-balanced service using
IAP.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this
tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and
delete the individual resources.
After you finish setting up IAP for Compute Engine,
you can clean up the resources that you created on Google Cloud so you
aren't billed for them in the future. The following sections describe how to
delete or turn off these resources.
Deleting the project
The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you
created for the tutorial.
To delete the project:
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
Deleting instances
To delete a Compute Engine instance:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
VM instances page.
Go to VM instances
Select the checkbox for
the instance that you want to delete.
To delete the instance, click more_vert More actions , click Delete ,
and then follow the instructions.
Deleting firewall rules for the default network
To delete a firewall rule:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Firewall page.
Go to Firewall
Select the checkbox for the firewall rule that you want to delete.
To delete the firewall rule,
click delete Delete .
