IAP reauthentication
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
IAP reauthentication lets service and application owners or
Google Cloud administrators require authenticated end users to
reauthenticate after a specified time when accessing an
IAP-protected service or application and limit how long a
user can access a IAP-protected service or application before
authentication is required.
IAP reauthentication (or, reauth) is designed to enforce reauthentication policies for IAP-protected services and applications (or, apps). Using this service, you can enforce reauthentication policies for critical services and applications that handle confidential information. For example, you can specify that users accessing a critical HR application reauthenticate hourly using a second factor.
Supported reauthentication methods
You can use the following methods to manage the reauthentication settings:
Login : End users reauthenticate using their login credentials.
Secure key : End users reauthenticate using their configured security key.
Enrolled second factors : End users reauthenticate using one of their
enrolled second factors.
For more information, see IapSettings .
Set up a reauthentication policy
The reauthSettings are included as part of IapSettings and can be set on any
resource type in the
resource hierarchy . You can set reauthSettings at the organization, folder, project, or service level to apply restrictions. For example, you can limit the session length to a maximum of one hour for all applications in an organization or to a specific application.
There are two policy types that you can use to set reauthentication:
Minimum : If the policy type is set to MINIMUM on a resource, such as an
organization, then, when evaluating the reauthentication settings on the
lower-level resource, such as a folder, the two settings are merged. If the
lower-level resource has no reauthentication settings, the merge result is the
non-empty settings of the higher-level resource. Otherwise, the merge takes the
shorter session duration and the higher precedence reauthentication method
between the two resources. The resulting merged policy type is set to
MINIMUM .
Default : If the policy type is set as DEFAULT on a resource, such as
organization, then when evaluating the reauthentication setting on the
lower-level resource, such as a folder, the lower-level resource setting is used
if configured; otherwise, the higher-level resource reauthentication setting is
applied.
For both policy types, the evaluation process is repeated to determine the
reauthSettings for the target service or application. The effective
reauthSettings at any level are determined as follows:
Inheritance : The settings from the higher-level resource are merged with
the settings of the lower-level resource.
Merge rules : If the lower-level resource has no specific
reauthentication settings, it inherits the settings from the higher level.
If both levels have reauthSettings , the merged result uses the following:
The shorter session duration.
The reauthentication method with the higher precedence.
The precedence is Secure key (highest), Enrolled second factors
(medium), and Login (lowest).
Resulting policy type : The policy type of the merged settings is
MINIMUM .
The following examples show the settings before and after evaluation. During
evaluation, the folder and organization reauthSettings are merged, resulting
in changing the policy type of the folder to MINIMUM . The merged settings are
then used to merge with the service or application reauthSettings .
Organization IapSettings :
accessSettings:
reauthSettings:
method: "ENROLLED_SECOND_FACTORS"
maxAge: "3600s"
policyType: "MINIMUM"
Folder IapSettings :
accessSettings:
reauthSettings:
method: "LOGIN"
maxAge: "1200s"
policyType: "DEFAULT"
Service or Application IapSettings :
accessSettings:
reauthSettings:
method: "SECURE_KEY"
maxAge: "7200s"
policyType: "DEFAULT"
Settings after merge:
Organization IapSettings :
accessSettings:
reauthSettings:
method: "ENROLLED_SECOND_FACTORS"
maxAge: "3600s"
policyType: "MINIMUM"
Folder IapSettings :
accessSettings:
reauthSettings:
method: "ENROLLED_SECOND_FACTORS"
maxAge: "1200s"
policyType: "MINIMUM"
Service or Application IapSettings :
accessSettings:
reauthSettings:
method: "SECURE_KEY"
maxAge: "1200s"
policyType: "MINIMUM"
In this example, if the policy type of every resource is set to DEFAULT , then
the reauthSettings of the service or application is used.
MaxAge
Use the maxAge parameter to specify how often an end user must reauthenticate,
denoted in seconds. For example, to set a one hour reauthentication policy, set
seconds to 3600, as shown in the following example:
accessSettings:
reauthSettings:
method: "LOGIN"
maxAge: "3600s"
policyType: "MINIMUM"
The minimum value for maxAge is 300 seconds, or five minutes.
To set a reauthentication policy, complete the following steps.
Console
Go to the IAP page .
Go to the Identity-Aware Proxy page
Select a project, and then select the resource that you want to set a
reauthentication policy on.
Open the Settings for the resource and under
Reauthentication policy , select Configure reauthentication .
Specify the reauthentication settings, and then click Save .
gcloud
You can set a reauthentication policy on resources and services at the
organization, project, and folder level. The following are some example
commands for setting a reauthentication policy.
For more information, see gcloud iap settings set .
Run the following command:
gcloud iap settings set SETTING_FILE [--organization= ORGANIZATION --folder= FOLDER --project=/ PROJECT --resource-type= RESOURCE_TYPE --service= SERVICE --version= VERSION
To set a reauthentication policy on the resources within an organization, run
the following command:
gcloud iap settings set SETTING_FILE --organization= ORGANIZATION
To set a reauthentication policy on the resources within a folder, run the
following command:
gcloud iap settings set SETTING_FILE --folder= FOLDER
To set a reauthentication policy on all web type resources within a project,
run the following command:
gcloud iap settings set SETTING_FILE --project= PROJECT --resource-type=iap_web
To set a reauthentication policy on an App Engine service within a project,
run the following command:
gcloud iap settings set SETTING_FILE --project= PROJECT --resource-type=app-engine --service= SERVICE
Where SETTING_FILE is:
accessSettings :
reauthSettings :
method : "LOGIN"
maxAge : "3600s"
policyType : "MINIMUM"
Replace the following:
FOLDER : The folder ID.
ORGANIZATION : The organization ID.
PROJECT : The project ID.
RESOURCE_TYPE : The IAP resource type. Must be
app-engine , iap_web , compute , organization , or folder .
SERVICE : The service name. This is optional when resource-type
is set to compute or app-engine .
VERSION : The version name. This is not applicable for the
compute resource type and is optional for the app-engine resource type.
API
Run the following command to prepare an iap_settings.json file. Update the
values as needed.
cat iap_settings.json
{
"access_settings": {
"reauth_settings": {
"method": "LOGIN",
"maxAge": "300s",
"policy_type": "DEFAULT"
}
}
}
EOF
Get the resource name by running the gcloud iap settings get command. Copy
the name field from the output. You will need the name in the following step.
gcloud iap settings get [--organization=ORGANIZATION --folder=FOLDER --project=/PROJECT --resource-type=RESOURCE_TYPE --service=SERVICE --version=VERSION]
Replace RESOURCE_NAME in the following command with the name from the
previous step. The IapSettings will be updated.
curl -X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d @iap_settings.json \
"https://iap.googleapis.com/v1/RESOURCE_NAME:iapSettings?updateMask=iapSettings.accessSettings.reauthSettings"
Understanding reauthentication credentials
After successful reauthentication, IAP creates a cookie on
the end user's browser. To prevent frequent reauthentication for applications on
the same domain, the cookie is set on the top-level private domain and is valid
for that entire domain.
For example, foo.example.com is an IAP protected resource
and has an IAP reauthentication policy. After a successful
reauthentication, IAP sets a cookie on example.com because
that is the top-level private domain. Applications from the same top-level private
domain, such as bar.example.com use the same reauthentication credentials and
don't prompt the user to reauthenticate as long as the credentials are valid.
For URLs such as myapp.appspot.com , appspot.com is a public
domain, therefore the top-level private domain is myapp.appspot.com .
Known limitations
Reauthentication is only supported for browser flows. Programmatic user account access isn't
supported. For example, mobile and desktop applications cannot reauthenticate
users because the resources that require reauthentication are inaccessible to
these applications.
Service accounts and IAP-TCP are exempt from reauthentication requirements.
Reauthentication does not work with the Identity and Access Management member type allUsers .
External identities , such as OAuth and
SAML, are not supported with reauthentication.
Workforce Identity Federation identities are not supported for IAP
reauthentication.
