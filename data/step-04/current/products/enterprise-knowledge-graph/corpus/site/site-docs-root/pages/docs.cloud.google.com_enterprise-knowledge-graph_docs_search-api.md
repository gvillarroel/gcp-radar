This product is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
You can process personal data for
this product
as outlined in the
Cloud Data
Processing Addendum , subject to the obligations and restrictions described in the
agreement under which you access Google Cloud.
Pre-GA products are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Note: The Google Knowledge Graph Search API returns only individual matching entities,
rather than graphs of interconnected entities. If you need the latter, we
recommend using data dumps from Wikidata instead. Note: The Google Knowledge Graph Search API might return data with license restrictions, which
attach to either license or additionalProperty fields. For more information, see Additional Product Requirements on how you can leverage the data for your use case.
This quickstart introduces you to the Google Knowledge Graph Search API.
In this quickstart, use the API to search or look up entities in Google Knowledge Graph.
If you're planning a new project, build your application with Cloud Knowledge Graph Advanced edition to take advantage of new features and service improvements.
The Basic edition remains available, but doesn't support new features, high QPS, or additional security and compliance standards.
Search Cloud Knowledge Graph entities
The following samples show how to search an entity against the knowledge graph.
Advanced
REST
To search the knowledge graph for the Advanced edition, call the projects.locations.cloudKnowledgeGraphEntities.search method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : Knowledge Graph location.
Options: global - Global Endpoint
SEARCH_QUERY : The literal query string for search.
LANGUAGES : (Optional) The list of language codes (defined in ISO 693) to run the query with. The default value is en if not specified.
TYPES : (Optional) Restricts returned entities with these types, as defined by `https://schema.org`. If multiple types are specified, returned entities will contain one or more of these types. The default value is empty, which will return entities with no type restrictions. Refer to the Schema.org full hierarchy for supported types.
Tip: If you know what you are looking for, use the types filter to narrow down your search.
LIMIT : (Optional) Limits the number of entities to be returned. The default is 20 .
HTTP method and URL:
GET https://enterpriseknowledgegraph.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /cloudKnowledgeGraphEntities:Search?query= SEARCH_QUERY &limit= LIMIT
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ "https://enterpriseknowledgegraph.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /cloudKnowledgeGraphEntities:Search?query= SEARCH_QUERY &limit= LIMIT "
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://enterpriseknowledgegraph.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /cloudKnowledgeGraphEntities:Search?query= SEARCH_QUERY &limit= LIMIT " | Select-Object -Expand Content
The response contains a list of entities, presented in JSON-LD format and compatible with schema.org schemas with limited external extensions .
Refer to Entity Response Structure for more information about the response structure.
The following JSON-LD example shows how the response body is structured:
