This quickstart introduces you to the Entity Reconciliation API.
In this quickstart, you use the Google Cloud console to set up your
Google Cloud project and authentication, create schema mapping files, and then make a
request for Enterprise Knowledge Graph to run an entity reconciliation job.
Create an entity reconciliation job
Use the following steps to create an entity reconciliation job:
REST
To create a simple job with one source table (deduplication), call the projects.locations.entityReconciliationJobs.create method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : Knowledge Graph location.
Options: global - Global Endpoint
DATASET_ID : ID of the BigQuery Dataset
TABLE_ID : ID of the BigQuery Table
MAPPING_FILE_URI : Cloud Storage path to a mapping file in YAML format.
Example: gs://ekg-test-gcs/mapping.yml
ENTITY_TYPE : Entity Type for reconciliation.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://enterpriseknowledgegraph.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /entityReconciliationJobs
Request JSON body:
{
"inputConfig": {
"bigqueryInputConfigs": [
{
"bigqueryTable": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET_ID /tables/ TABLE_ID ",
"gcsUri": " MAPPING_FILE_URI "
}
],
"entityType": " ENTITY_TYPE "
},
"outputConfig": {
"bigqueryDataset": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET_ID "
}
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://enterpriseknowledgegraph.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /entityReconciliationJobs"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://enterpriseknowledgegraph.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /entityReconciliationJobs" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /entityReconciliationJobs/ JOB_ID ",
"inputConfig": {
"bigqueryInputConfigs": [
{
"bigqueryTable": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET_ID /tables/ TABLE_ID ",
"gcsUri": " MAPPING_FILE_URI "
}
],
"entityType": " ENTITY_TYPE "
},
"outputConfig": {
"bigqueryDataset": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET_ID "
},
"state": "JOB_STATE_RUNNING",
"createTime": "2021-07-31T14:39:14.145568Z",
"updateTime": "2021-07-31T14:39:14.145568Z"
}
To create a job with advanced options and multiple BigQuery tables, use a request body similar to this example:
{
"inputConfig": {
"bigqueryInputConfigs": [
{
"bigqueryTable": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET_ID /tables/ TABLE_ID ",
"gcsUri": " MAPPING_FILE_URI "
},
{
"bigqueryTable": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET_ID /tables/ TABLE_ID ",
"gcsUri": " MAPPING_FILE_URI "
}
],
"entityType": " ENTITY_TYPE ",
"previousResultBigqueryTable": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET_ID /tables/clusters_13689265293502324307"
},
"outputConfig": {
"bigqueryDataset": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET_ID "
},
"reconConfig": {
"affinityClusteringConfig": {
"compressionRoundCount": "2"
},
"options": {
"enableGeocodingSeparation": true
}
}
}

Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : Knowledge Graph location.
Options: global - Global Endpoint
JOB_ID : Entity Reconciliation Job ID.
Example: 2628838070002699773
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://enterpriseknowledgegraph.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /entityReconciliationJobs/ JOB_ID :cancel

.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:

To remove a completed or failed job with the API, call the projects.locations.entityReconciliationJobs.delete method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : Knowledge Graph location.
Options: global - Global Endpoint
JOB_ID : Entity Reconciliation Job ID.
