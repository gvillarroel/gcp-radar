HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect lets you encrypt the traffic that traverses your
Dedicated Interconnect or Partner Interconnect connections. To
use HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect, you deploy
HA VPN
tunnels over your VLAN attachments.
With HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect, you can improve the overall security of
your business and maintain compliance with existing and upcoming industry
regulations. For example, you might be required to encrypt the outgoing traffic
from your applications or ensure that data is encrypted in transit over third
parties.
You have many choices in meeting these requirements. Encryption can be performed
at several layers in the OSI stack and at some layers might not be universally
supported. For example, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is not supported for all
TCP-based protocols, and enabling Datagram TLS (DTLS) might not be supported
for all UDP-based protocols. One solution is to implement encryption at the
network layer with the IPsec protocol.
As a solution, HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect has the advantage of providing
deployment tools by using the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, and the
Compute Engine API. You can also use internal IP addresses for your
HA VPN gateways. The VLAN attachments that you create for
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect support connections to
Private Service Connect
endpoints .
Finally, HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect has an SLA that is derived from its
underlying components, Cloud VPN and Cloud Interconnect. For more
information, see SLA .
Another option is to create a self-managed (non-Google Cloud) VPN gateway in
your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network and assign an internal IP address to
each gateway. For example, you can run a strongSwan VPN on a Compute Engine
instance. You then terminate IPsec tunnels to those VPN gateways by using
Cloud Interconnect from an on-premises environment. For more
information about HA VPN options, see
HA VPN
topologies .
You cannot deploy Classic VPN gateways and tunnels over
Cloud Interconnect.
Deployment architecture
When you deploy HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect,
you create two operational tiers:
The Cloud Interconnect tier, which includes the VLAN attachments and
the Cloud Router for Cloud Interconnect.
The HA VPN tier, which includes the
HA VPN gateways and tunnels and the Cloud Router for
HA VPN.
Each tier requires its own Cloud Router:
The Cloud Router for Cloud Interconnect is used exclusively to exchange
VPN gateway prefixes between the VLAN attachments. This Cloud Router is
used only by the VLAN attachments of the Cloud Interconnect tier.
It cannot be used in the HA VPN tier.
The Cloud Router for HA VPN exchanges prefixes between
your VPC network and your on-premises network.
You configure the Cloud Router for HA VPN and its
BGP sessions in the same way you would for a regular HA VPN deployment.
You build the HA VPN tier on top of the Cloud Interconnect
tier. Therefore, the HA VPN tier requires that the Cloud Interconnect
tier, based on either Dedicated Interconnect or Partner Interconnect, is
properly configured and operational.
The following diagram depicts an HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect deployment.
Figure 1. Deployment architecture for HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect (click to enlarge).
The IP address ranges learned by the Cloud Router on the
Cloud Interconnect tier are used to select the
internal traffic sent to the HA VPN gateways and the VLAN attachments.
Failover
The following sections describe different types of
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect failover.
Cloud Interconnect failover
When the BGP session on the Cloud Interconnect tier goes down,
the corresponding HA VPN to Cloud Interconnect routes
are retracted. This retraction leads to HA VPN tunnel interruption.
As a result, routes are shifted to the other HA VPN tunnels
that are hosted on the other VLAN attachment.
The following diagram depicts Cloud Interconnect failover.
Figure 2. Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachment failover for HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect (click to enlarge).
HA VPN tunnel failover
When a BGP session on the HA VPN tier goes down,
normal BGP failover occurs, and HA VPN tunnel traffic
is routed to other available HA VPN tunnels.
The BGP sessions of the Cloud Interconnect tier are unaffected.
The following diagram depicts HA VPN tunnel failover.

SLA
HA VPN
is a high-availability (HA) Cloud VPN solution that lets you securely connect
your on-premises network to your VPC network by using an IPsec
VPN connection in a single Google Cloud region .
HA VPN, deployed on its own, has its own
SLA when properly
configured.
However, because HA VPN is deployed on top of
Cloud Interconnect, the overall SLA for
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect matches the SLA of the
Cloud Interconnect topology that you choose to deploy.
The SLA for HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect depends on the
Cloud Interconnect topology that you choose to deploy. To qualify for
an SLA, your deployments must have a gateway with 2 VLAN attachments associated
( failover ).
Deployments with a single VLAN attachment
There is no SLA for deployments of gateways with a single VLAN attachment.
Multi-region deployment for production-level applications
If the deployment uses a multi-region Cloud Interconnect topology,
the HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect deployment has
an SLA of 99.99%.
For Dedicated Interconnect, see Establish 99.99%
availability for
Dedicated Interconnect .
For Partner Interconnect, see Establish 99.99%
availability for
Partner Interconnect .
Single region deployment for non-critical applications
If the deployment uses a single region Cloud Interconnect topology,
the HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect deployment has an SLA of 99.9%.
For Dedicated Interconnect, see Establish 99.9%
availability for
Dedicated Interconnect .
For Partner Interconnect, see Establish 99.9%
availability for
Partner Interconnect .
Pricing summary
For HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect deployments, you are charged for the
following components:
Your Dedicated Interconnect connection,
if you use Dedicated Interconnect.
Each VLAN attachment.
Each VPN tunnel.
Cloud Interconnect egress traffic only. You are not charged for
the Cloud VPN egress traffic carried by your
HA VPN tunnels.
Regional external IP addresses assigned to your HA VPN gateways,
if you choose to use external IP addresses. However, you are only charged
for the IP addresses that are not in use by VPN tunnels.
For more information,
see Cloud VPN Pricing and
Cloud Interconnect Pricing .
Limitations
Configuration:
The HA VPN gateway is an immutable resource. Once
you create and associate a VLAN attachment, you cannot change the
associations between the attachment and the interfaces of the
HA VPN gateway.
For example, if you decide later that you need to configure for
failover , you must create a new
HA VPN gateway and then delete the original
gateway and its tunnels.
You must select IPsec encryption when you create the VLAN attachment.
You cannot add encryption to an existing attachment at a later time.
For each VLAN attachment, you can reserve only one internal IP address
range for your HA VPN gateway interfaces.
Enabling
Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
does not provide faster failure detection for
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect deployments.
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect supports IPv4 and IPv6 (dual-stack)
HA VPN gateways. To create dual-stack
HA VPN gateways, you must use the Google Cloud CLI
or Cloud Interconnect API. You cannot use the HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect
deployment wizard in the Google Cloud console.
Payload and latency:
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect differentiates between the following
maximum transmission unit (MTU) values:
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect gateway MTU :
1440 bytes.
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect payload
MTU :
is between 1354 to 1386 bytes, depending on the cipher used.
For more information, see Encrypted traffic MTU values .
Each HA VPN tunnel can support up to 250,000 packets per second
for the sum of ingress and egress traffic. This is a limitation of
HA VPN. For more information, see
Limits in the
Cloud VPN documentation.
For a single VLAN attachment with encryption enabled, the combined
inbound and outbound throughput is limited to 50 Gbps.
In terms of latency, adding IPsec encryption to Cloud Interconnect
traffic adds some delay. During normal operations, the added latency is
under 5 milliseconds.
You can terminate the VLAN attachments and IPsec tunnels on two different
physical on-premises devices. The BGP sessions over each VLAN attachment,
advertising and negotiating the VPN gateway prefixes, should terminate on
the on-premises VLAN attachment device. The BGP sessions over each VPN
tunnel, advertising the cloud prefixes (as usual), should terminate on the
VPN device.
The ASNs of the two Cloud Routers can be different.
Cloud Router interfaces that peer with on-premises devices cannot
be assigned RFC 1918 (private) IP addresses.
