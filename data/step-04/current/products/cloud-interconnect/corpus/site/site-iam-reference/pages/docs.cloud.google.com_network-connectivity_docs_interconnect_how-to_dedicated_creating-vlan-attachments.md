What's next
VLAN attachments (also known as interconnectAttachments ) determine which
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks can reach your on-premises network through
a Dedicated Interconnect connection. You can create VLAN attachments
over connections that have
passed all tests
and are ready to use.
You can create unencrypted VLAN attachments or encrypted VLAN attachments.
Encrypted VLAN attachments are used in HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect deployments.
You can create unencrypted VLAN attachments that are single stack (IPv4 only) or
dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6).
By default, when you create an unencrypted VLAN attachment, the VLAN attachment
is single stack (IPv4 only). Unless you specify otherwise, the interface
that you create for your unencrypted VLAN attachment is
a single interface with an IPv4 address and the resulting BGP session exchanges
only IPv4 routes.
If you need to support IPv6 traffic, you must configure a
dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) unencrypted VLAN attachment. With a dual-stack VLAN
attachment, you can create an IPv4 BGP session, an IPv6 BGP session,
or you can create both.
Encrypted VLAN attachments are always configured to be IPv4 only.
If you want to support IPv6 traffic in your encrypted attachments for an
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect deployment, you can deploy
configure dual-stack HA VPN gateways and tunnels.
Billing for VLAN attachments starts when you create them and
stops when you delete them.
If you are using VLAN attachments located in different Google Cloud
regions than your
Dedicated Interconnect connection, then change your
VPC network's dynamic routing
mode
to Global .
VLAN attachments are subject to vlan attachment related quotas . Request a higher quota for increased attachments or bandwidth.
If you need to create a VLAN attachment for a connection in another
Google Cloud project, see
Use Dedicated Interconnect connections in other projects .
For VLAN attachments for Partner Interconnect, see
Create VLAN attachments for Partner Interconnect .
For definitions of terms used on this page, see
Cloud Interconnect key terms .
To help you solve common issues that you might encounter when using
Dedicated Interconnect, see
Troubleshooting .
Associate VLAN attachments with a Cloud Router
For Dedicated Interconnect, the VLAN attachment allocates a
VLAN on a connection and associates that VLAN with the specified
Cloud Router . It is
possible to associate multiple, different VLAN attachments to the same
Cloud Router.
When you create the VLAN attachment, specify a Cloud Router
that's in the region that contains the subnets that you want to reach. The VLAN
attachment automatically allocates a VLAN ID and Border Gateway Protocol
(BGP) peering IP addresses. Use that information to configure your on-premises
router and establish a BGP session with your Cloud Router.
Optionally, you can manually specify link-local candidate subnets for IPv4 BGP
addresses when you create the VLAN attachment. Cloud Router selects
IPv4 addresses from this range for the interface and the BGP peer. These
IPv4 addresses can't be modified after they have been selected.
The BGP IPv4 address range that you specify as a candidate must be unique among all
Cloud Routers in all regions of a VPC network.
Instead of configuring link-local candidate subnets for your IPv4 BGP addresses,
you can specify custom IP addresses for both the Cloud Router and customer
router ends of your VLAN attachments. For more information about custom IP
address ranges, see
Custom IP address ranges .
You can't manually specify candidate subnets for IPv6 addresses when creating
your VLAN attachment, but you can specify custom IP address ranges.
For HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect, you must create
a Cloud Router that is used exclusively with encrypted VLAN attachments.
The Cloud Router only exchanges routes for the VPN gateways over the
VLAN attachments, which ensures that only encrypted traffic egresses the
attachments. You can't use this Cloud Router for any unencrypted VLAN
attachments or for any VPN tunnels.
Utilize multiple VLAN attachments
Each VLAN attachment supports a maximum bandwidth of 400 Gbps in
increments described on the
Pricing page, and a maximum packet
rate as documented in Cloud Interconnect
limits . This is true even if the attachment is
configured on a connection that has a greater bandwidth capacity than the
attachment.
To fully use the bandwidth of a connection, you might need to create
multiple VLAN attachments.
Note: Creating VLAN attachments with a combined bandwidth
greater than the Dedicated Interconnect connection doesn't
give you more than the maximum stated bandwidth of the connection:
To use a 20-Gbps attachment, you need at least a 2 x 10-Gbps
Dedicated Interconnect connection or a 100-Gbps connection.
To use a 50-Gbps attachment, you need at least a 5 x 10-Gbps
Dedicated Interconnect connection or a 100-Gbps connection.
To use multiple VLAN attachments simultaneously for egress
traffic in a VPC network, create them in the same region. Then
configure your on-premises router to advertise routes with the same MED. The
custom dynamic routes, learned through BGP sessions on one or more
Cloud Routers that manage the VLAN attachments, are applied to your
VPC network with a route priority corresponding to the MED.
When multiple available routes have the same priority, Google Cloud
distributes traffic among them by using a five-tuple hash for affinity,
implementing an equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing design. For more information,
see Applicability and order in the
VPC documentation.

More
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Interconnect VLAN
attachments tab.
Go to VLAN attachments
Click Create VLAN attachments .
Select Dedicated Interconnect connection
In the Encrypt interconnect section, select Set up unencrypted Interconnect ,
and then click Continue .
To create attachments in your project, in the Select interconnects & redundancy
section, select In this project . For other projects, see
Use Dedicated Interconnect connections in other projects .
Select an existing Dedicated Interconnect connection in your project,
and then click Continue .
Select Add VLAN attachment , and then specify the following details:
Name : A name for the attachment. This name is displayed
in the Google Cloud console and is used by the Google Cloud CLI to
reference the attachment—for example, my-attachment .
Description (optional): A description of the attachment.
Select a stack type for the attachment, either IPv4 (single stack)
or IPv4 and IPv6 (dual stack) .
Select a Cloud Router to associate with
this attachment. The Cloud Router must be in the
VPC network that you want to connect to.
If you don't have an existing Cloud Router, select
Create new router . For the BGP AS number, use any private ASN
( 64512-65534 or 4200000000-4294967294 ) or 16550 .
Optional: To specify a VLAN ID, a specific IP address range for the BGP session,
the VLAN attachment's capacity, or the maximum transmission unit (MTU),
click VLAN ID, BGP IPs, capacity, MTU .
To specify a VLAN ID, in the VLAN ID section, select Customize .
By default, Google automatically generates a VLAN ID. You can
specify a VLAN ID in the range 2-4093. You can't specify a VLAN
ID that is already in use on the connection. If your
VLAN ID is in use, you are asked to choose another one.
If you don't enter a VLAN ID, an unused, random VLAN ID is
automatically selected for the VLAN attachment.
To specify an IPv4 address range for the BGP session, in the
Allocate BGP IPv4 address section, select Specify a candidate
link-local range or Specify custom IP address , then enter an
IP address range or an IP address respectively.
Candidate link-local range : The BGP IPv4 address range that you
specify must be unique among all Cloud Routers in all
regions of a VPC network.
IPv4 addresses used for the BGP session between a Cloud Router
and your on-premises router are allocated from the IPv4 link-local
address space ( 169.254.0.0/16 ). By default, Google selects unused
addresses from the IPv4 link-local address space.
To restrict the IPv4 range that Google selects from, you can
specify up to 16 prefixes from the IPv4 link-local address space.
All prefixes must reside within 169.254.0.0/16 and must have
a prefix length of /29 or shorter, for example, /29 or /28 .
An unused /29 range is automatically selected from your
specified prefix. The address allocation request fails if all
possible /29 ranges are in use by Google Cloud.
If you don't supply a range of prefixes, Google Cloud picks a
/29 address allocation from 169.254.0.0/16 that is not already
used by any BGP session in your VPC network. If you
supply one or more prefixes, Google Cloud picks an unused
/29 address allocation from the supplied prefixes.
After the /29 address range is selected, Google Cloud
assigns the Cloud Router one address and your on-premises
router another address. The rest of the address space in the /29
prefix is reserved for Google's use.
Custom IP address : For more information about prerequisites,
limitations and why you might use custom IP address ranges, see
Custom IP address ranges .
Note that you can't combine custom IPv4 addresses with candidate
subnets. In addition, if you use the dual stack stack
type, you can choose to set custom IP addresses for only your IPv4
addresses, only your IPv6 addresses, or both your IPv4 and IPv6
addresses; you can combine custom IP addresses in one field with
automatic allocation or candidate link-local ranges in the other
field if those options are available.
In the Cloud Router IP field, enter the IPv4 CIDR
address that you want to assign to the Cloud Router end of your
VLAN attachment, like 192.0.2.1/29 . Then, in the Peer IP field,
enter the IPv4 CIDR address that you want to assign to the customer
router end of your VLAN attachment.
If you selected IPv4 and IPv6 (dual stack) , you must also select
one of the options in the Allocate BGP IPv6 address section. In
the Cloud Router IPv6 field, enter the
IPv6 CIDR address that you want to assign to the Cloud Router end
of your VLAN attachment, like 2001:db8::1/125 . Then, in the
Peer IPv6 field, enter the IPv6 CIDR address that you want to
assign to the customer router end of your VLAN attachment.
To specify the maximum bandwidth, in the Capacity field, select a
value. If you don't select a value, Cloud Interconnect uses
10 Gbps.
If you have multiple VLAN attachments on a connection,
the capacity setting helps you control how much bandwidth each
attachment can use. The maximum bandwidth is approximate, so it's
possible for VLAN attachments to use more bandwidth than the
selected capacity.
To specify the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the attachment,
select a value from the field.
To make use of a 1460-, 1500-, or 8896-byte MTU, the
VPC network that uses the attachment must set an MTU to
the same value . In addition, the on-premises
virtual machine (VM) instances and
routers must set their MTU to the same value. If your network has the
default MTU of 1460 , then select an MTU of 1460 for your
attachment.
If you want to connect multiple VPC networks (for example, to build
redundancy), click + Add VLAN attachment to attach additional VLANs
to your connection. Choose a different Cloud Router
for each VLAN attachment. For more information, see the
Redundancy section
in the overview.
When you have created all needed VLAN attachments, click Create . The
attachment takes a few moments to create.
The Configure BGP sessions page shows each VLAN
attachment and its configuration status.
For each VLAN attachment, create a BGP session to
exchange BGP routes between your Cloud Router network and your
on-premises router. Click Configure , and then enter the following
information:
Name : A name for the BGP session.
Peer ASN : The public or private ASN of your on-premises
router.
Advertised route priority (MED) (optional): The base value that
Cloud Router uses to calculate route metrics. All routes
advertised for this session use this base value. For more information,
see Advertised prefixes and priorities .
BGP peer : Lets you enable or disable the BGP session with this peer.
If disabled, this Cloud Router does not send BGP connection
requests and rejects all BGP connection requests from this peer.
MD5 authentication (optional): Lets you authenticate BGP sessions
between Cloud Router and its peers. For instructions about
how to use MD5 authentication, see Use MD5 authentication .
Custom advertised routes (optional):
Lets you choose which routes Cloud Router advertises to your
on-premises router through BGP. For
configuration steps, see the overview for custom advertised
routes .
Custom learned routes :
Lets you manually define additional learned routes for a BGP session.
The Cloud Router behaves as if it learned the routes
from the BGP peer.
Bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) for
Cloud Router (optional):
Detects forwarding path outages such as link down
events, allowing for more resilient hybrid networks. For instructions
about how to update a BGP session to use BFD, see
Configuring BFD .
Important: BFD can only be enabled on provisioned VLAN
attachments that use Dataplane version 2. You can view the dataplaneVersion for a
VLAN attachment by viewing the attachment details in one of the following ways:
API : Use the
interconnectAttachments.get
method. You can use this method on VLAN attachments for either
Dedicated Interconnect or Partner Interconnect.
Google Cloud CLI : Use the gcloud compute interconnects attachments describe
ATTACHMENT-NAME command where ATTACHMENT-NAME is the name
of the VLAN attachment for either Dedicated Interconnect or
Partner Interconnect.
In the output of the API or gcloud CLI command, look for the
dataplaneVersion field with a value of 2 . If the field is absent
from the output, the VLAN attachment is using version 1 and cannot be used with BFD. For more
information, contact your customer account team.
The Cloud Interconnect Dataplane v2 is unrelated to
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Dataplane V2
Click Save and continue .
After you add BGP sessions for all your VLAN attachments, click
Save configuration . The BGP sessions that you configured are inactive
until you configure BGP on your on-premises router.
Before you create a VLAN attachment, you must have an existing
Cloud Router in the network and region that you want to reach from
your on-premises network. If you don't have an existing
Cloud Router, create
one .
The Cloud Router must have a BGP ASN of 16550 , or you can use any
private ASN ( 64512-65534 or 4200000000-4294967294 ).
Create a VLAN attachment. The attachment allocates a VLAN on your
connection that connects to the Cloud Router.
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--interconnect= INTERCONNECT_NAME
Replace the following:
ATTACHMENT_NAME : the name of your VLAN attachment
REGION : the region that your
Cloud Router is located in
ROUTER_NAME : the name of the
Cloud Router that this VLAN attachment connects to
INTERCONNECT_NAME : the name of your
Dedicated Interconnect connection
Dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) VLAN attachment
To create a dual-stack VLAN attachment that can support both IPv4 and
IPv6 traffic, specify --stack-type IPV4_IPV6 :
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--interconnect= INTERCONNECT_NAME \
--stack-type=IPV4_IPV6
When you create a VLAN attachment with the IPV4_IPV6 (dual stack)
stack type, Google Cloud automatically assigns an unused /125
CIDR from the 2600:2d00:0:1::/64 range as the IPv6 address for the
VLAN attachment.
If you select the IPV4_IPV6 (dual stack) stack type, you can configure
the VLAN attachment later with an IPv4 BGP session, an IPv6 BGP session,
or both.
If you omit the --stack-type flag, the VLAN attachment is configured
as an IPv4-only (single stack) attachment. An IPV4_ONLY (single stack)
VLAN attachment can exchange only IPv4 routes. You can also
change the stack type of an attachment after you create it. See Modify
stack
type .
Allocate IPv4 addresses for BGP peering
For BGP peering, Google can allocate unused IPv4
addresses from the IPv4 link-local address space ( 169.254.0.0/16 ).
To constrain the range of IPv4 addresses that Google can select from,
you can use the --candidate-subnets flag, as shown in the following
example.
The BGP peering IPv4 address range that you specify must be unique among
all Cloud Routers in all regions of a VPC
network.
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--interconnect= INTERCONNECT_NAME \
--candidate-subnets= CANDIDATE_SUBNETS
Replace CANDIDATE_SUBNETS with a comma-delimited list
link-local IP address ranges that Google Cloud uses for the BGP
session that managed routes for the VLAN attachment—for example,
169.254.0.0/29,169.254.10.0/24 .
You can specify a range of up to 16 prefixes from the IPv4 link-local
address space. All prefixes must reside within 169.254.0.0/16 and must
be a /29 or shorter, for example, /28 or /27 . An unused /29 is
automatically selected from your specified range of prefixes. The
address allocation request fails if all possible /29 prefixes are in
use by Google Cloud.
You can specify candidate subnet ranges for IPv4 addresses only.
You can't specify a candidate subnet range for IPv6
addresses.
Configure custom IP address ranges
If you want to use custom IP address ranges, add the
--candidate-customer-router-ip-address and
--candidate-cloud-router-ip-address flags, which also support
link-local IP addresses. Note that you can't combine these flags with
the --candidate-subnets and --subnet-length fields, but you can use
--candidate-subnets for link-local IPv4 attachments with the
--candidate-customer-router-ipv6-address and
--candidate-cloud-router-ipv6-address flags.
For more information about prerequisites, limitations and
why you might use custom IP address ranges, see
Custom IP address ranges .
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--region= REGION \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--candidate-cloud-router-ip-address= CANDIDATE_CLOUD_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS \
--candidate-customer-router-ip-address= CANDIDATE_CUSTOMER_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS
Replace the following:
CANDIDATE_CLOUD_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS : the IPv4 CIDR
address that you want to assign to the Cloud Router end of your VLAN
attachment, like 192.0.2.1/29
CANDIDATE_CUSTOMER_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS : the IPv4 CIDR
address that you want to assign to the customer router end of your VLAN
attachment
If you use IPv6 dual-stack attachments, use the following
command:
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--region= REGION \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--stack-type=IPV4_IPV6 \
--candidate-cloud-router-ipv6-address= CANDIDATE_CLOUD_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS \
--candidate-customer-router-ipv6-address= CANDIDATE_CUSTOMER_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS
Replace the following:
CANDIDATE_CLOUD_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS : the IPv6 CIDR
address that you want to assign to the Cloud Router end of your
VLAN attachment, like 2001:db8::1/125
CANDIDATE_CUSTOMER_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS : the IPv6 CIDR
address that you want to assign to the customer router end of your
VLAN attachment
You can use the --candidate-cloud-router-ip-address and
--candidate-customer-router-ip-address flags alongside the
--candidate-cloud-router-ipv6-address and
--candidate-customer-router-ipv6-address flags to create an
attachment that uses both IPv4 and IPv6 custom address ranges.
VLAN ID configuration
To specify a VLAN ID, use the --vlan flag, as shown in the following
example:
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--interconnect= INTERCONNECT_NAME \
--vlan=5
By default, Google automatically generates a VLAN ID. You can specify a
VLAN ID in the range 2-4093. You can't specify a VLAN ID that is
already in use on the Dedicated Interconnect connection.
If your VLAN ID is in
use, you are asked to choose another one.
If you don't enter a VLAN ID, an unused, random VLAN ID is automatically
selected for the VLAN attachment.
Maximum bandwidth configuration
To specify the attachment's maximum bandwidth, use the --bandwidth
flag, as shown in the following example. If you have multiple VLAN
attachments on a connection, the capacity setting helps you
control how much bandwidth each attachment can use. The maximum
bandwidth is approximate, so it's possible for VLAN attachments to use
more bandwidth than the selected capacity.
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--interconnect= INTERCONNECT_NAME \
--bandwidth=500M
If you don't specify a capacity, Cloud Interconnect uses the
default of 10 Gbps. For more information, see the
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create reference.
MTU configuration
The default MTU of an attachment is 1440 bytes. You can also specify an
attachment MTU of 1460, 1500, or 8896 bytes. To specify an MTU of 1460,
1500, or 8896 bytes for the attachment, use the --mtu flag, as shown
in the following example:
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--interconnect= INTERCONNECT_NAME \
--mtu=1500
To make use of a 1460, 1500 or 8896-byte MTU, the VPC
network that uses the attachment and the on-premises systems and routers
must all have the same MTU value set .
Describe the attachment to retrieve the resources that it allocated, such
as the VLAN ID and BGP peering addresses, as shown in the following

The cloudRouterIpAddress value ( 169.254.180.81/29 ) is an IPv4
link-local address. When you create a Cloud Router
interface for this attachment, the interface uses this IP address.
You use this same address for the BGP neighbor on your on-premises
router.
The customerRouterIpAddress value ( 169.254.180.82/29 ) is an IPv4
link-local address. On the Cloud Router, configure a BGP
peer with this address over the interface that has the
Cloud Router address assigned to it. You assign this
address to the VLAN subinterface on your on-premises router.
The stackType value ( IPV4_ONLY ) indicates the type of traffic
supported by the VLAN attachment.
The vlanTag8021q value ( 1000 ) identifies traffic that goes
across this attachment. You need this value to configure a tagged
VLAN subinterface on your on-premises router.
On your Cloud Router, add the interface or interfaces
that connect to the VLAN attachment.
If your VLAN attachment is IPv4-only, you must create
an interface with an IPv4 address.
If your VLAN attachment uses the IPV4_IPV6 (dual stack) stack type,
you can create an interface with an IPv4 address, an interface with an
IPv6 address, or you can create both.
Creating both an interface with an IPv4 address and an interface with
an IPv6 address lets you run two BGP sessions in parallel over the
same VLAN attachment. For more information, see
Establish BGP sessions
in the Cloud Router documentation.
To create an interface with an IPv4 address, run the following command.
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--interface-name= IPV4_INTERFACE_NAME \
--interconnect-attachment= ATTACHMENT_NAME
Replace IPV4_INTERFACE_NAME with a name for this
interface.
The IPv4 address of an interface is automatically configured
using your attachment's cloudRouterIpAddress .
To create an interface with an IPv6 address, run the following command.
gcloud beta compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--interface-name= IPV6_INTERFACE_NAME \
--interconnect-attachment= ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--ip-version=IPV6
Replace IPV6_INTERFACE_NAME with a name for this
interface.
The IPv6 address of an interface is automatically
configured using your attachment's cloudRouterIpv6Address .
Add a BGP peer for each interface that you created:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--interface= IPV4_INTERFACE_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--peer-name= IPV4_BGP_PEER_NAME \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN
Replace the following:
IPV4_BGP_PEER_NAME : a name for this BGP peer.
PEER_ASN : the same ASN that you configured
on your on-premises router.
The BGP peer's IPv4 address is automatically configured using your
attachment's customerRouterIpAddress .
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--interface= IPV6_INTERFACE_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--peer-name= IPV6_BGP_PEER_NAME \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN
Replace IPV6_BGP_PEER_NAME with a name for this
BGP peer.
The peer's IPv6 address is automatically configured using
your attachment's customerRouterIpv6Address .
Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) configuration
If you configured the VLAN attachment with the IPV4_IPV6 (dual stack)
stack type, you can use multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) in your single IPv4
BGP or single IPv6 BGP session. You can't use MP-BGP if you're using both
BGP sessions.
With MP-BGP, you can exchange IPv6 routes over an IPv4 BGP session or
you can exchange IPv4 routes over an IPv6 BGP session.
To enable IPv6 route exchange in an IPv4 BGP session, run the following
command.
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--interface= IPV4_INTERFACE_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--peer-name= IPV4_BGP_PEER_NAME \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--enable-ipv6
If you omit the --enable-ipv6 flag, the IPv4 BGP session exchanges only
IPv4 routes. You can also enable IPv6 route exchange in the BGP session
at a later time.
To enable IPv4 route exchange in an IPv6 BGP session, run the following
command.
gcloud beta compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--interface= IPV6_INTERFACE_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--peer-name= IPV6_BGP_PEER_NAME \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--enable-ipv4
For more information, see Configure multiprotocol BGP for IPv4 or
IPv6 BGP
sessions .
If you enable IPv6 route exchange in your IPv4 BGP session,
you must configure your on-premises router to advertise its IPv6 routes
with your attachment's customerRouterIpv6Address as the next hop.
If you enable IPv4 route exchange in your IPv6 BGP session,
you must configure your on-premises router to advertise its IPv4 routes
with your attachment's customerRouterIpAddress as the next hop.
Describe the attachment to retrieve the IPv4 or IPv6 next hop address.

Custom advertised route and MED value configuration
To specify a base MED value, use the --advertised-route-priority
flag. Cloud Router uses this value to calculate route metrics
for all routes that it advertises for this session. For more
information, see Advertised prefixes and priorities
in the Cloud Router documentation.
You can also use the --advertisement-mode flag to enable
custom advertisement mode
for this BGP session. Use --advertisement-groups and
--advertisement-ranges to define the custom advertised routes
for the BGP session. Custom advertised routes let you
choose which routes Cloud Router advertises to your
on-premises router through BGP.
You can specify both IPv4 and IPv6 custom advertised routes.
However, IPv6 custom advertised routes are advertised only in
BGP sessions where IPv6 route exchange is enabled.
IPv4 custom advertised routes are advertised only in BGP
sessions where IPv4 route exchange is enabled.
For configuration steps, see the
overview for custom advertised routes .
Custom learned route configuration
If you want to configure custom learned routes, use the
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges flag. You can also optionally use
the --custom-learned-route-priority flag to set a MED value for the
routes. Each BGP session can have MED value that applies to all the
custom learned routes that you configured for the session. When you use
this feature, the Cloud Router behaves as if it learned these
routes from the BGP peer. For more information about how learned routes
work in VPC, see Learned
routes .

IP_PREFIXES : a comma-separated list of IP address
prefixes—for example, 1.2.3.4,6.7.0.0/16
MED_VALUE : a MED value for the specified IP
prefixes. You can set a MED value between 0 and 65535 inclusive.
MD5 authentication configuration
If you want to use MD5 authentication, add the md5-authentication-key
flag. For more information about this feature, see
Use MD5 authentication .
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--interface=my-router-i1-intf-v4 \
--region= REGION \
--peer-name= BGP_PEER_NAME \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--md5-authentication-key= MD5_AUTHENTICATION_KEY
Replace MD5_AUTHENTICATION_KEY with the MD5
authentication key for this BGP peer.
Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
If you want to add Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
for Cloud Router, you can configure your BGP peer with a BFD
session.
BFD detects forwarding path outages such as link
down events, allowing for more resilient hybrid networks. To update
your BGP session to use BFD, see
Configuring BFD for Cloud Router .
If you're building redundancy with a duplicate Dedicated Interconnect
connection, repeat these steps for the second connection and specify the same
Cloud Router. For more information, see
Redundancy and SLA .

of your VLAN attachment.
In the Capacity field, select the maximum bandwidth for each VLAN
attachment. The value that you select for VLAN attachment 1 is
automatically applied to VLAN attachment 2 .
If you don't select a value, Cloud Interconnect uses 10 Gbps.
The capacity that you select determines how many HA VPN
tunnels you need to deploy.
In the VPN Gateway IP addresses section, select the type of IP addresses to use
for your HA VPN tunnel interfaces.
If you select Internal regional IP addresses , click
Add new IP address range , and enter a Name and IP range .
For the IP range , specify a regional internal IPv4 range with a
prefix length between 26 and 29 . The prefix length determines
the number of IPv4 addresses available for the VPN tunnel interfaces and
must be based on the capacity of the attachment.
For more information, see
Assign internal IP address ranges to HA VPN gateways .
If you select External regional IP addresses , Cloud Interconnect
automatically assigns regional external IP addresses to the HA VPN
tunnel interfaces that you create on your VLAN attachment.
Both VLAN attachments must use the same type of addressing, either internal or
external, for their VPN gateway IPv4 addresses.
When you have created both VLAN attachments, click Create . The
attachments take a few moments to create.
The Configure interconnect router page shows each VLAN
attachment and its configuration status.
For each VLAN attachment, to create a BGP session to
exchange routes between your Cloud Router network and your
on-premises router, click Configure , and then enter the following
information:
Name : A name for the BGP session.
Peer ASN : The public or private ASN of your on-premises
router.
Advertised route priority (MED) (optional): The base value that
Cloud Router uses to calculate route metrics. All routes
advertised for this session use this base value. For more information,
see Advertised prefixes and priorities .
This Cloud Router only advertises routes for
HA VPN and peer VPN tunnel interfaces.
BGP peer : Lets you enable or disable the BGP session with this peer.
If disabled, this Cloud Router does not send BGP connection
requests and rejects all BGP connection requests from this peer.
MD5 authentication (optional): Lets you authenticate BGP sessions
between Cloud Router and its peers. For instructions about
how to use MD5 authentication, see Use MD5 authentication .
Don't enable Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) .
Enabling BFD at the Cloud Interconnect level does
not provide faster failure detection for HA VPN
tunnel traffic.
Click Save and continue .
After you add BGP sessions for all your VLAN attachments, click
Save configuration . The BGP sessions that you configured are inactive

Cloud Interconnect.
Create the Cloud Router in the network and region that you want
to reach from your on-premises network.
Specify the --encrypted-interconnect-router flag to identify
this router to use with the HA VPN
over Cloud Interconnect deployment.
gcloud compute routers create ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--network= NETWORK_NAME \
--asn= ROUTER_ASN \
--encrypted-interconnect-router
Replace the following:
ROUTER_NAME : a name for your
Cloud Router—for example, interconnect-router .
NETWORK_NAME : a name for this network—for
example, network-a .
ROUTER_ASN : an ASN for this router. The
Cloud Router must have a BGP ASN of 16550 , or you can use
any private ASN ( 64512-65534 or 4200000000-4294967294 ).
Optional: Reserve a regional internal IPv4 range with a
prefix length between 26 and 29 .
The prefix length determines
the number of IPv4 addresses available for the VPN gateway interfaces.
The number of IPv4 addresses you need to reserve depends on the capacity
of the associated VLAN attachment.
For example, to reserve a range for the first VLAN attachment with a
10-Gbps capacity:
gcloud compute addresses create IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--addresses=192.168.1.0 \
--prefix-length=29 \
--network= NETWORK_NAME \
--purpose=IPSEC_INTERCONNECT
Replace IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_NAME_1 with a name for this
IP address range.
To reserve an address range for the second VLAN attachment:
gcloud compute addresses create IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_NAME_2 \
--region= REGION \
--addresses=192.168.2.0 \
--prefix-length=29 \
--network= NETWORK_NAME \
--purpose=IPSEC_INTERCONNECT
Replace IP_ADDRESS_RANGE_NAME_2 with a name for this
IP address range.
For more information about reserving regional internal addresses, see
Assign internal IP address ranges to HA VPN
gateways .
Create the first encrypted VLAN attachment, specifying the names
of your first connection and the encrypted Cloud Router:
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--router= INTERCONNECT_ROUTER_NAME \
--interconnect= INTERCONNECT_NAME_1 \
--bandwidth=10g \
--encryption=IPSEC \
--ipsec-internal-addresses= IP_RANGE_1
Replace the following:
INTERCONNECT_NAME_1 : the name of the
Cloud Interconnect this attachment belongs to.
IP_RANGE_1 : the IP range for this
attachment—for example, the regional internal IPv4 address
range ip-range-1 .
If you want to use regional external IPv4 addresses for the
HA VPN gateway interfaces on your attachment, omit
the --ipsec-internal-addresses flag. All HA VPN
gateway interfaces are automatically assigned regional external IPv4
addresses.
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--router= INTERCONNECT_ROUTER_NAME \
--interconnect= INTERCONNECT_NAME_1 \
--bandwidth=10g \
--encryption=IPSEC
You can't set a custom MTU ( --mtu ) with encrypted VLAN attachments.
All encrypted VLAN attachments must use an MTU of 1440 bytes, which is
the default value.
In addition, you can't create dual-stack VLAN attachments for
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect. Encrypted VLAN attachments only
support the IPV4_ONLY (single stack) stack type.
Configure custom IP address ranges
If you want to use custom IP address ranges, add the
--candidate-customer-router-ip-address and
--candidate-cloud-router-ip-address flags, which also support
link-local IP addresses. Note that you can't combine these flags with
the --candidate-subnets and --subnet-length fields, but you can use
--candidate-subnets for link-local IPv4 attachments with the
--candidate-customer-router-ipv6-address and
--candidate-cloud-router-ipv6-address flags.
For more information about prerequisites, limitations and
why you might use custom IP address ranges, see
Custom IP address ranges .
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME_1 \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--region= REGION \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--encryption=IPSEC \
--candidate-cloud-router-ip-address= CANDIDATE_CLOUD_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS \
--candidate-customer-router-ip-address= CANDIDATE_CUSTOMER_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS
Replace the following:
CANDIDATE_CLOUD_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS : the IPv4 CIDR
address that you want to assign to the Cloud Router end of your VLAN
attachment, like 192.0.2.1/29
CANDIDATE_CUSTOMER_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS : the IPv4 CIDR
address that you want to assign to the customer router end of your VLAN
attachment
If you use IPv6 dual-stack attachments, use the following
command:
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME_1 \
--project= PROJECT_ID \
--region= REGION \
--router= ROUTER_NAME \
--stack-type=IPV4_IPV6 \
--encryption=IPSEC \
--candidate-cloud-router-ipv6-address= CANDIDATE_CLOUD_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS \
--candidate-customer-router-ipv6-address= CANDIDATE_CUSTOMER_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS
Replace the following:
CANDIDATE_CLOUD_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS : the IPv6 CIDR
address that you want to assign to the Cloud Router end of your
VLAN attachment, like 2001:db8::1/125
CANDIDATE_CUSTOMER_ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS : the IPv6 CIDR
address that you want to assign to the customer router end of your
VLAN attachment
You can use the --candidate-cloud-router-ip-address and
--candidate-customer-router-ip-address flags alongside the
--candidate-cloud-router-ipv6-address and
--candidate-customer-router-ipv6-address flags to create an
attachment that uses both IPv4 and IPv6 custom address ranges.
Create the second encrypted VLAN attachment, specifying the names
of your second Cloud Interconnect connection and the
Cloud Router for Cloud Interconnect:
gcloud compute interconnects attachments dedicated create ATTACHMENT_NAME_2 \
--region= REGION \
--router= INTERCONNECT_ROUTER_NAME \
--interconnect= INTERCONNECT_NAME_2 \
--bandwidth=10g \
--encryption=IPSEC \
--ipsec-internal-addresses= IP_RANGE_2
Replace the following:
INTERCONNECT_NAME_2 : the name of the
Cloud Interconnect this attachment belongs to.
IP_RANGE_2 : the IP range for this
attachment—for example, the regional internal IPv4 address
range ip-range-2 .
When creating the second VLAN attachment, specify the same type of IPv4
addressing scheme, either internal or external,
that you used when you created the first attachment. If you specified
an internal address range for the first attachment, specify a different
reserved internal IPv4 address range.
Describe the attachment to retrieve the resources that it allocated, such
as the VLAN ID and BGP peering IPv4 addresses, as shown in the following
example. Use these values to configure your Cloud Router and
your on-premises router.
For the first VLAN attachment:

The cloudRouterIpAddress values ( 169.254.61.89/29 and
169.254.116.185/29 ) are IPv4 link-local addresses. When you create
Cloud Router interfaces for the attachments, the interfaces
use these IP addresses. You use the same addresses for the BGP
neighbor on your on-premises router.
customerRouterIpAddress values ( 169.254.61.90/29 and
169.254.116.186/29 ) are IPv4 link-local addresses. On the
Cloud Router, configure a BGP peer with these addresses
over the interfaces that have the Cloud Router addresses
assigned to them. You assign these addresses to the VLAN
subinterface on your on-premises router.
stackType value ( IPV4_ONLY ) indicates the type of traffic
supported by the VLAN attachment.
vlanTag8021q value ( 1000 ) identifies traffic that goes across
this attachment. You need this value to configure a tagged VLAN
subinterface on your on-premises router.
On your Cloud Router, add two interfaces.
Each interface connects to one of the VLAN attachments.
The interface IP address is automatically
configured by using your attachment's cloudRouterIpAddress .
gcloud compute routers add-interface INTERCONNECT_ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--interconnect-attachment= ATTACHMENT_NAME_1
gcloud compute routers add-interface INTERCONNECT_ROUTER \
--region= REGION \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_2 \
--interconnect-attachment= ATTACHMENT_NAME_2
Replace the following:
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 : a name for the first
Cloud Router interface.
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_2 : a name for the second
Cloud Router interface.
Add BGP peers to the interfaces.
The peer IPv4 addresses are automatically configured by using the
customerRouterIpAddress of your attachments.
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--peer-name= BGP_PEER_NAME \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN
Replace PEER_ASN with the same ASN that you configured
on your on-premises router.
To specify a base priority value, use the --advertised-route-priority
flag. Cloud Router uses this value to calculate route metrics
for all routes that it advertises for this session. For more
information, see Advertised prefixes and priorities
in the Cloud Router documentation.
If you want to configure custom learned routes, use the
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges flag. You can also optionally use
the --custom-learned-route-priority flag. Each BGP session can
have one priority value that applies to all the custom learned routes
that you configured for the session. When you use this feature, the
Cloud Router behaves as if it learned these routes from the BGP
peer. For more information, see
Custom learned routes .
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer my-router \
--interface= INTERCONNECT_ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--peer-name= BGP_PEER_NAME \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges= IP_PREFIXES \
--custom-learned-route-priority= MED_VALUE
Replace the following:
IP_PREFIXES : a comma-separated list of IP address
prefixes—for example, 1.2.3.4,6.7.0.0/16
MED_VALUE : a MED value for the specified IP
prefixes. You can set a MED value between 0 and 65535 inclusive.
If you want to use MD5 authentication, add the md5-authentication-key
flag. For more
information about this feature, see
Use MD5 authentication .
Do not enable Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) .
Enabling BFD at the Cloud Interconnect level does
not provide faster failure detection for HA VPN
tunnel traffic.
Complete the HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect deployment by configuring
HA VPN for your VLAN attachments.
See Configure HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect .
VLAN attachment groups
You can group your VLAN attachments within a VLAN attachment group, which
provides information about configuration issues that can prevent your
deployment from qualifying for your intended level of reliability. When you
create a VLAN attachment group, it can be empty. You can add members to the
VLAN attachment group when you create it, and you can add and remove members
after the group is created.
Create VLAN attachment groups
Use this procedure to create a new VLAN attachment group. You need the
compute.interconnectAttachmentGroups.create permission to create a new
attachment group.
Console gcloud
More
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Interconnect
VLAN attachments tab.
Go to VLAN attachments
In the Attachment groups field, click Create group .
Specify the details of the VLAN attachment group:
Name : a name for the VLAN attachment group. This name is displayed
in the Google Cloud console and is used by the Google Cloud CLI to
reference the group, such as my-group .
Description : an optional description of the VLAN attachment group.
In the Production SLA field, select one of the intended SLA
options.
In the Group members field, select the VLAN attachments that you
want to add to the attachment group from each numbered Attachment
box.
Optional: You can click Add attachment to add more attachments than
you are required to add based on your intended SLA.
Click Save .
In the following example, you create an empty VLAN attachment group called
GROUP_NAME with an intended reliability level of
INTENDED_SLA :
gcloud compute interconnects attachments groups create GROUP_NAME \
--intended_availability_sla INTENDED_SLA
In this example, you create a VLAN attachment group with two existing VLAN attachments,
one named ATTACHMENT_1 in REGION_1 and the
other named ATTACHMENT_2 in REGION_2 .
gcloud compute interconnects attachments groups create GROUP_NAME \
--intended_availability_sla INTENDED_SLA \
--attachments= REGION_1 / ATTACHMENT_1 , REGION_2 / ATTACHMENT_2
Add VLAN attachments to a VLAN attachment group
Use this procedure to add VLAN attachments to the VLAN attachment group that you
created in the previous section. You need the
compute.interconnectAttachmentGroups.get and
compute.interconnectAttachmentGroups.update permissions to add VLAN
attachments to an attachment group.
Console gcloud
More
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Interconnect
VLAN attachments tab.
Go to VLAN attachments
Select the VLAN attachment group that you want to edit.
Click Edit .
In the Group members field, click Add attachment .
In the box, choose the VLAN attachment that you want to add to the group.
Optional: Repeat the previous steps for each additional attachment that
you want to add to the group.
Click Done .
In the following example, you add two new VLAN attachments to the group with
the name GROUP_NAME :
gcloud compute interconnects attachments groups add-members GROUP_NAME \
--attachments= REGION_1 / ATTACHMENT_1 , REGION_2 / ATTACHMENT_2
Replace the following values:
GROUP_NAME : the name of your attachment group
REGION_1 : the name of the region of the first VLAN attachment
ATTACHMENT_1 : the name of the first VLAN attachment that
you want to create within this attachment group
REGION_2 : the name of the region of the second VLAN attachment
ATTACHMENT_2 : the name of the second VLAN attachment that
you want to create within this attachment group
Remove VLAN attachments from a VLAN attachment group
Use this procedure to remove VLAN attachments from the VLAN attachment group
that you created in the previous section. You need the
compute.interconnectAttachmentGroups.get and
compute.interconnectAttachmentGroups.update permissions to remove VLAN
attachments from an attachment group.
Console gcloud
More
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Interconnect
VLAN attachments tab.
Go to VLAN attachments
Select the VLAN attachment group that you want to edit.
Click Edit group .
In the Group members field, click the box with the
VLAN attachment that you want to remove from the group, and either replace the selected
VLAN attachment connection with another VLAN attachment or click
delete Delete .
Click Done .
In the following example, you remove two VLAN attachments from the group with
the name GROUP_NAME :
gcloud compute interconnects attachments groups remove-members GROUP_NAME \
--attachments= REGION_1 / ATTACHMENT_1 , REGION_2 / ATTACHMENT_2
Replace the following values:
GROUP_NAME : the name of your attachment group
REGION_1 : the name of the region of the first VLAN attachment
ATTACHMENT_1 : the name of the first VLAN attachment that
you want to create within this attachment group
REGION_2 : the name of the region of the second VLAN attachment
ATTACHMENT_2 : the name of the second VLAN attachment that
you want to create within this attachment group
