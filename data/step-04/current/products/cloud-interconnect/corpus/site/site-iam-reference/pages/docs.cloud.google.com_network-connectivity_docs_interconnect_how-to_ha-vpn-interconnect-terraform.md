What's next?
You can use the following Terraform examples to deploy HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect.
The examples require that you already have two Dedicated Interconnect
connections provisioned in two edge availability domains (zones).
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see
Basic Terraform commands .
Examples
5-Gbps example 10-Gbps example
