This document describes learned routes, how the dynamic routing mode of a
Virtual Private Cloud network affects learned routes, and best path selection modes
available in Cloud Router.
Learned routes are either routes that Cloud Router receives from remote
peer routers using the BGP protocol or custom learned routes that you configure
on a Cloud Router:
BGP received routes
BGP routes learned from a remote peer. The peer router can be any of the
following:
A physical on-premises router
Another Cloud Router
A Router appliance VM (with Network Connectivity Center)
A router from a different cloud provider
Custom learned routes
Custom learned routes are manually configured on Cloud Router to
simulate routes learned from a remote peer. Custom learned routes are useful
when you don't have administrator control to configure a remote peer router.
Cloud Router enforces quotas for the number of unique prefixes for
dynamic routes, including the prefixes that are dynamically learned from a BGP
peer or are manually configured as custom learned routes. For more information,
see Cloud Router quotas .
Cloud Router doesn't re-advertise learned
routes unless you use an
NCC hybrid spoke with data transfer enabled.
Both types of Cloud Router learned routes are processed by a
dynamic route control plane and then a VPC network
control plane. The processing steps use destination prefix and route metrics
to create dynamic
routes in a VPC network.
For information about the differences between the dynamic route control plane
and the VPC network control plane, see How Cloud Router
works .
Custom learned routes
Custom learned routes provide the same advantages as BGP-received dynamic
routes. Unlike static routes , custom learned dynamic
routes are automatically withdrawn when the BGP session for a next hop goes
down.
Custom learned routes are the only way to define non-BGP routes for certain next
hops, like Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachments and
HA VPN tunnels.
For more information, see Specify and manage custom learned
routes .
Dynamic routing mode
The dynamic routing mode of a VPC network affects how received
BGP routes and custom learned routes are processed by the dynamic route control
plane and the VPC network control plane to create dynamic routes
in the VPC network.
When using VPC Network Peering, the dynamic routing mode of the
VPC network that exports custom routes controls how dynamic
routes are created in peer VPC networks that import custom
routes. For more information, see Effects of the dynamic routing
mode in the
VPC Network Peering documentation.
Google Cloud VPC networks support two dynamic routing
modes:
Regional dynamic routing mode
Each region's dynamic route control plane only processes learned routes from
the Cloud Router BGP tasks in its own region. The resulting dynamic
routes created in a particular region of a VPC network have
next hops only within that specific region.
Global dynamic routing mode
Each region's dynamic route control plane processes learned routes from the
Cloud Router BGP tasks in its own region. Each region's dynamic
route control plane also sends the best path for each prefix to the dynamic
route control planes in all other regions used in the VPC
network. The resulting dynamic routes created in a particular region of a
VPC network can have next hops in any region.
Best path selection modes
Cloud Router offers two modes for best path selection: standard and legacy.
The best path selection mode applies to all learned routes through
Cloud Router in all regions of a VPC network, including
custom learned routes.
Legacy is the default best path selection mode when a new VPC
network is created. We recommend that you use legacy mode unless you need
specific features of standard mode or use a Google Cloud feature that relies on
standard mode.
NCC for site-to-site data transfers and NCC for
third-party network virtual appliances or Router appliance works with either
standard best path selection or legacy best path selection.
NCC route exchange with VPC
spokes
has the following limitations for best path selection modes:
If a route is uniquely advertised by one VPC, both legacy
and standard modes work as expected.
If the same route is advertised by multiple VPCs to the same
workload VPC, then the following apply:
If all VPCs use legacy best path selection, then the
workload VPCs apply legacy best path selection across
routes from different routing VPCs.
If all VPCs use standard best path selection, then the
workload VPCs use the best route from one of the routing
VPCs based upon an internal algorithm.
If the routing VPCs use a mix of legacy best path
selection and standard best path selection, then the workload
VPCs use either the best route based on legacy best path
selection or one of the best standard best path selection routes based
on an internal algorithm.
If you plan on advertising the same route from multiple routing
VPCs, then we recommend that you select legacy best path
selection for all your VPC networks.
Legacy best path selection
This section describes how Cloud Router BGP tasks and the
dynamic route control plane implement the legacy best path selection mode.
AS path length
In legacy best path selection mode, AS path information is only relevant within
a single Cloud Router BGP task, and the dynamic route control plane
doesn't use the AS path information to make best path selection decisions. When
using legacy best path selection mode, don't rely on selecting the best path
based on AS-path length information when different Cloud Router
software tasks are involved for the same destination prefix.
BGP sessions involve multiple Cloud Router BGP tasks. For more
information, see Cloud Router BGP
tasks .
BGP task selection process
A Cloud Router BGP task receives destination prefixes from peer routers
of the BGP sessions that it manages. The BGP task creates a set of unique
destination prefixes from all of the BGP sessions that the BGP task manages.
Then the BGP task determines at least one best next hop for each of the
BGP-received unique destination prefixes using the following process:
Shortest AS path length : the BGP task sorts the list of next hops by AS
path length, from shortest AS path length to longest AS path length. After
sorting, the BGP task removes all next hops that don't
have the shortest AS path length from consideration.
Preferred origin type : the BGP task prefers next hops that use the
Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) over next hops that use the Exterior Gateway
Protocol (EGP), and the BGP task prefers next hops that use EGP over next
hops that have an Incomplete origin type.
If at least one next hop's origin type is IGP, then the BGP task removes
all next hops with EGP or Incomplete origin types from consideration.
If none of the next hops has an origin type IGP and if at least one next
hop's origin type is EGP, the BGP task removes all next
hops with Incomplete origin types from consideration.
Smallest MED value : The BGP task sorts next hops from smallest to
largest multi-exit discriminator (MED) value. After sorting, the BGP task
removes all next hops that don't have the smallest MED value from
consideration.
The BGP task sends each destination prefix and its corresponding list of best
next hops to the region's dynamic route control plane. In some cases the
Cloud Router BGP software task might also send next hops that have been
removed from consideration.
Dynamic route control plane processing
Each region's dynamic route control plane enforces the following quotas, which
apply to unique destinations from both BGP received and custom learned routes:
Unique Cloud Router dynamic route prefixes from own region per region
per VPC network
Unique Cloud Router dynamic route prefixes from other regions per region
per VPC
network
When enforcing the previous Cloud Router quotas, the dynamic route control
plane drops all route information associated with unique destinations that sort
beyond the limit for either Cloud Router quota. For more information, see
Deterministic route dropping behavior .
After enforcing the quotas, the dynamic route control plane applies the
following processing algorithm to each non-dropped unique destination prefix:
The dynamic route control plane creates a list of next hops for the
prefix. The list consists of:
Next hops and MED values for the prefix received from each
Cloud Router BGP task within the VPC network in
its own region.
Next hops and priority values for custom learned routes that use
the prefix. The priority of a custom learned route is treated like
a MED value.
The following steps occur only when the VPC network that
contains the Cloud Routers uses the global dynamic routing mode:
The dynamic route control plane sends only the next hops that
have the lowest MED value to the dynamic route control planes in
other regions. If more than one next hop has the same lowest MED value,
then they're all exported to the dynamic route control planes in other
regions. The information sent includes both the next hops and
the lowest MED value.
The dynamic route control plane receives a list of next hops and
MED values from dynamic route control planes in other regions. The
dynamic route control plane adds each next hop to its list of next hops
for the prefix. When adding each next hop, the dynamic route control
plane adjusts the MED value by adding an inter-regional cost.
The dynamic route control plane sorts its list of next hops for the prefix
from smallest to largest received MED value.
The dynamic route control plane truncates the list of routes that are sent
to the VPC control plane. Typically the list of routes
sent to the VPC control plane includes the routes with the
lowest MED values, and, if available, the next-to-lowest MED values.
However, the dynamic route control plane only guarantees that it sends the
routes with the lowest MED values to the VPC control plane.
Standard best path selection mode
The standard best path selection mode more closely adheres to RFC
4271 . It offers the following
benefits over the legacy best path selection mode:
Consistent AS path-based routing : AS path information is considered over
all of the routes learned on all of the Cloud Routers of the
VPC network. This lets you influence traffic flow using AS
path prepending.
Better flexibility and customization : you have more control over how BGP
prefixes are ranked within your VPC networks, including the
ability to fine-tune BGP best-path routing. Dynamic routes always have
a lower VPC network route priority compared to
static routes .
When using the standard best path selection mode, Cloud Router offers
the following configuration options:
Compare MED values : you can choose either of the following options:
Always compare: the MED value for each destination prefix is
compared without considering the AS that the Cloud Router
learned the prefix from.
Conditionally compare: prefixes are grouped by the AS that the
Cloud Router learned the prefix from. For each prefix within
each AS, the hops are ranked by the MED value matching described in RFC
4271 .
Add region to inter-region costs : you can select whether inter-region
costs are added to MED values.
BGP task selection process
A Cloud Router BGP task receives destination prefixes from peer routers
of the BGP sessions that it manages. The BGP task creates a set of unique
destination prefixes from all of the BGP sessions that the BGP task manages.
Then the BGP task determines at least one best next hop for each of the
BGP-received unique destination prefixes using the following process:
Shortest AS path length : the BGP task sorts the list of next hops by AS
path length, from shortest AS path length to longest AS path length. After
sorting, the BGP task removes all next hops that don't
have the shortest AS path length from consideration.
Preferred origin type : the BGP task prefers next hops that use the
Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) over next hops that use the Exterior Gateway
Protocol (EGP), and the BGP task prefers next hops that use EGP over next
hops that have an Incomplete origin type.
If at least one next hop's origin type is IGP, then the BGP task removes
all next hops with EGP or Incomplete origin types from consideration.
If none of the next hops has an origin type IGP and if at least one next
hop's origin type is EGP, the BGP task removes all next hops with Incomplete
origin types from consideration.
Consider neighbor ASN : the VPC network setting
routingConfig.bgpAlwaysCompareMed controls this step of the algorithm as
follows:
If routingConfig.bgpAlwaysCompareMed is True , the neighbor ASN value
of each next hop isn't considered relevant. The BGP task sorts next hops
from smallest to largest MED value. After sorting, the BGP task removes
all next hops that don't have the smallest MED value from consideration.
If routingConfig.bgpAlwaysCompareMed is False or isn't set, the
neighbor ASN value of each next hop is considered relevant, so the BGP
task does the following:
The BGP task groups the list of next hops by neighbor ASN value.
Within each neighbor ASN group, the BGP task sorts the next hops
from smallest to largest MED value. (The smallest-numbered MED value
might be different in each neighbor ASN group.)
Within each neighbor ASN group, the BGP task removes all next hops
that don't have the smallest MED value from consideration.
The BGP task sends each destination prefix and its corresponding list of
non-removed next hops to the region's dynamic route control plane. In some cases
the Cloud Router BGP software task might also send next hops that have
been removed from consideration.
Dynamic route control plane processing
Each region's dynamic route control plane enforces the following quotas, which
apply to unique destinations from both the BGP received and custom learned
routes:
Unique Cloud Router dynamic route prefixes from own region per region
per VPC network
Unique Cloud Router dynamic route prefixes from other regions per region
per VPC
network
When enforcing the previous Cloud Router quotas, the dynamic route control
plane drops all route information associated with unique destinations that sort
beyond the limit for either Cloud Router quota. For more information, see
Deterministic route dropping behavior .
After enforcing the quotas, the dynamic route control plane applies the
following processing algorithm to each non-dropped unique destination prefix:
Initial list of next hops for the prefix : the dynamic route control
plane creates an initial list of next hops for the prefix consisting of both
of the following:
The BGP-received next hop information from BGP tasks managing
Cloud Routers in the VPC network, located in the
same region as the dynamic route control plane.
The next hop information of custom learned routes for the prefix,
defined on Cloud Routers in the VPC network,
and located in the same region as the dynamic route control plane.
Custom learned routes have the following BGP attributes applied:
AS path, consisting of just the peer's ASN. That is an AS-path
length of 1, and the neighbor ASN of the peer's ASN.
Origin, set to Incomplete.
MED value, where each custom learned route priority is treated like
a MED value.
Inter-region cost set to 0.
Shortest AS path length : the
dynamic route control plane sorts the list of next hops by AS path length,
from shortest AS path length to longest AS path length. The dynamic route
control plane removes all next hops that don't have the shortest AS path
length from consideration.
Preferred origin type : the
dynamic route control plane prefers next hops that use IGP over next hops
that use the EGP, and next hops that use EGP over next hops that have an
Incomplete origin type.
If at least one next hop's origin type is IGP, then the dynamic route
control plane removes all next hops with EGP or
Incomplete origin types from consideration.
If none of the next hops has an origin type IGP and if at least one next
hop's origin type is EGP, the dynamic route control plane removes from
consideration all next hops with Incomplete origin types.
Consider neighbor ASN : the
VPC network setting routingConfig.bgpAlwaysCompareMed
controls this step of the algorithm as follows:
If routingConfig.bgpAlwaysCompareMed is True , then the neighbor ASN
value of each next hop isn't considered relevant. In this case, the
dynamic route control plane sorts next hops from smallest to largest MED
value. Next hops with the smallest MED have the highest rank . The
dynamic route control plane removes all next hops except for those with
the highest rank from consideration.
If routingConfig.bgpAlwaysCompareMed is False or isn't set, the
neighbor ASN value of each next hop is considered relevant, so the
dynamic route control plane does the following:
The dynamic route control plane groups the list of next hops by
neighbor ASN value.
Within each neighbor ASN group, the dynamic route control plane
sorts the next hops from smallest to largest MED value. The
smallest-numbered MED value might be different in each neighbor ASN
group.
Within each neighbor ASN group, the dynamic route control plane
removes all next hops that don't have the smallest MED value from
consideration.
The next hops that have the smallest MED values within each neighbor
ASN group have the highest rank . The dynamic route control plane
removes all next hops except for those with the highest rank from
consideration.
Send all highest-ranked next hops to other regions : when the dynamic
routing mode of the VPC network is global, the dynamic route
control plane sends the current set of highest-ranked next hops to other
regions.
Receive highest-ranked hops from other regions : when the dynamic routing
mode of the VPC network is global, the dynamic route control
plane receives a list of highest-ranked next hops for the prefix from the
dynamic route control planes in each of the other regions. Each received
next hop includes AS path length, neighbor ASN, origin type, and MED, plus
the region of the dynamic route control plane that sent the next hop.
The dynamic route control plane appends the received next hops to its list
of next hops for the prefix, then does the following:
Repeats the Shortest AS path length
step.
Repeats the Preferred origin type step.
Repeats the Consider neighbor ASN step
according to the routingConfig.bgpInterRegionCost setting of the
VPC network:
If routingConfig.bgpInterRegionCost of the VPC
network is ADD_COST_TO_MED , the dynamic route control plane uses
adjusted MED values when repeating the Consider neighbor
ASN step. Each adjusted MED value is the
sum of the original MED value plus an inter-regional cost. Next hops
in the dynamic route control plane's own region have an
inter-regional cost of 0 . Next hops learned from dynamic route
control planes in other regions have nonzero inter-regional costs,
unique to each region pair consisting of the sending region and
receiving region.
If the routingConfig.bgpInterRegionCost of the VPC
network is DEFAULT or not set, the dynamic route control plane
repeats the Consider neighbor ASN step
using original MED values.
Remove from consideration all next hops that don't have the smallest
inter-regional cost : when the dynamic routing mode of the
VPC network is global, the dynamic route control plane
removes from consideration all next hops except for the next hops that have
the smallest inter-regional cost.
Send next hops to the VPC control plane : For each unique destination
prefix, the dynamic route control plane sends all next hops with the highest
rank and smallest inter-regional cost to the VPC control
plane. These next hops create dynamic routes in the dynamic route control
plane's region of the VPC network. These dynamic routes have
Andromeda route priority 65536 . The 65536 priority number is
purposefully chosen because it's one value larger than 65535 , the lowest
priority of a static route . Consequently, if both
static and dynamic routes exist for the same destination prefix, a static
route is preferred by the routing order .
In some situations, the dynamic route control plane can send next hops that
have lower ranks or non-lowest inter-regional cost. These additional next
hops also create dynamic routes in the dynamic route control plane's region
of the VPC network, but they use lower Andromeda route
priorities—for example, 65537 , 65538 .
VPC control plane processing
Each region's VPC control plane receives candidate dynamic routes
from the region's dynamic route control plane. Unless a dynamic route is dropped
by the dynamic route control plane, the VPC control plane
evaluates each candidate dynamic route. Evaluation results in either creating a
dynamic route in the VPC network that contains the
Cloud Routers or suppression of the candidate dynamic route. The
following are reasons why a candidate dynamic route is suppressed:
The candidate dynamic route's destination prefix conflicts with a local,
peering, or NCC subnet route. For more information, see
Interactions with dynamic
routes .
The VPC control plane determines that the next hop for the
candidate dynamic route isn't usable before an updated BGP state is
processed by Cloud Router. For more information, see the Disregard
static and dynamic routes with unusable next
hops .
Each region's VPC control plane can also create peering dynamic
routes in peered VPC
networks, if the VPC network containing the
Cloud Routers exports custom routes and the peered VPC
network imports custom routes. For information about custom route exchange using
VPC Network Peering, see Options for exchanging dynamic
routes .
When creating peering dynamic routes, each region's VPC control
plane independently evaluates candidate dynamic routes on a per-network basis.
In addition to the previously noted suppression cases, the following additional
suppression cases apply in peered VPC networks:
If the destination prefix of a candidate peering dynamic route exactly
matches the destination prefix of a local dynamic route, the
VPC control plane suppresses the conflicting peering dynamic
route.
If candidate peering dynamic routes for the same destination prefix are
received from two or more peered VPC networks, the
VPC control plane uses an internal algorithm to pick the
network from which it imports peering dynamic routes. This internal
algorithm is evaluated before considering route priority. For more
information, see Select next hops for peering custom routes from a single
VPC
network .
If the dynamic routes per region per peering group
quota exceeds its limit, the
VPC control plane only suppresses peering dynamic routes.
Because each VPC control plane suppresses dynamic routes on a
per-network basis, keep the following in mind:
If a candidate dynamic route becomes a local dynamic route in the
VPC network that contains the Cloud Routers that
created the candidate dynamic route, the candidate dynamic route might be
suppressed in one or more peered VPC networks.
If a candidate dynamic route has been suppressed in the VPC
network that contains the Cloud Routers that created the candidate
dynamic route, the candidate dynamic route might become a peering dynamic
route in one or more peered VPC networks.
BGP state changes
BGP-received and custom learned routes produce dynamic routes as described in
Best path selection modes . Dynamic routes persist
for as long as the corresponding BGP session is established. Dynamic routes are
removed when a BGP session is considered down or has been terminated. The
following are common examples:
If the peer router supports graceful restart and sends a graceful restart
notification (TCP FIN or RST packet), Google Cloud removes the
dynamic routes learned from the BGP session after the peer
router's graceful restart timer has expired. For more information, see
graceful restart
timer .
If the peer router sends a BGP CEASE notification, Google Cloud
removes the dynamic routes learned from the BGP session
immediately. For more information, see Section 4.5 of RFC
4271 .
If neither of the previous notification situations apply, and the
negotiated hold timer is reached, Google Cloud removes the dynamic
routes learned from the BGP session. For more information, see
hold timer .
Planned maintenance events for
Cloud Interconnect
result in removal of dynamic routes whose next hops are the VLAN attachments
associated with a Cloud Interconnect connection during the
connection's maintenance. During planned maintenance, the corresponding
BGP sessions are taken down. To minimize disruptions, make sure that your
Cloud Interconnect VLAN attachments and connections adhere to one of the
following requirements:
99.99% availability for
Dedicated Interconnect
99.99% availability for
Partner Interconnect
99.9% availability for
Dedicated Interconnect
99.9% availability for
Partner Interconnect
