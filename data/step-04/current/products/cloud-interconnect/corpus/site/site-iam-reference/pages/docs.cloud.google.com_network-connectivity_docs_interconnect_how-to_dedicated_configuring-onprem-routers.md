This document describes how to configure on-premises routers for
Dedicated Interconnect. If you are creating a
Partner Interconnect connection, see
Configuring on-premises routers for Partner Interconnect .
After you create a VLAN attachment ,
you need to configure your on-premises router to establish a
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) session with your Cloud Router. To configure
your on-premises router, use the VLAN ID, interface addresses, and
peering addresses provided by the VLAN attachment.
If you create a dual-stack VLAN attachment, you can configure an IPv4 BGP
session, an IPv6 BGP session, or both. If you configure both an IPv4 BGP session
and an IPv6 BGP session, the BGP sessions run in parallel over the same VLAN
attachment. For more information about parallel BGP sessions, see Establish BGP
sessions in the
Cloud Router documentation.
You can also optionally configure your BGP
sessions to use
MD5 authentication .
If you added MD5 authentication to the BGP session on Cloud Router,
you must use the same authentication key when you configure BGP on your
on-premises router.
For definitions of terms used on this page, see
Cloud Interconnect key terms .
To help you solve common issues that you might encounter when using
Dedicated Interconnect, see
Troubleshooting .
Use sample topologies
This document provides the following sample topologies and configurations that
you can use as a guide when configuring your on-premises router:
Layer 3 only topology (recommended) : A Dedicated Interconnect
connection or connections terminating on an on-premises router. The
router performs BGP peering with Cloud Router.
Layer2/Layer3 topology : A Dedicated Interconnect
connection or connections terminating on an on-premises switch connected to an
on-premises router. The router performs BGP peering with Cloud Router.
For values for third-party platforms that you might use for your on-premises
router, see vendor-specific
notes .
For definite values, see your on-premises router documentation.
The sample topologies in this document use the following Google Cloud resources:
The project Sample Interconnect Project
The network my-network
The region us-east1
There are two Dedicated Interconnect connections,
my-interconnect1 and my-interconnect2 . These connections are already
provisioned and have a status of ready to use .
Layer 3 only topology
In this topology, the Dedicated Interconnect connections
terminate on an on-premises router, which performs BGP peering with
Cloud Router.
The following diagrams show both the physical and logical Layer 3 only topology.
Sample physical, on-premises Layer 3 only topology (click to enlarge)
Sample logical, on-premises Layer 3 only topology (click to enlarge)
Layer 2/Layer 3 topology
In this topology, the Dedicated Interconnect connections terminate
on an on-premises switch, which then connects to an on-premises router. The
router performs BGP peering with Cloud Router.
The following diagrams show the physical and logical Layer 2/Layer 3
topology.
Sample physical Layer 2/Layer 3 topology (click to enlarge)
Sample logical Layer 2/Layer 3 topology (click to enlarge)
Configure on-premises devices for testing
The following section describes how to configure on-premises devices for
testing your Dedicated Interconnect. For a
Layer 2/Layer 3 configuration, this
example describes configuring the test interface on one or more
Google Cloud-facing switches, but not on the routers.
For information about how to test, see Testing
connections .
For production configurations of on-premises devices that show all device
settings, see Configuring on-premises routers for production .
Before Google starts testing your new Dedicated Interconnect
connection, configure your interfaces without VLAN tagging, which is
sometimes referred to as access mode .
Sample configuration for testing
The following example shows how to configure a Juniper router before testing,
showing the required parameters to configure for port channel ae0 . This
configuration uses the following settings:
A BGP IPv4 address of 169.254.0.2 configured on port channel ae0 .
LACP configured on port channel ae0 .
VLAN tagging not configured on port channel ae0 . You must configure
your interfaces without VLAN tagging (access mode).
A 1460-byte maximum transmission unit (MTU). However, you can use a 1500- or
8896-byte MTU if you adjust the router interface configuration accordingly,
and if the MTU of the attachment and the MTU of the connected
VPC network are also set to 1500 or 8896 bytes.
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 description "my-interconnect2"
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 gigether-options 802.3ad ae0
set interfaces ae0 description "my-interconnect2"
set interfaces ae0 aggregated-ether-options lacp active
set interfaces ae0 aggregated-ether-options minimum-links 1
set interfaces ae0 unit 0 family inet mtu 1460
set interfaces ae0 unit 0 family inet address 169.254.0.2
After your Dedicated Interconnect connection is working, continue
to the next section to see a sample production configuration for each topology.
Configure on-premises routers for production
This section describes how to configure the Layer 3 only topology and the
Layer 2/Layer 3 topology for production use. Each sample configuration describes
all device settings.
For information about how to configure on-premises devices for testing your
Dedicated Interconnect connection, see
Configure on-premises routers for testing .
Production on-premises router settings for both topologies
Based on the configuration in the sample Google Cloud project, the following
table summarizes the on-premises router settings to use for the example topologies.
For the sample project name, VPC network, and region used on the
Google Cloud side, see the
topology reference .
The hold timer and keepalive timer values allow Google to quickly transfer traffic
to redundant connections in the event of an issue. Set their values as shown in
the table.
Graceful restart prevents BGP sessions from packet drops and route withdrawal
during Cloud Router maintenance. If your on-premises device supports
BGP graceful restart, enable it and set the graceful restart and stalepath timers
as shown in the table.
For more information about BGP timer settings, see the
recommended values for BGP timers
in the Cloud Router documentation.

Configure Layer 3 only topology for production
Use the following guidelines when configuring the Layer 3 only topology:
The on-premises router port (0/0 in the diagram) or ports facing
Cloud Router must be part of a port channel, even if there is only
one port.
The port channel must have LACP enabled in either active or passive mode.
LACP is required because it allows you to adjust the capacity of a
Dedicated Interconnect connection without disrupting traffic.
The maximum transmission unit of the router interface (0/0 in the diagram)
should be one of 1440, 1460, 1500, or 8896 bytes, depending on the MTU of the
attachment and the MTU of the connected VPC
network .
For EBGP multi-hop configuration, check the Dataplane version
of your VLAN attachment by using the
gcloud compute interconnects attachments describe command.
The command returns a dataplaneVersion field if the Dataplane
version is 2 or higher. If the command output does not contain a dataplaneVersion
field, the Dataplane version is 1 .
If your VLAN attachment uses Dataplane version 1, you must configure
multi-hop for the EBGP neighbor. The recommended value for this setting is 4 .
If your VLAN attachment uses Dataplane version 2 or higher,
you are not required to configure multi-hop for the EBGP neighbor.
Do not configure EBGP multi-hop if you plan to use
Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) in the BGP sessions of your VLAN
attachment, and if BFD multi-hop is inherited from your BGP multi-hop
configuration. Google Cloud supports only BFD single-hop mode.
See Configuring BFD .
Note: For Juniper, you might need to configure
aggregated-devices
for aggregated interfaces ( ae ) to function.

Configure Layer 2/Layer 3 topology for production
Use the following guidelines for your on-premises switch and routers when
configuring the Layer 2/Layer 3 topology:
VLANs must be configured on the switch.
The switch port (1/1 as shown in the diagram) or ports facing toward
Cloud Router must be part of a port channel.
The port channel must have LACP enabled, in either active or passive mode.
LACP is required because it allows you to adjust the capacity of a
Dedicated Interconnect connection without disrupting traffic.
The port channel must be configured in 802.1Q trunk mode, and all VLAN IDs
used by the Dedicated Interconnect connection must be allowed.
The port channel must have 802.1Q VLAN tagging enabled.
The switch port (1/2 as shown in the diagram) facing toward the on-premises
router can be a trunk port or an access port. This covers the case where a
router port is dedicated to a single VLAN.
When enabling trunk mode on the switch side, the on-premises router must
support subinterfaces with necessary encapsulation (dot1q tags).
This configuration uses a 1460-byte MTU. However, you can use a 1500- or
8896-byte MTU if you adjust the router interface configuration accordingly,
and if the MTU of the attachment and the MTU of the connected
VPC network are also 1500 or 8896 bytes.
For EBGP multi-hop configuration, check the Dataplane version
of your VLAN attachment by using the
gcloud compute interconnects attachments describe command.
The command returns a dataplaneVersion field if the Dataplane
version is 2 or higher. If the command output does not contain a dataplaneVersion
field, the Dataplane version is 1 .
If your VLAN attachment uses Dataplane version 1, you must configure
multi-hop for the EBGP neighbor. The recommended value for this setting is 4 .
If your VLAN attachment uses Dataplane version 2 or higher, you are not
required to configure multi-hop for the EBGP neighbor.
Do not configure EBGP multi-hop if you plan to use
Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) in the BGP sessions of your VLAN
attachment, and if BFD multi-hop is inherited from your BGP multi-hop
configuration. Google Cloud supports only BFD single-hop mode.
See Configuring BFD .
Note: For Juniper, you might need to configure
aggregated-devices
for aggregated interfaces ( ae ) to function.

Set up on-premises routers for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic
This section provides vendor-specific configuration examples that you can use
to set up your on-premises routers to exchange IPv4 and IPv6 traffic with
Cloud Interconnect and Cloud Router.
You can exchange IPv4 and IPv6 routes in your Dedicated Interconnect by doing
either of the following:
Create an IPv4 BGP session and an IPv6 BGP session for each of your dual-stack VLAN
attachments.
Create a single IPv4 or IPv6 BGP session for each VLAN attachment and enable multiprotocol
BGP (MP-BGP).
IPv6 BGP session support is in Preview .
Dual-stack VLAN attachments are not supported for Partner Interconnect or for
HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect deployments.
Before you begin
Before you configure your on-premises router for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, you need several
pieces of information from Cloud Router.
To obtain BGP session details from Cloud Router, run the
gcloud compute routers describe command
and specify the name of the Cloud Router used by your VLAN attachments.
gcloud compute routers describe ROUTER_NAME /
--project PROJECT_ID /
--region REGION
The output is similar to the following if you created both an IPv4 BGP session and an IPv6 BGP
session for each of your VLAN attachments.

Verify BGP connectivity
To verify BGP connectivity after you have configured your Juniper JunOS device, run the following
command.
show route protocol bgp
In the output, verify that your IPv4 and IPv6 networks are advertised over BGP.
Device configuration for multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) sessions
Use the following to configure your on-premises routers for IPv4 and IPv6 routing
using multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) over Dedicated Interconnect.
Cloud Router allows you to use MP-BGP in IPv4 or IPv6 BGP sessions. However, the
following instructions provide configuration examples only for IPv4 BGP sessions with MP-BGP.
These instructions do not provide configuration examples for IPv6 BGP sessions with MP-BGP.
If you use this configuration, IPv6 route exchange depends on the IPv4 BGP sessions. This setup
requires that you use routing policy configure IPv6 next hop addresses on your on-premises
router.
VLAN 1010 / VLAN 1020 router (Arista EOS) VLAN 1010 / VLAN 1020 router (Cisco) VLAN 1010 / VLAN 1020 router (Juniper)
More
The following procedure describes how to set up your Arista EOS router to support IPv4 and
IPv6 traffic on your VLAN attachments using MP-BGP.
Configure Arista EOS interfaces
Enable and configure the IPv6 addresses
on each BGP peer interface that is also configured with link-local addresses
for IPv4 BGP peering. To configure two interfaces, you run the following configuration commands:
interface Ethernet1.1010
encapsulation dot1q vlan 1010
ip address BGP_PEER_IPV4_ADDRESS_1 /29
ipv6 enable
ipv6 address BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1 /125
!
!
interface Ethernet2.1020
encapsulation dot1q vlan 1020
ip address BGP_PEER_IPV4_ADDRESS_2 /29
ipv6 enable
ipv6 address BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2 /125
Replace the following:
BGP_PEER_IPV4_ADDRESS_1 : the link-local IPv4 address of the
first BGP peer, which is configured as the first interface on your Arista EOS
device
BGP_PEER_IPV4_ADDRESS_2 : the link-local IPv4 address of the
second BGP peer, which is configured as the second interface on your Arista EOS
device
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the first BGP peer in Cloud Router
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the second BGP peer in Cloud Router
For example, your configuration might look like the following:
interface Ethernet1.1010
encapsulation dot1q vlan 1010
ip address 169.254.10.2/29
ipv6 enable
ipv6 address 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2d2/125
!
!
interface Ethernet2.1020
encapsulation dot1q vlan 1020
ip address 169.254.20.2/29
ipv6 enable
ipv6 address 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2da/125
Create route-maps
Next, create route-maps that change the next-hop for the IPv6 peer to the addresses
created in the previous step.
route-map IPv6-NextHop-1 permit 10
set ipv6 next-hop BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1
!
route-map IPv6-NextHop-2 permit 10
set ipv6 next-hop BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2
Replace the following:
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the first BGP peer in Cloud Router
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the second BGP peer in Cloud Router
For example, your configuration might look like the following:
route-map IPv6-NextHop-1 permit 10
set ipv6 next-hop 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2d2
!
route-map IPv6-NextHop-2 permit 10
set ipv6 next-hop 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2da
Create BGP for the IPv6 address family
Next, configure BGP for IPv6 address family, and specify the IPv6 networks that you want to
advertise.
When you configure the neighbors for the IPv4 peers, you configure the route-map
to change the next-hop to the interfaces specified in the previous step.

neighbor BGP_IPV4_ADDRESS_2 route-map IPv6-NextHop-2 out
network YOUR_IPV6_NETWORK
Replace the following:
ASN : the ASN for the Arista side of the BGP session
CLOUD_ROUTER_ASN : the ASN for the Cloud Router side of the BGP session
BGP_IPV4_ADDRESS_1 : the IPv4 link local address, or ipAddress ,
of the Cloud Router interface of the first BGP peer
BGP_IPV4_ADDRESS_2 : the IPv4 link local address, or ipAddress ,
of the Cloud Router interface of the second BGP peer
YOUR_IPV6_NETWORK : The on-premises IPv6 network that you want to advertise
For example, your configuration might look like the following:
router bgp 65201
maximum-paths 8
neighbor 169.254.10.1 remote-as 65200
neighbor 169.254.20.1 remote-as 65200
!

neighbor 169.254.10.1 activate
neighbor 169.254.20.1 activate
!
address-family ipv6
neighbor 169.254.10.1 activate
neighbor 169.254.10.1 route-map IPv6-NextHop-1 out
neighbor 169.254.20.1 activate
neighbor 169.254.20.1 route-map IPv6-NextHop-2 out
network 2001:db8::/32
Enable IP routing and IPv6 routing
Make sure that IP routing and IPv6 routing is enabled:
ip routing
!
ipv6 unicast-routing
Verify status
After you have configured both IP and IPv6 routing, you can verify BGP status on your
with Arista EOS device with the following command:
show ipv6 route
The following procedure describes how to set up your Cisco IOS and IOS-XE routers to
support IPv4 and IPv6 traffic on your VLAN attachments using MP-BGP.
Configure Cisco interfaces
Configure the IPv6 addresses on each BGP peer interface that is also configured with link-local
addresses for IPv4 BGP peering. Then enable IPv6.
To configure two interfaces, you supply the following configuration commands:
interface Po2.1010
no shutdown
encapsulation dot1Q 1010
ip address BGP_PEER_IPV4_ADDRESS_1 255.255.255.248
ipv6 address BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1 /125
ipv6 enable
!
interface Po3.1020
no shutdown
encapsulation dot1Q 1020
ip address BGP_PEER_IPV4_ADDRESS_2 255.255.255.248
ipv6 address BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2 /125
ipv6 enable
Replace the following:
BGP_PEER_IPV4_ADDRESS_1 : the link-local IPv4 address of the
first BGP peer, or peerIpAddress , which is configured as the first interface on your
Cisco device
BGP_PEER_IPV4_ADDRESS_2 : the link-local IPv4 address of the
second BGP peer, or peerIpAddress , which is configured as the second interface on your
Cisco device
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the first BGP peer in Cloud Router
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the second BGP peer in Cloud Router
For example, your configuration might look like the following:
interface Po2.1010
no shutdown
encapsulation dot1Q 1010
ip address 169.254.10.2 255.255.255.248
ipv6 address 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2d2/125
ipv6 enable
!
interface Po3.1020
no shutdown
encapsulation dot1Q 1020
ip address 169.254.20.2 255.255.255.248
ipv6 address 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2da/125
ipv6 enable
Create route-maps
Next, create route-maps that change the next-hop for the IPv6 peer to the addresses
created in the previous step.
route-map IPv6-NextHop-1 permit 10
set ipv6 next-hop BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1
!
route-map IPv6-NextHop-2 permit 10
set ipv6 next-hop BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2
Replace the following:
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the first BGP peer in Cloud Router
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the second BGP peer in Cloud Router
For example, your configuration might look like the following:
route-map IPv6-NextHop-1 permit 10
set ipv6 next-hop 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2d2
!
route-map IPv6-NextHop-2 permit 10
set ipv6 next-hop 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2dA
Create BGP for the IPv6 address family
Next, configure BGP for IPv6 address family, and specify the networks you want to
advertise.
The neighbor configuration for the IPv4 peers have the route-map configured
to change the next-hop to the interfaces specified in the previous step.
router bgp ASN
bgp log-neighbor-changes
neighbor BGP_IPV4_ADDRESS_1 remote-as CLOUD_ROUTER_ASN
neighbor BGP_IPV4_ADDRESS_2 remote-as CLOUD_ROUTER_ASN

maximum-paths eibgp 8
network YOUR_IPV6_NETWORK
neighbor BGP_IPV4_ADDRESS_1 activate
neighbor BGP_IPV4_ADDRESS_1 route-map IPv6-NextHop-1 out
neighbor BGP_IPV4_ADDRESS_2 activate
neighbor BGP_IPV4_ADDRESS_2 route-map IPv6-NextHop-2 out
exit-address-family
Replace the following:
ASN : the ASN for the Cisco side of the BGP session
CLOUD_ROUTER_ASN : the ASN for the Cloud Router side of the BGP session
retrieved from peerIpv6NexthopAddress for the first BGP peer
BGP_IPV4_ADDRESS_1 : the IPv4 link local address, or ipAddress ,
of the Cloud Router interface of the first BGP peer
BGP_IPV4_ADDRESS_2 : the IPv4 link local address, or ipAddress ,
of the Cloud Router interface of the second BGP peer
YOUR_IPV6_NETWORK : The on-premises IPv6 network that you want to advertise
For example, your configuration might look like the following:
router bgp 64500
bgp log-neighbor-changes
neighbor 169.254.10.1 remote-as 65200
neighbor 169.254.20.1 remote-as 65200
!
...
!
address-family ipv6
maximum-paths eibgp 8
network 2001:db8::/32
neighbor 169.254.10.1 activate
neighbor 169.254.10.1 route-map IPv6-NextHop-1 out
neighbor 169.254.20.1 activate
neighbor 169.254.20.1 route-map IPv6-NextHop-2 out
exit-address-family
Verify status
After you have completed the configuration, you can verify BGP status with the
following commands:
show ipv6 route
show ip route
The following sections describe how to configure IPv4 and IPv6 (dual-stack)
traffic on your Juniper JunOS router for your Dedicated Interconnect
connection using MP-BGP.
Configure Juniper JunOS interfaces
Configure the IPv6 addresses on each BGP peer interface that is also configured with link-local
addresses for IPv4 BGP peering.
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 vlan-tagging
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 unit 0 vlan-id 1010
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address BGP_PEER_IPV4_ADDRESS_1 /29

set interfaces xe-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet6 address BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2 /125
Replace the following:
BGP_PEER_IPV4_ADDRESS_1 : the link-local IPv4 address of the
first BGP peer, or peerIpAddress , which is configured as the first interface on your
Juniper device
BGP_PEER_IPV4_ADDRESS_2 : the link-local IPv4 address of the
second BGP peer, or peerIpAddress , which is configured as the second interface on your
Cisco device
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the first BGP peer in Cloud Router
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the second BGP peer in Cloud Router
For example, your configuration might look like the following:
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 vlan-tagging
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 unit 0 vlan-id 1010
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 169.254.10.2/29

set interfaces xe-0/0/1 unit 0 vlan-id 1020
set interfaces xe-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet address 169.254.20.2/29
set interfaces xe-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet6 address 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2da/125
Configuration block example:
interfaces {
xe-0/0/0 {
vlan-tagging;
unit 0 {
vlan-id 1010;
family inet {
address 169.254.10.2/29;
}
family inet6 {
address 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2d2/125;
}
}
}
xe-0/0/1 {
vlan-tagging;
unit 0 {

family inet {
address 169.254.20.2/29;
}
family inet6 {
address 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2da/125;
}
}
}
}
Create policy statements
Next, create policy statements that change the next-hop for the IPv6 peer
to the addresses created above:
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 from family inet6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 from prefix-list ipv6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 then next-hop BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 then accept
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 from family inet6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 from prefix-list ipv6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 then next-hop BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 then accept
Replace the following:
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_1 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the first BGP peer in Cloud Router
BGP_PEER_IPV6_NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS_2 : the IPv6 next hop address,
or peerIpv6NexthopAddress , assigned to the second BGP peer in Cloud Router
For example, your configuration might look like the following:
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 from family inet6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 from prefix-list ipv6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 then next-hop 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2d2
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 term 1 then accept
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 from family inet6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 from prefix-list ipv6
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 then next-hop 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2da
set policy-options policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 term 1 then accept
Configuration block example:
policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-1 {
term 1 {
from {
family inet6;
}
then {
next-hop 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2d2;
accept;
}
}
}
policy-statement set-v6-next-hop-2 {

from {
family inet6;
}
then {
next-hop 2600:2d00:0:1:8000:12:0:2da;
accept;
}
}
}
Configure BGP for IPv6 route exchange
Next, configure BGP for IPv6 and set the "include-mp-next-hop" statement
to send the next-hop attribute to the peer.
Configure the export statement to the policy statement created above
to change the next-hop to the IPv6 address specified.

Verify BGP connectivity
To verify BGP connectivity after you have configured your Juniper JunOS device,
run the following command.
show route protocol bgp
In the output, verify that your IPv6 networks are being advertised over BGP.
Best practices
Follow these best practices to ensure effective connectivity to Google Cloud
from your on-premises devices when using Cloud Interconnect 99.9% and
99.99% topologies.
Configuring devices for active/active forwarding
Ensure that the same MED values are exchanged across all BGP sessions.
Enable
equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing
in your BGP configuration.
Enable graceful restart on your BGP sessions to minimize the impact of Cloud Router task
restarts. When you connect two attachments through different edge availability domains, as
described in the recommended topologies, the Cloud Router uses one task per edge availability
domain. To avoid downtime,
software tasks are
scheduled independently.
If you are configuring two on-premises devices, use any routing protocol to connect both
devices to each other. If you are configuring your device to use redistribution, use either
IBGP or IGP.
Configuring devices for active/passive forwarding
To avoid asymmetric routing, make sure that higher MED values are applied on the
Cloud Router side and on the on-premises device side.
Enable graceful restart on your BGP sessions to minimize the impact of Cloud Router task
restarts. When you connect two attachments through different edge availability domains, as
described in the recommended topologies, the Cloud Router uses one task per edge availability
domain. To avoid downtime,
software tasks are
scheduled independently.
If you are configuring two on-premises devices, make sure that both devices
have Layer 3 connectivity to each other. If you are configuring your device
to use redistribution, use either IBGP or IGP.
Verifying BGP sessions
Check that your BGP sessions are working between your on-premises network and
your Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. For more information, see
Viewing Cloud Router status and routes
in the Cloud Router documentation.
