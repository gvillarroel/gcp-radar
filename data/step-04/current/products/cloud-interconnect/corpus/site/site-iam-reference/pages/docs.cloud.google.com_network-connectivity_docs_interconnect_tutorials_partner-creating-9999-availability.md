Establish 99.99% availability for Partner Interconnect
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
In this tutorial, you use Partner Interconnect to create and
configure resources to achieve 99.99%
availability . Google
recommends this configuration for production-level applications, such as
mission-critical operations that have a low tolerance for downtime.
For Cloud Interconnect terminology used on this page, see
Key terms .
For information about redundant Partner Interconnect connections
that have sufficient capacity in a failover scenario, see
Best practices .
Note: Before you begin, you must have an existing connection with a supported
service provider .
Requirements
The following resources and settings are required to achieve 99.99%
availability:
At least four VLAN attachments, two per
Google Cloud region . Even if you only have
virtual machine (VM) instances in a single region, you must use two regions.
If a region-wide issue occurs, Google Cloud can reroute traffic
through the other region to your VMs. Each pair of VLAN attachments must
have its own Cloud Router (two different Cloud Routers).
When Cloud Router is connected to VLAN attachments in different
edge availability
domains ,
Google Cloud uses two software
tasks
for redundancy. Even though only two Cloud Routers are required,
topologies with four Cloud Routers, one for each VLAN attachment,
also meet the SLA requirement.
The VLAN attachments in one region must connect to a
Partner Interconnect connection in one metropolitan area
(metro), and attachments in the other region must connect to a connection in
another metro.
The Google Cloud console automatically assigns a
Partner Interconnect connection and a different edge
availability domain (metro availability zone) to each attachment when you
configure a redundant pair of attachments.
Important: If you use the API, you must manually assign each attachment to a
different connection and to a different edge availability domain. This is
because maintenance windows aren't coordinated across different metros, but
they are coordinated for different edge availability domains within the same
metro.
For more information about choosing a Partner Interconnect
connection location, see
Requesting connections .
Make sure that your Cloud Router advertises the same
prefixes on all links, possibly with different priorities.
The dynamic routing mode for the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network must be
global. With global dynamic routing, Cloud Router can advertise all
subnets and propagate learned routes to all subnets regardless of the
subnet's region.
Depending on your hardware and availability requirements, you might have one
or more routers in your on-premises network.
Example topology
This example topology uses the following resource names, regions, and
connection locations. As you walk through the tutorial, replace these values
with your own.
Region
Router name
VLAN attachment name
Connection location
Edge availability domain
us-central1
router-central1
attach-central-a
Dallas

us-central1
router-central1
attach-central-b

us-east4
router-east4
attach-east-a
Ashburn
1
us-east4
router-east4
attach-east-b
Ashburn
2
The following diagram shows four layer 2 connections in two different
metros. Within each metro, each connection is in a different edge availability
domain: Dallas - domain 1 , Dallas - domain 2 , Ashburn - domain 1 , and
Ashburn - domain 2 .
The Cloud Routers (one for each region) are in
the vpc1 network in the us-central1 and us-east4 regions. For layer 2
connections, users configure Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) sessions on their
on-premises routers to each of their Cloud Routers.

Similar to the layer 2 topology, the following layer 3 topology shows four
Partner Interconnect connections in two different metros and in
different edge availability domains. The Cloud Routers (one for each
region) are in the vpc1 network in the us-central1 and us-east4 regions.
For layer 3 connections, the service provider configures the BGP sessions.
Redundant connections for 99.99% availability using layer 3 (click to enlarge)
Configure the preferred path
For 99.99% availability, you must set the dynamic routing mode of your
VPC networks to global. With global dynamic routing,
Cloud Router advertises routes to all subnets in the VPC
network. Cloud Router advertises routes to remote subnets
(subnets outside of the Cloud Router's region) with a lower
priority compared to local subnets (subnets that are in the
Cloud Router's region). For more information, see Dynamic routing
mode
in the Cloud Router documentation.
In the example topology, ingress traffic to the VPC network
prefers to go through the us-central1 region because those routes have a
higher priority compared to routes from the us-east4 region. Traffic traverses
through us-east4 only if the connections in us-central1 fail.
You can change route priorities when you configure a Cloud Router's BGP
session. The BGP session has an option for an advertised route priority (a MED
value). A lower value means a higher priority. You can, for example, configure
the BGP sessions in us-east4 with a higher priority, making that region the
preferred path. For more information, see
Advertised prefixes and priorities
in the Cloud Router documentation.
Create a 99.99% topology
The following sections walk through the steps for creating this topology. To
create a topology that's tailored for you, replace the sample input values with
your own. For example, replace the vpc1 network name with your
VPC network name.
Create the VPC network
For the vpc1 network, create a network with custom subnets and set its dynamic
routing mode to global. For more information, see
Creating a custom mode network
in the VPC documentation.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPC networks page.
Go to VPC networks
Click Create VPC network .
For Name , enter vpc1 .
For Subnet creation mode , select Custom .
Specify the details of your subnet:
Name : Enter subnet-uscentral1 .
Region : Select us-central1 .
IP address range : Specify an IP range, such as
192.168.1.0/24 . Use a range that doesn't overlap with your
on-premises network.
Click Add subnet .
Specify the details of your second subnet:
Name : Enter subnet-useast4 .
Region : Select us-east4 .
IP address range : Specify an IP range, such as
192.168.2.0/24 . Use a range that doesn't overlap with your
on-premises network.
In the Dynamic routing mode section, select Global .
Click Create .
gcloud
Create a custom subnet:
gcloud compute networks create vpc1 \
--subnet-mode custom \
--bgp-routing-mode global
Specify the subnet prefixes for the us-central1 and us-east4 regions:
gcloud compute networks subnets create subnet-uscentral1 \
--network vpc1 \
--region us-central1 \
--range 192.168.1.0/24
gcloud compute networks subnets create subnet-useast4 \
--network vpc1 \
--region us-east4 \
--range 192.168.2.0/24
Create Cloud Routers
Create two Cloud Routers, one in each region. For
Partner Interconnect, all Cloud Routers must have a
local ASN of 16550 .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Create a
Cloud Router page.
Go to Create a Cloud Router
Specify the Cloud Router details:
Name : Enter router-central1 for the name of the first
Cloud Router.
Network : Select vpc1 , which is the name of the
network where the on-premises network extends to.
Region : Select us-central1 , which is the region where
the Cloud Router is configured, as shown in the example
topology.
Google ASN : Enter 16550 , which is required for
Partner Interconnect.
Under Routes , select Advertise all subnets visible to the
Cloud Router (default) , and then click Create .
Create another Cloud Router with the same attributes in the
us-east4 region with the name router-east4 .
gcloud
Create a Cloud Router in the vpc1 network in the
us-central1 region; use ASN 16550 :
gcloud compute routers create router-central1 \
--asn 16550 \
--network vpc1 \
--region us-central1
Create a Cloud Router in the vpc1 network in the us-east4
region; use ASN 16550 :
gcloud compute routers create router-east4 \
--asn 16550 \
--network vpc1 \
--region us-east4
Create VLAN attachments
Create four VLAN attachments and pair them with Cloud Routers, as shown
in the following list:
router-central1 is associated with attach-central-a and
attach-central-b
router-east4 is associated with attach-east-a and attach-east-b
Note: For layer 3 connections, you can
pre-activate your VLAN
attachments so that you don't have to come back to Google Cloud and
activate them after your service provider has configured them. For this
tutorial, the VLAN attachments aren't pre-activated because pre-activation skips
a verification step when working with Partner Interconnect VLAN
attachments.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Interconnect Hybrid
Connectivity page.
Go to Interconnect Hybrid Connectivity
Click Get started .
Select Partner Interconnect , and then click Continue .
Select I already have a service provider .
Select Create a redundant pair of VLAN attachments (recommended) .
For the Network and Region fields, select the vpc1 network and
the us-central1 region, which specifies the VPC network
and region to connect to.
Specify the details of the first VLAN attachment (VLAN A):
Cloud Router : Select router-central1 .
VLAN attachment name : Enter attach-central-a . This name is
displayed in the Google Cloud console and is used by the
Google Cloud CLI to reference the attachment.
Specify the details of the second VLAN attachment (VLAN B):
Cloud Router : Select router-central1 .
VLAN attachment name : Enter attach-central-b .
Click Create to create the attachments, which takes a few moments to
complete.
Click OK to view a list of your VLAN attachments.
Repeat these steps to create another redundant pair of
attachments for the us-east4 region.
gcloud
Create four attachments:
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner create attach-central-a \
--router router-central1 \
--region us-central1 \
--edge-availability-domain availability-domain-1
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner create attach-central-b \
--router router-central1 \
--region us-central1 \
--edge-availability-domain availability-domain-2
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner create attach-east-a \
--router router-east4 \
--region us-east4 \
--edge-availability-domain availability-domain-1
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner create attach-east-b \
--router router-east4 \
--region us-east4 \
--edge-availability-domain availability-domain-2
Retrieve pairing keys
After you create your VLAN attachments, Google Cloud generates pairing
keys for each one. Pairing keys enable service providers to identify your VLAN
attachment without you having to share information about your project or
resource names.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VLAN attachments tab.
Go to VLAN attachments
Find the attach-central-a VLAN attachment, and then click View
instructions .
The Google Cloud console shows the pairing key for the attachment.
Copy and record the key; you'll share these keys with your service
provider when you request a connection with them.
Click OK to return to the list of VLAN attachments.
Retrieve the pairing keys for the attach-central-b , attach-east-a ,
and attach-east-b VLAN attachments.
gcloud
Retrieve the VLAN attachment pairing keys by describing each one; use
these keys to request connections with your service provider:
gcloud compute interconnects attachments describe attach-central-a \
--region us-central1
The previous command outputs the following information:
adminEnabled: false
edgeAvailabilityDomain: AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN_1

selfLink: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/customer-project/regions/us-central1/interconnectAttachments/attach-central-a
state: PENDING_PARTNER
type: PARTNER
Record the value of the pairingKey for each VLAN attachment.
Request connections from your service provider
Contact your service provider and request four connections, one for each VLAN
attachment. The service provider requires the pairing key, capacity, and
location for each attachment.
Attachments from one Google Cloud region must connect to a single location
(city). In this example, attach-central-a and attach-central-b are connected
to Dallas, and attach-east-a and attach-east-b are connected to Ashburn.
After the connection configuration is complete, you receive an email notification
indicating that you can activate your attachments.
Activate VLAN attachments
After your service provider configures your VLAN attachments, you must activate
them before they can start passing traffic. If you pre-activated your
attachments, you can skip this step.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VLAN attachments tab.
Go to VLAN attachments
Select the attach-central-a VLAN attachment to view its details page.
If the status of your attachment is Waiting for service provider , wait
until your service provider has completed the VLAN configuration.
Review the Interconnect information to check that the expected
service provider configured the VLAN attachment.
Click Activate to activate the attachment.
Go back to the VLAN attachments tab and activate the other
attachments.
gcloud
Describe each VLAN attachment to verify whether your service provider
completed configuring them:
gcloud compute interconnects attachments describe attach-central-a \
--region us-central1 \
--format '(name,state,partnerMetadata)'
gcloud compute interconnects attachments describe attach-central-b \
--region us-central1 \
--format '(name,state,partnerMetadata)'
gcloud compute interconnects attachments describe attach-east-a \
--region us-east4 \
--format '(name,state,partnerMetadata)'
gcloud compute interconnects attachments describe attach-east-b \
--region us-east4 \
--format '(name,state,partnerMetadata)'
After your service provider configures your VLAN attachments, the state
of your attachments changes from PENDING_PARTNER to PENDING_CUSTOMER .
If the state is still PENDING_PARTNER , wait until your service
provider has completed the VLAN configuration.
Check the partnerMetadata field to verify that the correct service
provider configured each VLAN attachment.
If an unexpected third party configured your VLAN attachment, delete
the attachment and then create a new one, which generates a new pairing
key. Use the new pairing key to request another connection with your
service provider.
If the correct service provider has configured your VLAN attachments,
activate them by using the --admin-enabled flag:
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update attach-central-a \
--region us-central1 \
--admin-enabled
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update attach-central-b \
--region us-central1 \
--admin-enabled
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update attach-east-a \
--region us-east4 \
--admin-enabled
gcloud compute interconnects attachments partner update attach-east-b \
--region us-east4 \
--admin-enabled
Configure routers
Google automatically adds a BGP peer on each Cloud Router. For layer 2
connections, you must add your on-premises ASN to each BGP peer. For
layer 3 connections, you don't need to do anything; Google automatically
configures your Cloud Routers with your service provider's ASN.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VLAN attachments tab.
Go to VLAN attachments
Select the attach-central-a VLAN attachment to view its details page.
Click Configure BGP to configure the Cloud Router that's
associated with this VLAN attachment.
In the Peer ASN field, add the ASN of your on-premises router.
Click Save and continue .
Go back to the VLAN attachments tab and add your on-premises ASN
to the other Cloud Router.
gcloud
Describe the Cloud Router that's associated with the
attach-central-a VLAN attachment. In the output, find the name of the
automatically created BGP peer that's associated with your VLAN
attachment. The values of ipAddress and peerIpAddress of the BGP peer
must match the values of cloudRouterIpAddress and
customerRouterIpAddress of your attachment.

After the BGP sessions are established, you can pass between your
VPC network and on-premises network through your service
provider's network.
