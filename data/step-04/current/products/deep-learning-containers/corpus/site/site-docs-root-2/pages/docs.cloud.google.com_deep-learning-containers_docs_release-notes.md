Feature
M128 release
Except for TensorFlow container images, new container images don't include conda. This change was made to improve size, performance, and vulnerability management. The existing container image names now point to container images that don't include conda (for example: gcr.io/deeplearning-platform-release/base-cpu.py310 ).
Container images that include conda will be available until at least September 30, 2025. These container images now have -conda appended to the name (for example: gcr.io/deeplearning-platform-release/base-cpu-conda.py310 ).
All TensorFlow container images still include conda, but M128 container image names have -conda appended. Specifying container images without -conda appended references older container images, which also include conda.
