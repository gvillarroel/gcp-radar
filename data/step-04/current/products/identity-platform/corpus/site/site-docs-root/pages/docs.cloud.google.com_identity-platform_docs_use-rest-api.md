Using the REST API
This document shows you how to perform common user operations, such as signing
in users and working with tokens, using the Identity Platform REST API.
Before you begin
To use the REST API, you'll need an Identity Platform API key. To obtain a key:
Go to the Identity Providers page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the Identity Providers page
Click Application setup details .
Copy the apiKey field.
Note that HTTPS is required for all API calls.
Calling the API
Exchange custom token for an ID and refresh token
You can exchange a custom Auth token for an ID and refresh token by issuing an HTTP
POST request to the signInWithCustomToken endpoint.
Method: POST
Content-Type: application/json
Endpoint
https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:signInWithCustomToken?key =[ API_KEY ]
Request Body Payload
Property Name
Type
Description
token
string
An Identity Platform custom token from which to create an ID and refresh token pair.
returnSecureToken
boolean
Whether or not to return an ID and refresh token. Should always be true.
tenantId
string
The tenant ID the user is signing into. Only used in multi-tenancy. Must match the tenant_id in the token.
Custom Token Claims
Property
Name
Description
alg
Algorithm
Should be RS256 .
iss
Issuer
Your project's service account email address.
sub
Subject
Your project's service account email address.
aud
Audience
https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/google.identity.identitytoolkit.v1.IdentityToolkit
iat
Issued-at time
The current time, in seconds since the UNIX epoch.
exp
Expiration time
The time, in seconds since the UNIX epoch, at which the token expires. It
can be a maximum of 3600 seconds later than the iat .
Note: this only controls the time when the custom token itself
expires. But once you sign a user in using
signInWithCustomToken() , they will remain signed in into the
device until their session is invalidated or the user signs out.
uid
User Id
The unique identifier of the user, between 1-36 characters long.
tenant_id
Tenant Id
The identifier of the tenant that the user is signing in to.
claims (optional)
Optional custom claims to include in the Security Rules auth or request.auth variables.
Response Payload
Property Name
Type
Description
idToken
string
An Identity Platform ID token generated from the provided custom token.
refreshToken
string
An Identity Platform refresh token generated from the provided custom token.
expiresIn
string
The number of seconds in which the ID token expires.
Sample request
curl 'https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:signInWithCustomToken?key=[API_KEY]' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-binary '{"token":"[CUSTOM_TOKEN]","returnSecureToken":true}'
In the example above, you would replace
[API_KEY] with the Web API Key of your Identity Platform project,
[CUSTOM_TOKEN] with the generated custom Auth token.
A successful request is indicated by a 200 OK HTTP
status code. The response contains the Identity Platform ID token and refresh token associated
with the custom token.
Sample response
{
"idToken" : "[ID_TOKEN]" ,
"refreshToken" : "[REFRESH_TOKEN]" ,
"expiresIn" : "3600"
}
Common error codes
INVALID_CUSTOM_TOKEN: The custom token format is incorrect or the token is invalid for
some reason (e.g. expired, invalid signature etc.)
CREDENTIAL_MISMATCH: The custom token corresponds to a different Google Cloud project.
Exchange a refresh token for an ID token
You can refresh an Identity Platform ID token by issuing an HTTP
POST request to the securetoken.googleapis.com endpoint.
Note: By default, Google validates the project number of your refresh token to ensure it matches that of
your API key. If the project number doesn't match, you will receive the PROJECT_NUMBER_MISMATCH
error code. This validation mitigates the potential risk of abusers collecting your API
keys to generate refresh tokens for their own projects. If you understand the risk and want to opt out of this behavior, you can submit an
exemption request by filing a Google Cloud support case .
