Feature
Media CDN no longer requires a HEAD request before fetching objects from
your origin. This enhancement streamlines content delivery, reduces overhead,
and improves overall performance. See origin requirements .

Feature
Media CDN supports multipart range requests, which enable users to request
multiple non-contiguous segments of a file in a single HTTP request.
This feature is Generally Available .
For more information, see Multipart range requests .

Feature
Media CDN supports flexible shielding. You can specify a single
geographic region for origin shielding. This way, cache fills route through
this configured region, offering a more efficient configuration for centralized
origins than the default user-location-based approach.
