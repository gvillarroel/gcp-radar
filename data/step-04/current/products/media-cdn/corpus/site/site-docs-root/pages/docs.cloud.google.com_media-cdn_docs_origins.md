Origins overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Media CDN lets you fetch content from your origin
infrastructure, whether content is hosted within Google Cloud, in another
cloud, or on-premises.
Each configuration can have one or more origins associated with it. Origin
configurations tell Media CDN how to connect to your
infrastructure, when and how to fail over, retry, and time out, and what
protocol to use when connecting.
Origins have the following features:
Origins can be defined per host and per route, which allows a single
EdgeCacheService resource to map to multiple origins
that contain, for example, manifests, video segments, and other static
content.
Origins can be reached over HTTP/2, HTTPS, and unencrypted HTTP/1.1.
You can configure firewall rules to allow only specific Google IP
addresses so that only Media CDN can access your origins.
Retries and failover behaviors are configured per origin, and can allow
the service to fail over on hard errors (such as connectivity failure) or
retry based on HTTP 404 Not Found or HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
responses. These operations are performed only for the safer HTTP methods,
including GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS . For more information about safe HTTP
methods, refer to RFC 9110 .
Private resources inside Google Cloud or on-premises can be reached
by configuring an external Application Load Balancer as an
origin behind
Media CDN.
Redirect-following behavior is configured per origin. You can enable
Media CDN to follow redirects to other origin servers.
Origin requirements
To allow Media CDN to cache origin responses larger than
1 MiB, an origin must include the following in the response headers for
GET requests, unless specified otherwise:
A Last-Modified or ETag HTTP response header (a validator ).
A valid HTTP Date header.
A valid Content-Length header.
The Content-Range response header, in response to a Range GET request.
The Content-Range header must have a valid value in the form of bytes
x-y/z (where z is the object size).
The default origin protocol is HTTP/2. If your origins only support HTTP/1.1,
you can set the protocol field explicitly for each origin.
Note: Small responses (less than 1 MiB) that lack the full set of headers
listed previously might be evicted from cache more quickly than larger
responses.
Origin shielding
Media CDN provides a deeply tiered edge infrastructure
that is designed to actively minimize cache fill wherever possible.
There are three primary layers of caching infrastructure:
Deep edge caches, which serve the majority of traffic and off-load within
a service providers network.
Google's peering edge, which is connected to thousands of ISPs and acts as
the mid-tier cache for edge caches, and for cases where those are not
present within a given ISP, the user-facing cache.
Long-tail caches within Google's network that other downstream caches fill
from prior to the origin. These caches support significant fan-in, have
substantial cache storage capacity, and act as an origin shield .
An overview of this topology is shown here:
Topology overview (click to enlarge).
Media CDN provides origin shielding by default using a limited
set of key, global locations. The default origin shielding operates based on
the location of the end user and not of the origin. This works well and
provides strong offload benefits when end-users and origin servers are in the
same region and when global origin servers are located in multiple regions.
Flexible shielding
Important: Flexible shielding is an advanced configuration. Choosing an
inappropriate shielding region can negatively impact performance, potentially
increasing latency compared to the default behavior. Default origin shielding
is highly recommended unless your primary use case involves a centralized
origin serving content to widely distributed global end users.
In scenarios where your origin is centralized in one region but your users are
globally distributed, the default origin shielding behavior, which is based on
user location, might be suboptimal in the following ways:
Increase latency for cache misses when the default shield location is
geographically distant from your centralized origin
Reduced origin offload by scattering cache-fill requests across multiple
global default shield locations instead of concentrating them
Flexible shielding helps you overcome these limitations by configuring a
single, specific geographic region for origin shielding ,
typically selected to be near your centralized origin. Flexible shielding then
routes all cache fill requests through shield caches located in or near the
configured region. This consolidates load to your origin through those
regionally-focused caches.
By configuring a flexible shielding region in the same geographical region as
your centralized origin, you can optimize the following:
Cache hit rate at the shield layer
Origin offload
Latency for cache misses and uncacheable content
Performance stability
Flexible shielding is compatible with any origin type configured in
Media CDN.
Request collapsing
Request collapsing actively collapses multiple user-driven
cache fill requests for the same cache key into a single origin request, per
edge node.
All layers of caching support request collapsing (or coalescing ) to further
reduce origin load. Based on observed, real-world workloads at scale:
> 95% of cache fill uses a dedicated long-tail cache node within
the region, in order to reduce cache fill costs and latency.
Cache fill between the origin and Google's own edge infrastructure is
entirely over Google's global private backbone network, which reduces cache
fill latency and improves reliability—both are active benefits for
live streaming workloads.
Caches cross-fill from each other where advantageous to do so, further
driving down cache fill rates.
Media CDN has significant storage capacity across
caches, which minimizes the eviction rates even for long-tail, less popular
content.
Customers might see different offload rates depending on their cache
configuration, user load, workloads (such as live versus on-demand), user
distribution, and how much long-tail content (total corpus size) they serve to
users across regions.
Combined with origin shielding , request collapsing further
reduces origin load and egress bandwidth needs, and is the default behavior for
Media CDN.
Collapsed requests have both the client-facing request logged and the
(collapsed) cache fill request logged. The leader of the collapsed session is
used to make the origin fill request, which means that the origin sees the
headers (including the User-Agent) of only that client.
Requests that don't share the same cache key cannot be collapsed.
Origin connectivity
The following sections describe how Media CDN connects to origins, how
HTTP requests are made, and how you can authenticate requests.
Supported origins and protocols
Media CDN directly supports any publicly reachable HTTP endpoint
as an origin, including the following:
Cloud Storage buckets, including private buckets through
Identity and Access Management service accounts
External Application Load Balancers
Amazon S3-compatible buckets, including
private buckets that use
AWS Signature Version 4
Other publicly available object storage, such as Azure Blob Storage
Publicly available web servers, such as public VMs or on-premises hosts
Connectivity to origins is over secure tunnels and Google's global backbone
network.
The following table details the supported origin protocols.
Protocol
Supported
SSL (TLS) required
HTTP/2
Yes (default)
Yes
HTTPS (HTTP/1.1 over TLS)
Yes
Yes
HTTP/1.1
Yes
No
Media CDN uses HTTP/2 (h2) to connect to an origin by default.
HTTP/2 and HTTPS both require a valid, publicly trusted TLS (SSL) certificate.
A valid certificate is one that is unexpired, signed by a public Certificate
Authority, and has a Subject Alternative Name matching the hostname sent to the
origin .
Notes:
If your origin doesn't support HTTP/2, you can explicitly set the protocol
(on a per-origin basis) to HTTP (HTTP/1.1) or HTTPS (HTTP/1.1 over TLS).
When configuring HTTPS or HTTP/1.1 as the origin protocol,
Media CDN doesn't negotiate an alternative protocol (such
as HTTP/2). Similarly, when configuring HTTP/2, the connection doesn't
fall back to HTTP/1.1, in order to be explicit about origin connectivity
behavior.
Media CDN automatically uses the correct port based on the
protocol: port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS and HTTP/2.
Origin request headers
When connecting to an origin, Media CDN uses the Host header
from the client request by default.
The following table documents what the origin sees in the incoming request under
different configuration scenarios:
Client Request
EdgeCacheService.hostRewrite
EdgeCacheOrigin.hostRewrite
originAddress
Host header /
TLS SNI at origin
media.example.com
None
None
backend.example.com
media.example.com
media.example.com
service.example.com
None
backend.example.com

backend.example.com
origin.example.com
media.example.com
service.example.com
origin.example.com
gs://vod-content-bucket
set automatically based on the bucket name
The primary origin and any failover origins see the same host header if they
share the same routeRule or hostRewrite configuration.
Any hostRewrite settings are ignored when using a Cloud Storage
bucket as the origin because alternative host header values are not supported
by Cloud Storage buckets. The host header is automatically set based on
the bucket name.
The TLS SNI (Server Name Indication) value in the request (for HTTP/3, HTTP/2,
and HTTPS requests) is set to the same value as the host header sent to the
origin.
For information about rewriting host headers for per-route configuration, see
Configure service routes . For information about
setting per-origin override actions, see Origin failover without redirect
following .
Allow the origin to receive traffic from Media CDN
To reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your content, use an IP allowlist
at the origin to block access to all IP addresses except the specific IP address
ranges that Google uses to send requests to external origins. That way, only
Media CDN can connect to your origin servers.
The following table summarizes the required source IP address ranges for
firewall rules:
IP address type
Request source IP range
IPv4
136.124.4.0/22
IPv6
2001:4860:4864:a::/64
Note: These IP address ranges might change. For uninterrupted and secure
communication with your origins, check the Media CDN
release notes
frequently, and when required, update the Google Cloud IP address ranges in your
firewall configurations.
Use the following URL to access the JSON file that contains the updated
Google-assigned IP address ranges.

Failover and timeouts
The following sections describe these configuration options:
Timeouts: Determine how long Media CDN waits to connect
to your origin or for it to respond to a request.
Retries: Determine whether Media CDN retries an origin HTTP
request to your origin, and under what conditions.
Failover: Determine whether Media CDN attempts to connect
to a failover origin if the first is unavailable or returns a specific
status code.
Note: Retry or failover attempts are made only for GET , HEAD , and
OPTIONS requests.
Origin timeouts
Timeouts let you configure when origin retry and failover behaviors are
triggered and when subsequent client failover can be triggered.
The following describes the configurable timeouts that Media CDN
supports:
connectTimeout and maxAttemptsTimeout limit how long Media CDN
takes to find a usable response.
Both timeouts include the time that the origin takes to return headers and to
determine whether to use a failover or redirect. connectTimeout applies
independently for each origin attempt, while maxAttemptsTimeout includes
the time required to connect across all origin attempts, including
failovers and redirects. Following a redirect counts as an additional
attempt to connect to the origin, and counts toward the maxAttempts set
for the configured origin.
When Media CDN encounters a nonredirect response, such as
from a redirect or failover origin, the readTimeout and responseTimeout
values apply. Redirected origins use the connectTimeout , readTimeout ,
and responseTimeout values configured for the EdgeCacheOrigin that
encountered the redirect.
responseTimeout and readTimeout control how long a streamed response can
take. After Media CDN determines that it's going to use an
upstream response, neither connectTimeout nor maxAttemptsTimeout
matter. At this point, readTimeout and responseTimeout come into effect.
Media CDN makes at most four origin attempts across all origins,
regardless of the maxAttempts set by each EdgeCacheOrigin .
Media CDN uses the maxAttemptsTimeout value from the primary
EdgeCacheOrigin . The per-attempt timeout values ( connectTimeout ,
readTimeout , and responseTimeout ) are configured for the EdgeCacheOrigin
of each attempt.
The following table describes the timeout fields:
Field
Default
Description
connectTimeout
5 seconds
The maximum amount of time Media CDN can take from
starting the request to the origin until Media CDN determines
whether the response is usable. Practically, connectTimeout
covers the time starting with creating the request, then doing DNS
lookups, then doing TLS handshakes, TCP/QUIC connection establishment,
through getting the response headers
that contain the HTTP status code.
The timeout must be a value between 1 second and
15 seconds.
maxAttemptsTimeout
15 seconds
The maximum time across all connection attempts to the origin,
including failover origins, before returning an error to the client.
An HTTP 504 status code is
returned if the timeout is reached before a response is returned.
The timeout must be a value between 1 second and
30 seconds.
This setting defines the total duration for all origin
connection attempts, including failover origins, in order to cap the
total time clients have to wait for content to start streaming. Only the first
maxAttemptsTimeout value is used, where the first
is defined by the origin configured for the given route.
readTimeout
15 seconds
The maximum duration to wait between reads of a single HTTP response.
The readTimeout is capped by the responseTimeout .
All reads of the HTTP response must be completed by the deadline set by the
responseTimeout . The timeout must be a value between 1 second and
30 seconds. If this timeout is reached before the response is complete, the
response is truncated and logged.
responseTimeout
30 seconds
The maximum duration to allow for a response to complete.
The timeout must be a value between 1 second and
120 seconds.
The duration is measured from the time that the first body bytes are
received. If this timeout is reached before the response is complete, the
response is truncated and logged.
Consider the following examples:
Origin A matches requests to "/segments/" and has a
maxAttemptsTimeout value of 5s , a maxAttempts value of 1 , and a
failover_origin value of Origin B . The connectTimeout value is at its
default of 5s . If you attempt to connect to Origin A , and it fails
within 1 second due to an invalid TLS certificate, you have ~4 seconds left
to make a successful connection to Origin B .
Origin C matches requests to "/manifests/*, has a maxAttemptsTimeout
value of 10s , a maxAttempts value of 3 , and failover_origin not
configured. The connectTimeout value is at its default of 5s .
Media CDN attempts to connect to Origin C up to three
times, allowing up to 10 seconds (the maxAttemptsTimeout limit) to make a
successful connection.
Retry origin requests
Media CDN supports origin retries, allowing unsuccessful
requests to the origin to be retried. You can specify how many times the
current origin can be retried against before a failover origin (if configured)
is attempted.
Media CDN retries only the requests that use safe HTTP
methods, GET , HEAD , or OPTIONS .
Note: If a request using an unsafe method fails on the first attempt to the
primary origin, Media CDN responds to the client
with an HTTP 502 Bad Gateway status code. It doesn't attempt any retries
to another origin.
Media CDN attempts to reach the primary origin up to the
configured maxAttempts value, which defaults to 1 .
Media CDN retries origin connections up to a maximum of three
times before failing and returning an HTTP 502 Bad Gateway error to the
user. This includes any failover origin connections, which count towards
the limit of three.
When configuring an origin resource, you can configure a primary origin by
using the originAddress field, and then an optional failoverOrigin . The
failoverOrigin points at another origin resource.
The retryConditions for each origin specifies what types of failures
triggers a retry:
Condition
Default
Description
CONNECT_FAILURE
✔️
Retry on failures include routing, DNS and TLS handshake errors, and
TCP/UDP timeouts.
HTTP_5XX
Retry on any HTTP 5 xx status code.
GATEWAY_ERROR
Similar to 5 xx , but applies only to status codes
502 , 503 , or 504 .
RETRIABLE_4XX
Retry for 4 xx status codes that can be retried,
including 409 and 429 .
NOT_FOUND
Retry on an HTTP 404 status code.
FORBIDDEN
Retry on an HTTP 403 status code.
If you require active health-checking, round-robin, or load-aware steering
across origins, you can
configure an external Application Load Balancer
as the primary origin.
Failover behavior
Failover attempts are made only for the requests that use safer HTTP methods,
GET , HEAD , or OPTIONS .
Note: If a request using an unsafe method fails on the first attempt to the
primary origin, Media CDN responds to the client with an
HTTP 502 Bad Gateway status code. It doesn't attempt failover to another
origin.
The following table describes how failover operates, and what response a client
would observe:
Scenario
Failover configured
User-facing status
Media CDN attempts to connect to your origin, and
receives no HTTP response after two attempts (default).
No
HTTP 502 Bad Gateway
Media CDN attempts to connect to your primary origin,
and fails to connect (TLS handshake error). An attempt is made against
your configured failover origin, which returns an HTTP 404
error.
Yes
HTTP 404 Not Found
Media CDN attempts to connect to both your primary and
failover origin, but receives no HTTP status code.
Yes
HTTP 502 Bad Gateway
If Media CDN receives a status code matching any configured
retryConditions , such as an HTTP 404 Not Found or HTTP 429 Too Many
Requests error, and subsequent retry and failover origin requests continue to
fail, an HTTP 502 Bad Gateway error is returned to the client after origin
attempts are exhausted.
Best practices for origin failover
When configuring multiple origins for failover or load balancing, verify that
your media content and Vary , ETag , and Last-Modified header behaviors are
consistent between your origins.
Warning: Configuring redirects from an untrusted or an attacker-controlled
origin service might expose your Media CDN configuration to open
redirect vulnerabilities.
As a best practice, configure origin redirection only for origins that you trust
and control. Ensure that you trust every origin in a redirect chain because
each origin produces content that is served by your EdgeCacheService .
