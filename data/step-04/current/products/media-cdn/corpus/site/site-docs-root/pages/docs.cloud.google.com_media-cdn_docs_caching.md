Configure caching behavior
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Media CDN serves content as close to users as possible by
using Google's global edge caching infrastructure to cache content and
reduce load on origin infrastructure.
You can control how content is cached for each route. This lets you
optimize behavior based on the type of content, client request
attributes, and your freshness requirements.
Cacheability
The following sections describe what responses Media CDN caches
and how to improve cache offload.
Default caching behavior
By default, the following cache-related settings apply to each Edge Cache
service:
Default cache mode of CACHE_ALL_STATIC :
Respects origin cache directives, such as Cache-Control or Expires ,
up to a configurable max TTL.
Caches static media types automatically with a
default TTL of 3600s, if no origin cache directives are present.
Caches HTTP 200, 204, and 206 status codes (negative caching is not
enabled).
Does not cache responses that have no-store or private cache-control
directives or that are otherwise uncacheable .
Responses that are not static content or that are missing valid cache directives
are not cached unless caching is explicitly configured. To learn how to override
the default behavior, see the documentation on cache modes .
The default behavior is equivalent to the following cdnPolicy . Routes without
an explicit cdnPolicy configured behave as if they have the following
configuration:
cdnPolicy :
cacheMode : CACHE_ALL_STATIC
defaultTtl : 3600s
cacheKeyPolicy :
includeProtocol : false
excludeHost : false
excludeQueryString : false
signedRequestMode : DISABLED
negativeCaching : false
Cacheable responses
A cacheable response is an HTTP response that Media CDN can store
and quickly retrieve, thus allowing for faster load times. Not all HTTP
responses are cacheable.
You can configure cache modes for each route to override this
behavior (for example, using the CACHE_ALL_STATIC cache mode to cache common
media types) even if the origin does not set a
cache control directive in the response.
Requests and responses that meet the criteria defined in
uncacheable responses supersedes cacheability.
The following table describes the requirements to cache particular HTTP
responses. Both GET and HEAD responses must adhere to these requirements.
HTTP attribute
Requirements
Status code
The response status code must be one of 200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301,
302, 307, 308, 400, 403, 404, 405, 410, 451, 500, 501, 502, 503, or
504.
HTTP methods
GET and HEAD
Request headers
Most caching request directives are ignored. For more information, see
Cache control directives .
Response headers
Contains a valid HTTP caching
directive such as Cache-Control:
max-age=3600, public .
Has a cache mode that caches that content, or has an
Expires header with a date in the future.
Response size
Up to 100 GiB.
The HTTP Age header is set
based on when Media CDN first cached the response, and
typically represents the seconds since the object was cached at an
origin shielding location. If
your origin generates an Age response header, use the FORCE_CACHE_ALL
cache mode to prevent revalidations when Age exceeds the cache TTL.
For more information about how Media CDN interprets HTTP caching
directives, see Cache control directives .
Origin requirements
To allow Media CDN to cache origin responses larger than
1 MiB, an origin must include the following in the response headers for
GET requests, unless specified otherwise:
A Last-Modified or ETag HTTP response header (a validator ).
A valid HTTP Date header.
A valid Content-Length header.
The Content-Range response header, in response to a Range GET request.
The Content-Range header must have a valid value in the form of bytes
x-y/z (where z is the object size).
The default origin protocol is HTTP/2. If your origins only support HTTP/1.1,
you can set the protocol field explicitly for each origin.
Note: Small responses (less than 1 MiB) that lack the full set of headers
listed previously might be evicted from cache more quickly than larger
responses.
Uncacheable responses
The following table details the request and response attributes that prevent
a response from being cached. Responses that are cacheable but that match
"uncacheable" criteria aren't cached.
HTTP attribute
Requirement
Status code
A status code other than those defined as cacheable, such as HTTP 401,
HTTP 412, or HTTP 505.
These status codes are typically representative of client-facing issues
and not origin status. Caching those responses can lead to "cache
poisoning" scenarios where a user-triggered "bad" response is cached for
all users.
Request headers
For requests with an Authorization request
header, responses must include a public Cache-Control
directive to be cached.
A no-store directive in the request causes the
response not to be cached. For more information, see
Cache control directives .
Response headers
Has a Set-Cookie header.
Has a Vary header other than Accept ,
Accept-Encoding , Origin ,
X-Origin , X-Goog-Allowed-Resources ,
Sec-Fetch-Dest , Sec-Fetch-Mode , or
Sec-Fetch-Site .
In CACHE_ALL_STATIC or
USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS mode, has a no-store
or private cache control directive.
Response size
Greater than 100 GiB.
These rules apply in addition to the configured cache mode .
Specifically:
With the CACHE_ALL_STATIC cache mode configured, only responses
that are considered static content or responses with
valid cache directives in their response
headers are cached. Other responses are proxied as is.
The FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode caches all responses
unconditionally, subject to the uncacheability requirements stated
earlier.
The USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS cache mode requires responses to set
valid cache directives in their response headers in
addition to being a cacheable status code.
Notes:
Responses that are not cached don't have their cache control
directives or other headers changed and are proxied as is.
Responses can have their Cache-Control and Expires headers collapsed
into a single Cache-Control field. For example, a response with
Cache-Control: public and Cache-Control: max-age=100 on separate lines
would be collapsed as Cache-Control: public,max-age=100 .
Uncacheable responses (responses that would never be cached) are not counted
as Cache Egress from a billing perspective.
Using cache modes
Cache modes allow you to configure when Media CDN should respect
origin cache directives, cache static media types, and cache all responses
from the origin, regardless of the directives set.
Cache modes are configured at the route-level and, combined with TTL overrides,
allow you to configure cache behavior by host, path, query parameters, and
headers (any matchable request parameters).
By default, Media CDN uses the CACHE_ALL_STATIC cache
mode, which automatically caches common static media types for 1 hour
(3600 seconds), while prioritizing any cache directives specified by
the origin for cacheable responses .
You can increase or decrease the cache TTL applied to responses without an
explicit cache TTL set (a max-age or s-maxage directive) by setting the
cdnPolicy.defaultTtl field on a route.
To prevent caching non-success responses for longer than intended, non-2xx
(non-success) status codes are not cached according to their
Content-Type (MIME type) and don't have the default TTL applied.
Note: To configure how non-2xx responses such as redirects (3xx) are cached,
see Negative caching .
The available cache modes, which are set on the cdnPolicy.cacheMode of each
route, are shown in the following table.
Cache mode
Behavior
USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS
Requires origin responses to set valid cache directives and valid caching
headers. For a full list of requirements, see
Cacheable responses .
CACHE_ALL_STATIC
Automatically caches successful responses with static content,
unless they have a no-store or private
directive.
Valid caching directives from the origin are prioritized.
Static content includes video, audio, images, and common web assets as
defined by the MIME type in the Content-Type response
header.
FORCE_CACHE_ALL
Unconditionally caches successful responses, overriding any cache
directives set by the origin.
Make sure not to serve private, per-user content (such as dynamic HTML
or API responses) with this mode configured.
BYPASS_CACHE
Any request that matches a route with this cache mode configured bypasses
the cache, even if there is a cached object that matches that cache key.
We recommend using this only for debugging because Media CDN
is designed as a planet-scale cache infrastructure and not a general purpose
proxy.
Static content MIME types
The CACHE_ALL_STATIC cache mode allows Media CDN to
automatically cache common static content such as video, audio, images, and
common web assets based on the MIME type returned in the Content-Type HTTP
response header. However, regardless of media type, Media CDN
prioritizes any explicit Cache-Control or Expires headers in the origin
response.
The following table lists the MIME types that can be cached automatically
with the CACHE_ALL_STATIC cache mode.
Responses are not automatically cached if they don't have a Content-Type
response header with a value that matches the following values. You must ensure
that the response sets a valid cache directive , or
you must use the FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode to unconditionally cache
responses.
Category
MIME types
Web assets
text/css text/ecmascript text/javascript application/javascript
Fonts
Any Content-Type matching font/*
Images
Any Content-Type matching image/*
Videos
Any Content-Type matching video/*
Audio
Any Content-Type matching audio/*
Formatted document types
application/pdf and application/postscript
Note the following:
Your origin's web server software must set the Content-Type for
each response. Many web servers automatically set the
Content-Type header, including NGINX, Varnish, and Apache.
Cloud Storage sets the Content-Type header
automatically on upload when you use
the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI to upload content.
Cloud Storage always provides a Cache-Control header to
Media CDN. If no value is explicitly chosen, it sends a
default value. As a result, all successful Cloud Storage responses
are cached according to Cloud Storage default values, unless you
explicitly adjust the cache control metadata
for objects in Cloud Storage or use FORCE_CACHE_ALL mode to
override the values sent by Cloud Storage.
If a response is cacheable based on its MIME type but has a
Cache-Control response directive of private or
no-store or a Set-Cookie header, it isn't cached.
Other media types, such as HTML ( text/html ) and JSON
( application/json ), are not cached by default. These types of responses are
typically dynamic (per user), and are also not well suited for
Media CDN's architecture. We recommend using
Cloud CDN for serving web assets and for caching API
responses.
Configure cache TTLs
Time to live (TTL) overrides let you set default TTL values for cached content
and override TTL values set in the max-age and s-maxage cache control
directives (or Expires headers) set by your origins.
TTLs, whether set by overrides or by using a cache directive, are
optimistic. Content that is rarely accessed or unpopular might be evicted from
the cache prior to the TTL being reached.
The following table shows three TTL settings.
Setting
Default
Minimum
Maximum
Description
Applicable cache modes
Default TTL
1 hour (3600 seconds)
0 seconds
1 year (31,536,000 seconds)
The TTL to set when the origin has not specified a max-age or
an s-maxage header.
If the origin specifies an s-maxage header, it is used instead
of the default TTL value here.
When using FORCE_CACHE_ALL to unconditionally cache all
responses, the default TTL is used to set the cache TTL. All other values
and directives are ignored.
CACHE_ALL_STATIC
FORCE_CACHE_ALL
Max TTL
1 day (86400 seconds)
0 seconds
1 year (31,536,000 seconds)
For cacheable responses, the maximum TTL to allow. Values greater than
this are capped at the value of maxTtl .
CACHE_ALL_STATIC
Client TTL
Not set by default.
0 seconds
1 day (86400 seconds)
For cacheable responses, the maximum TTL to allow in the downstream
(client-facing) response if this needs to be different from other TTL
values.
CACHE_ALL_STATIC
FORCE_CACHE_ALL
Setting any TTL value to zero (0 seconds) causes every request to be revalidated
with the origin before a response is served and increases load to the origin if
set too broadly.
When the cache mode is set to Use Origin Headers , TTL settings cannot be
configured because Media CDN relies on the origin to drive
behavior.
Notes:
The value for max TTL must always be greater than (or equal to) the value of
default TTL.
The value for client TTL must always be smaller than (or equal to) the value
of max TTL.
When Media CDN overrides an origin TTL value, the
Cache-Control header to the client also reflects that value.
If the origin sets an Expires header and Media CDN
overrides the effective TTL (based on the timestamp), the Expires header
is replaced with a Cache-Control header in the downstream response to the
client.
Negative caching
Negative caching defines how non-success HTTP status codes (those other than
2xx) are cached by Media CDN.
This lets you cache error responses such as redirects (HTTP 301 and 308)
and not found (HTTP 404) responses closer to users, as well as reduce origin
load more broadly if the response is unlikely to change and can be cached.
Note: To configure how success responses (2xx status codes) are cached, see
cache modes .
By default, negative caching is disabled. The following table shows the default
values for each status code when negative caching is enabled and
negativeCachingPolicy isn't used.
Status codes
Reason-phrase
TTL
HTTP 300
Multiple Choices
10 minutes
HTTP 301 and HTTP 308
Permanent Redirect
10 minutes
HTTP 404
Not Found
120 seconds
HTTP 405
Method Not Found
60 seconds
HTTP 410
Gone
120 seconds
HTTP 451
Unavailable for Legal Reasons
120 seconds
HTTP 501
Not Implemented
60 seconds
The default set of negative caching codes matches the heuristically cacheable
status codes described in
HTTP RFC 9110 ,
with the following exceptions:
HTTP code 414 (URI Too Long) is not supported for caching, to avoid cache
poisoning.
HTTP code 451 (Unavailable for Legal Reasons) is supported for caching, as
described in
HTTP RFC 7725 .
If you need to configure your own per-status code TTLs, and override the default
behavior, you can configure a cdnPolicy.negativeCachingPolicy . This lets you
set the TTL for any of the status codes allowed by Media CDN:
300, 301, 302, 307, 308, 400, 403, 404, 405, 410, 451, 500, 501, 502, 503, and
504.
For example, to set a short, 5-second TTL for HTTP 404 (Not Found) responses,
and a 10-second TTL for HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed) responses, use the
following YAML definition on each applicable route:
cdnPolicy :
negativeCaching : true
negativeCachingPolicy :
"404" : 5s
"405" : 10s
# other status codes to apply TTLs for
Important: When you configure a negativeCachingPolicy , specify all of the
status codes (and their TTLs) that you want to cache. The default TTLs
(described on this page) don't apply when a policy exists.
To prevent cache poisoning, we don't recommend enabling caching for either
status code 400 (Bad Request) or 403 (Forbidden). Ensure that your origin server
returns either code as a result of examining only the components of the request
that are included in the cache key. Cache poisoning can occur, for example, when
the origin server responds with a 403 error response in the absence of a correct
Authorization header. In this case, caching the 403 error response results in
Media CDN serving the 403 error response to all subsequent
requests until the TTL expires, even if the requests have a correct
Authorization header.
To disable negative caching:
To disable the default negative caching behavior , set
cdnPolicy.negativeCaching: false on a route. Note that origin responses
with valid cache directives and cacheable status
codes are still cached.
To prevent negative caching for a specific status code, but still respect
origin cache directives , omit the status code
( cdnPolicy.negativeCachingPolicy[].code ) in your negativeCachingPolicy
definition.
To explicitly ignore the origin cache directives for a specific status
code , set cdnPolicy.negativeCachingPolicy[].ttl to 0 (zero) for that
status code.
Notes:
When negativeCaching is enabled on a route, and a response defines
valid cache directives , the cache directives in the
response take precedence.
If you configure an explicit negativeCachingPolicy , and there is a TTL
defined for the given status code, the TTL defined in the policy is always
used.
The maximum value for a TTL set by negativeCachingPolicy is 1800 seconds
(30 minutes), but origin cache directives with a higher TTL are respected.
If the cache mode is configured as FORCE_CACHE_ALL , origin
directives are ignored in all cases.
Cache control directives
Media CDN's behavior with respect to
Cache-Control directives
is defined here.
If the directive is not applicable to a request or response, such as
only-if-cached (a client-only directive), then "N/A" is marked in that column.
Directive
Request
Response
no-cache
The no-cache request directive is ignored to prevent clients from
potentially initiating or forcing revalidation to the origin.
A response with no-cache is cached, but requires
validation with the origin before it can be served.
This can be overridden on a per-route basis with the
FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode.
no-store
The response to a request with no-store isn't cached.
A response with no-store isn't cached.
This can be overridden on a per-route basis with the
FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode.
public
N/A
A response with the public directive is cached if the
response is considered cacheable as a whole and the response
has a max-age or an s-maxage directive as
well.
When using the CACHE_ALL_STATIC cache or
FORCE_CACHE_ALL modes, this is not required.
private
N/A
A response with the private directive isn't cached by
Media CDN, even if the response is otherwise considered
cacheable. Clients (such as browsers) might still cache the result.
This can be overridden on a per-route basis with the
FORCE_CACHE_ALL cache mode.
Use no-store to prevent all caching of responses.
max-age= SECONDS
The max-age request directive is ignored. A cached response is
returned as if this header was not included in the request.
A response with the max-age directive is cached up to
the defined SECONDS .
s-maxage= SECONDS
N/A
A response with the s-maxage directive is cached up to
the defined SECONDS .
If both max-age and s-maxage are present,
s-maxage is used by the server.
Note that s-max-age (two hyphens) is not valid for
the purposes of caching.
min-fresh= SECONDS
The min-fresh request directive is ignored. A cached response
is returned as if this header was not included in the request.
N/A
max-stale= SECONDS
The max-stale request directive is ignored.
A cached response is returned as if this header was not included in
the request.
N/A
stale-while-revalidate= SECONDS
N/A
No effect. This is passed on to the client in the response.
stale-if-error= SECONDS
The stale-if-error request directive is ignored. A cached
response is returned as if this header was not included in the request.
No effect. This is passed on to the client in the response.
must-revalidate
N/A
A response with must-revalidate is revalidated with
the origin server after it's expired.
proxy-revalidate
N/A
A response with proxy-revalidate is revalidated with the origin
server after it's expired.
immutable
N/A
No effect. This is passed on to the client in the response.
no-transform
N/A
No transforms are applied by Media CDN.
only-if-cached
The only-if-cached request directive is ignored. A cached
response is returned as if this header was not included in the request.
N/A
Where possible, Media CDN is RFC-compliant (HTTP
RFC 7234 ), but favors
optimizing for cache offload and minimizing the impact that clients can have on
hit rate and overall origin load.
For responses that use the HTTP/1.1 Expires header:
The value of the Expires header must be a valid HTTP-date as
defined in RFC 7231
A date value in the past, an invalid date, or a value of 0 indicates that
the content has already expired and requires revalidation.
Media CDN ignores the Expires header if a Cache-Control
header is present in the response.
The HTTP/1.0 Pragma header, if present in a response, is ignored and passed
through as-is to the client.
Cache keys
You can reduce the number of times Media CDN needs to contact your
origin by considering what uniquely identifies a request, and removing
components that might often change between requests. The set of request
components are often referred to as a 'cache key'.
The following sections describe how to configure cache keys.
Cache key components
A cache key is the set of request parameters (such as the host, path, and query
parameters) that a cached object is referenced by.
By default, cache keys for Edge Cache services include the request host, path
and query parameters from the request, and are scoped to a specific
EdgeCacheService.
Component
Included by default?
Details
Protocol
No
Requests over HTTP and HTTPS reference the same cached object.
If you want to return the different responses to http: and https: requests,
set cacheKeyPolicy.includeProtocol to true on the associated
routes.
Host
Yes
Different hosts don't reference the same cached objects.
If you have multiple hostnames directed at the same EdgeCacheService, and
they are serving the same content, set
cdnPolicy.excludeHost to true.
Path
Yes
Always included in the cache key and cannot be removed. The path is the
minimum representation of an object in cache.
Query parameters
Yes
If query parameters don't distinguish between different responses,
set cacheKeyPolicy.excludeQueryString to true.
If only some query parameters should be included in a cache key, set
includedQueryParameters or
excludedQueryParameters , as appropriate.
Headers
No
Set cacheKeyPolicy.includedHeaderNames with the names of
headers to include in the cache key.
Specifying multiple headers that combine to have a large range of
values (for example, the combined header values identify a single user)
dramatically lowers the cache hit rate
and can result in a higher eviction rate and reduced performance.
Cookies
No
Set cacheKeyPolicy.includedCookieNames with the names
of cookies to include in the cache key.
Specifying multiple cookies that combine to have a large range of
values (for example, the combined cookie values identify a single user)
dramatically lowers the cache hit rate
and can result in a higher eviction rate and reduced performance.
Note the following:
Cache keys are not attached to a configured origin, allowing you to update
an origin configuration (or replace the origin entirely) without risk of "flushing"
the cache (for example, when migrating origin storage between providers).
Cache keys are constrained to an EdgeCacheService. Different EdgeCacheServices have
different cache namespaces, which prevents you from accidentally caching
objects between prod, staging, and other testing environments, even if the
host, path, or other cache key components would match. Deleting an
EdgeCacheService effectively invalidates all cached objects for
that service.
Cache keys are not scoped to an individual route. Multiple routes might refer to the same
cache key, especially if those routes match on components that are not
included in the cache key, such as request headers or excluded parameters.
This can be useful if you want multiple routes to share the same cache but
return different response headers or CORS configuration.
Cache keys don't include URL rewrite configuration—for example, a cache key is based
on the user-facing request and not the final "rewritten" request.
When signed requests are configured on a route, the signed attributes are
not included in the cache key. The request is treated as if the (signed)
query parameters or path component, starting with edge-cache-token and
ending at the next path separator ("/"), are not part of the URL.
Include or exclude query parameters
You can include or exclude specific query parameters from a cache key by adding
the parameter name to the includedQueryParameters or excludedQueryParameters
cache key configuration on a given route.
For example, to include the contentID and country query parameters and
ignore all others from the cache key:
cdnPolicy :
cacheMode : CACHE_ALL_STATIC
defaultTtl : 86400s
cacheKeyPolicy :
includedQueryParameters : [ "contentID" , "country" ]
Make sure to include the query parameters that uniquely identify content, and
exclude those that don't. For example, exclude analytics query parameters,
playback session IDs, or other parameters that are only unique to the client.
Including more query parameters than necessary can decrease cache hit rates.
Alternatively, instead of specifying which parameters to include in the cache
key, you can choose which parameters to exclude from the cache key. For example,
to exclude client-specific playback ID and timestamp information from the cache
key, configure the following:
cdnPolicy :
cacheMode : CACHE_ALL_STATIC
defaultTtl : 86400s
cacheKeyPolicy :
excludedQueryParameters : [ "playback-id" , "timestamp" ]
For a given route, you can specify one of includedQueryParameters or
excludedQueryParameters .
If query parameters are never used to uniquely identify content across requests,
you can remove all query parameters from the cache key for a route. Do this by
setting excludeQueryString to true , as follows:
cdnPolicy :
cacheMode : CACHE_ALL_STATIC
defaultTtl : 3600s
cacheKeyPolicy :
excludeQueryString : true
If Signed requests are enabled on a route,
query parameters used for signing are not included in the query string, and are
ignored if included. Including the signed parameters in the cache key
effectively makes each user request unique, and requires that each request be
served from the origin.
Query parameter sorting
Query parameters ( query strings ) are sorted by default to improve cache hit
rates, because clients might re-order or otherwise request the same cached
object with a different order of query parameters.
For example, the query parameters b=world&a=hello&z=zulu&p=paris and
p=paris&a=hello&z=zulu&b=world are sorted as a=hello&b=world&p=paris&z=zulu
before the cache key is derived. This allows both requests to map to the same
cached object, avoiding an unnecessary request to (and response from) the
origin.
If there are multiple instances of a query parameter key, each with distinct
values, the parameters are sorted by their full value (for example, a=hello is
sorted ahead of a=world ). Sorting cannot be disabled.
Include headers
Header names are case-insensitive and are converted to lowercase by
Media CDN.
The following headers cannot be included in the cache key:
Any header starting with access-control-
Any header starting with sec-fetch-
accept-encoding
accept
authorization
connection
content-md5
content-type
cookie
date
forwarded
from
host
if-match
if-modified-since
if-none-match
origin
proxy-authorization
range
referer
referrer
user-agent
want-digest
x-csrf-token
x-csrftoken
x-forwarded-for
To include the HTTP method in the cache key, use the special header name
:method .
Include cookies
Cookie names are case-sensitive.
Cookies starting with edge-cache- in any variation of uppercase or lowercase
letters cannot be used in the cache key.
Revalidation, eviction, and expiry
Content delivery networks, including Media CDN, operate by
caching the most popular content as close to users as possible.
Media CDN's extensive storage, as well as
origin shielding , limits the need to evict even unpopular
content. Content that is accessed a small number of times per day might
eventually be evicted.
Cached responses that reach their configured TTL might not be
immediately evicted. For popular content, Media CDN
revalidates that the cached response is the latest version by issuing a
HEAD request to the origin to confirm that the headers have
not changed.
Responses that set a max-age or an s-maxage cache
directive or that use a TTL
override to specify a high TTL value (for example, 30
days) might not be stored in cache for the full TTL. There is no guarantee
that an object is stored in the cache for the full duration,
especially if it is infrequently accessed.
If you are seeing a high rate of evictions, you should ensure that you have
configured your cache keys to exclude parameters that don't uniquely identify a
response.
Other considerations
The following considerations might also apply with regard to caching.
Vary headers
The Vary header indicates that the response varies depending on the
client's request headers. If a Vary header is present in the response,
Media CDN doesn't cache it, unless the header specifies
either one of the headers that are configured as a
cache key setting or one of the following
values:
Accept: used to indicate which media types the client accepts
Accept-Encoding: used to indicate which compression types the client
accepts
Available-Dictionary: used to provide the hash of an available
dictionary for compression
Origin/X-Origin: typically used for cross-origin resource sharing
X-Goog-Allowed-Resources: supports Google Cloud organization
restriction
Sec-Fetch-Dest/Sec-Fetch-Mode/Sec-Fetch-Site: used to fetch metadata request
headers
Media CDN caches responses with a Vary header in the response by
using the value of the header as part of the cache key. If the Vary header in
the response has multiple values, they are sorted lexicographically to ensure
that the cache key is deterministic.
Media CDN caches up to 100 variants for a given cache key and
randomly evicts variants from the cache beyond that limit. When
explicitly invalidating the cache
for a given URL or cache tag, all variants are invalidated.
Bypass the cache
You can configure the BYPASS_CACHE cache mode on a route to intentionally
bypass the cache on matching requests. This can be useful if you need to bypass
the cache for a small fraction of non-critical traffic, or debug origin
connectivity.
For cases where you need to serve dynamic responses, such as API backends, we
recommend configuring an external Application Load Balancer .
It is recommended that you generally limit use of this to debugging scenarios,
to avoid unintentional origin load. Traffic egressed when bypassing the cache is
priced at internet egress rates .
Cache invalidation
See cache invalidation .
Byte-range requests
Media CDN supports HTTP range requests
as defined in
RFC 9110 .
In addition, Media CDN uses range requests to
fetch larger responses from the origin. This allows Media CDN to
cache individual byte ranges, and does not require the entire object to be fetched
at one time to be cached.
Objects larger than 1 MiB are fetched as byte-range requests
of up to 2 MiB each.
Responses up to 1 MiB can be fetched without support for byte
ranges at the origin.
Responses larger than 1 MiB aren't served if byte ranges are not supported on
the origin.
Origin support for byte range requests is determined by the following:
An HTTP status code of 200 (OK) or 206 (Partial Content).
A valid Content-Length or Content-Range response header.
A response validator ( ETag or Last-Modified ).
Individual origin fill requests for each byte range are logged as
discrete log entries and associated with their parent client request. You can
group these requests by matching the value of
jsonPayload.cacheKeyFingerprint for each request.
For more details about what is logged, see the
Cloud Logging documentation .
Multipart range requests
Media CDN supports multipart range requests, which enable users
to request multiple non-contiguous segments of a file in a single HTTP
request—for example, Range: bytes=0-499, 1000-1499 .
To maximize client performance and origin offload, Media CDN can
serve the requested individual byte ranges from its cache, consolidating them
into a single response with an HTTP 206 Partial Response status code to the
client with the Content-Type set to multipart/byteranges .
For cacheable responses, when a client requests a multipart range,
Media CDN optimizes the process by converting the request into a
set of single-part range requests. Each request is sized at 2 MB
to cover all the parts of byte ranges requested by the client.
Media CDN then uses the responses to generate a single multipart
response at the edge. This approach enables efficient cache utilization,
reduces redundant origin fetches and supports high-volume use-cases,
such as app store downloads and OS updates.
For non-cacheable content, Media CDN forwards the request to the origin directly.
Open-ended range requests
Media CDN supports "open ended" Range requests (for
example, a request with Range: bytes=0- ) that keep a request open
against the origin until the response is closed by the origin (for
example, the origin writes all bytes to the wire) or times out.
Note: Your origin infrastructure must also support streaming objects in response
to open-ended Range requests before they are fully written. Some origins,
such as Cloud Storage and Amazon S3, support open-ended range
requests, but only serve objects after they've been fully written.
Open-ended byte ranges are typically used by clients requesting Apple's
Low-Latency HLS
segments: as each CMAF chunk is written to the wire, the CDN can cache and
deliver that chunk to clients.
In other cases, such as when interoperability with DASH is not required, the
media playlist indicates to the player which bytes represent each chunk:
#EXTINF:4.08,
fs270.mp4
#EXT-X-PART:DURATION=1.02,URI="fs271.mp4",BYTERANGE=20000@0
#EXT-X-PART:DURATION=1.02,URI="fs271.mp4",BYTERANGE=23000@20000
#EXT-X-PART:DURATION=1.02,URI="fs271.mp4",BYTERANGE=18000@43000
#EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT:TYPE=PART,URI="fs271.mp4",BYTERANGE-START=61000
You can configure how long Media CDN waits between reads by using
the EdgeCacheOrigin.timeouts.readTimeout configuration value. This should
typically be configured to a multiple (for example, 2x) of your target duration.
Livestream expansion
Customers using Media CDN to deliver live streaming video can enable Livestream expansion, an optional feature that further optimizes the workflow for low-latency delivery.
Livestream expansion alters the caching layers used at the edge, which helps ensure improved Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics that are critical for live events.
Caching Behavior with Livestream expansion
Object size limit: When Livestream expansion is enabled, the maximum size of an object that can be cached in the edge caches is 25 MiB.
Objects larger than 25 MiB: Objects exceeding the 25 MiB limit are not stored in Media CDN edge caches. By default, Media CDN proxies all requests for these objects directly to your origin server, resulting in an origin request for every client request.
To protect your origin server from excessive load, you can enable an optional configuration. With this setting, Media CDN returns a 503 Service Unavailable response for cacheable objects larger than the 25 MiB limit, instead of proxying the request to the origin.
Note: Livestream expansion is an allowlist-only feature and is not enabled by default. To have this feature enabled for your Media CDN service, contact your Google Cloud Sales or Account team. They can help assess suitability for your live streaming workload and initiate the enablement process.
