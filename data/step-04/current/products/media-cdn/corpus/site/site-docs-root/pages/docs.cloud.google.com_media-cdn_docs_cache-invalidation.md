Invalidate cached content
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cache invalidation, sometimes called cache purging , is the process of
declaring cached content to be invalid. This causes the entry to be
removed from the cache and then refilled from the origin server the next time
that the content is requested.
Media CDN supports multiple ways of selecting content to be
invalidated, as follows:
Host and URL path
URL prefix (wildcard)
Cache tags, including built-in tags for status , origin , and
content-type
You can combine these invalidation parameters to target specific cached
responses and minimize origin load on the subsequent cache fill.
Supported invalidation syntax
The supported invalidation syntax is as follows:
Type
Syntax
Example
Host invalidation
Invalidate cached responses for the specified host.
gcloud edge-cache services invalidate-cache
SERVICE_NAME \
--host="media.example.com"
Path invalidation
Invalidate cached responses for the specified path or path prefix.
gcloud edge-cache services invalidate-cache
SERVICE_NAME \
--path="/content/1234/hls/*"
gcloud edge-cache services invalidate-cache
SERVICE_NAME \
--path="/videos/funny.mp4"
Cache tag invalidation on HTTP status code, origin name, or MIME type
Invalidate cached responses with a matching tag. Multiple tags are
treated as a boolean OR .
gcloud edge-cache services invalidate-cache
SERVICE_NAME \
--tags="status=404,origin=staging-origin"
gcloud edge-cache services invalidate-cache
SERVICE_NAME \
--tags="content-type=application/x-mpegurl"
Notes:
Up to 10 cache tags can be specified in a single invalidation request.
You can combine host , path , and tags
in a single invalidation request. They are treated as a boolean AND .
When multiple cache tags are specified, they are treated as a boolean OR . For
example, if you specify --tags="status=404,origin=staging-origin" ,
all responses with a cache tag of status=404 are invalidated,
as are all responses with a cache tag of origin=staging-origin .
Cache tags
Cache tags (or surrogate keys ) let you invalidate content based on
arbitrary metadata.
Note: Cache tags are different from cache
keys .
These tags are defined by the following:
Setting the Cache-Tag HTTP header in an origin response, with tags
specified as a comma-separated list of values.
Built-in tags based on the HTTP status code of the response, the MIME type
from the Content-Type HTTP response header, or the name of the origin that the
response was fetched from.
When multiple tags are specified in a single invalidation request, they are
treated as a boolean OR .
Consider the following example:
You have the following cached objects:
Cached object #1 with tags status=200 ,
content-type=video/mp4
Cached object #2 with tags status=404 ,
content-type=text/plain
Cached object #3 with tags status=200 ,
content-type=application/x-mpegurl
You issue a request to invalidate objects with
tags="status=200,content-type=text/plain"
Outcome: All three cached objects are invalidated at the same time. This is to
prevent having to specify all possible tag combinations, some of which might
be unknown.
Notes:
The default cache tags are not included in the client-facing response because
they reflect either existing headers (such as the status line or
Content-Type) or internal configuration details.
Cache tags sent by the origin in the Cache-Tag HTTP response header are
sent to the client. If you want to prevent these from being sent to the
client, use the responseHeadersToRemove feature on a routeRule to remove
the Cache-Tag header. For examples, see the
custom headers
documentation.
Built-in tags
Responses automatically have the following cache tags applied to support
invalidating content based on status code, MIME type, or the origin that the
content was fetched from. You don't need to specify these tags in your origin
responses.
Tag
Details
status= HTTP_STATUS_CODE
The status cache tag is set based on the returned HTTP
status code of the cached response.
For example, you can invalidate all cached HTTP 404 responses by
specifying status=404 in an invalidation request.
content-type= MIME_TYPE
The content-type cache tag is set based on the MIME type
set in the
Content-Type
HTTP response header.
For example, the MIME type of a HLS playlist is
application/x-mpegURL or vnd.apple.mpegURL .
This allows you to invalidate specific types of content.
origin= ORIGIN_NAME
The origin cache tag is set based on the name of the origin
the content was fetched from.
The origin value references
the value of .routing.routeRules[].origin , and allows you
to invalidate content from a misconfigured or potentially misbehaving
origin server.
Cache tag limitations
Cache tags have the following restrictions:
Must not exceed 120 bytes per tag
Must not exceed 4 KiB (4096 bytes) of total tag names per cached object
Must not exceed 50 tags per object, not including default tags added by
Media CDN
Must be a valid HTTP token name, as defined in Section 3.2.6 of HTTP RFC 7230
Must not include the built-in status= , origin= , or
content-type= prefixes (which are ignored).
Tags that do not fall within these limits or meet these requirements are
ignored. In some cases (such as when the response headers are too large),
the response fails and isn't cached.
Permissions
The networkservices.EdgeCacheServices.invalidateCache
permission controls access to the invalidateCache API .
This permission is included in the networkservices.edgeCacheAdmin and
networkservices.edgeCacheUser Identity and Access Management roles.
Examples
The following examples show how to invalidate cached responses for a
Media CDN service.
You can combine the host , path , and tags
fields in a single invalidation request to invalidate a specific set of content.
Invalidate by host
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Media CDN page.
Go to Media CDN
Click the Services tab.
Click a service.
Click the Cache invalidation tab.
To invalidate the cache by host, for Host , specify a hostname unless
you want to invalidate the path for all hostnames.
The hostname can't include * .
Click Invalidate and then click Confirm to indicate that you want
Media CDN to invalidate the content matching the host.
gcloud
gcloud edge-cache services invalidate-cache SERVICE_NAME \
--host= HOST
Replace the following:
SERVICE_NAME with the name of the
Edge Cache service.
HOST with the complete hostname of the
cache entry to be invalidated.
For example:
gcloud edge-cache services invalidate-cache SERVICE_NAME \
--host="media.example.com"
Invalidating all content associated with a host can be risky and impact
performance. Consider reducing the invalidation scope by providing a specific
path or relevant cache tags.
Invalidate by path
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Media CDN page.
Go to Media CDN
Click the Services tab.
Click a service.
Click the Cache invalidation tab.
To invalidate the cache by path, for Path , specify the path and the
filename—for example, /videos/funny.mp4 or /segments/e94a6b1f731/* .
Click Invalidate .
gcloud
gcloud edge-cache services invalidate-cache SERVICE_NAME \
--path= PREFIX
Replace the following:
SERVICE_NAME with the name of the
Edge Cache service.
HOST with the hostname of the
cache entries to be invalidated. To match on any hostname, omit the host
flag.
PREFIX with a path prefix ending in '*' that
matches cache entries to be invalidated.
For example:
gcloud edge-cache services invalidate-cache SERVICE_NAME \
--path="/segments/e94a6b1f731/*"
You can also invalidate an exact path by omitting the trailing *
character. Passing --path="/videos/funny.mp4" invalidates the
cached response (if any) matching that path.
Invalidate by cache tag
Note: Use host, path, and tags together to reduce the volume of cached content
invalidated at the same time. Invalidated responses are re-fetched from the
origin in full, and invalidating too much content at the same time can result in
increased load on your origin server.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Media CDN page.
Go to Media CDN
Click the Services tab.
Click a service.
Click the Cache invalidation tab.
To validate the cache by tags, for Cache tags , specify one or more
tags to invalidate the cache. Use spaces or commas to separate tags.
You can add a maximum of 10 cache tags for invalidation.
Click Invalidate .
gcloud
gcloud edge-cache services invalidate-cache SERVICE_NAME \
--tags= TAGS
Replace the following:
SERVICE_NAME with the name of the
Edge Cache service.
TAGS with a comma-separated list of tags.
For example:
gcloud edge-cache services invalidate-cache SERVICE_NAME \
--tags="status=404,content-type=text/plain"
Invalidation latency
Cache invalidation across Media CDN's thousands of locations
typically completes within one minute globally.
In some cases, invalidation can take longer, depending on system load,
connectivity, and the volume of content being invalidated.
Logging
If audit logs are enabled, invalidation calls are logged to Cloud Logging.
Limitations
Invalidations are rate-limited. If you exceed the invalidations rate limit ,
you get an HTTP 429 error message with the status RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED .
An invalidation can be of any size. For example, invalidating
/images/my-image.png counts as one invalidation. Invalidating /images/* also
counts as one invalidation.
