Request logging overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Media CDN logs each HTTP request to Cloud Logging. These requests
include client requests to the EdgeCacheService resource and requests from
the EdgeCacheOrigin resource to the configured origin for cache fills. Logs are
typically delivered in near real time. This includes being queryable in
Logging and exportable to Cloud Storage and Pub/Sub.
Log entries contain the following types of information:
General information shown in most Google Cloud logs, such as severity,
the project ID, the project number, and the timestamp.
HttpRequest log
fields.
Additional metadata about the request within the structPayload, including
the following:
Client ASN
Client location data
ID (city) of the caches used to fulfill the response
Time to first byte (TTFB) and time to last byte (TTLB), in milliseconds,
for the HTTP-level response
TLS SNI hostname
TLS version used
Common Media Client Data (CMCD) information
Cache-specific fields
The jsonPayload object of a Media CDN log contains metadata
specific to how Media CDN serves an object, whether the object
was cached, and any error states encountered.
These fields, as well as example values, are shown in the following table.
Field
Example value
Details
backendInitialLatency
0.126644940s
The Duration
it takes the backend to initially respond to a request. Measured from when
the CDN has finished proxying the request to the origin until the CDN begins receiving
response bytes from the origin.
This field appears only in logs for cache fill from an EdgeCacheOrigin resource.
backendLatency
0.126666342s
The Duration it takes the backend to fully respond to a request. Measured from when the CDN
has finished proxying the request to the origin until the CDN has received the complete
response from the backend.
This field appears only in logs for cache fill from an EdgeCacheOrigin resource.
cacheId
maa-123456
The IATA (airport) code of the city nearest the cache and an opaque identifier of the cache
instance. If multiple tiers of caching are required to serve the request due to a full or
partial cache miss, the chain of cache locations is provided—for
example, del-234567, bom-345678, sin-456789 , where the rightmost cache is the
closest to the user.
cacheKeyFingerprint
f63925711b0dd8a9ff861cd303774e6e
An opaque fingerprint of the cache key. Requests that map to the
same cache key—for example, requests where query parameters
are not included, or where the host is not included—should
have the same fingerprint.
If your total number of requests is similar to the total number of
unique fingerprints, it might indicate that your cache keys are too
specific.
cacheMode
USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS
The cdnPolicy.cacheMode configured on the route that
matched this request.
cacheStatus
Cache hit: hit
Full cache miss: fetch, miss, miss
The cache status at each cache node between the user and the
origin shield, where the rightmost value represents the cache closest
to the user. For more information about how to interpret this field,
see Cache status values .
clientAsn
The ASN (Autonomous System Number), based on the connecting
client's IP address.
clientCity
Mountain View
Name of the city from which the request originated—for example,
Mountain View, California.
This can also be added to both request and response headers and
mirrors the client_city header variable.
clientRegionCode
US
The country (or region) associated with the client's IP address.
This is a Unicode CLDR region code, such as US or FR. For most
countries, these codes correspond directly to ISO-3166-2 codes.
This can also be added to both request and response headers and
mirrors the client_region header variable.
cmcd
The CMCD
keys in the client request that help inform the client-side quality of
service. Media CDN supports data transmitted through
HTTP request headers or query parameters and does not log values for the following keys:
dl (deadline), nor (next object request),
nrr (next range request), ot (object type),
rtp (requested maximum throughput), sf (streaming format),
su (startup), tb (top bitrate),
or v (CMCD version).
compressionAlgorithmApplied
br
The algorithm used to compress the response referred to in this log
entry. Possible values include br and gzip .
enforcedSecurityPolicy
The Google Cloud Armor edge
security policy that applies to the client's request. This includes
additional information about the policy name, the priority, and the
action taken. It also includes information about
Google Threat Intelligence evaluations, if applicable.
flexShieldingRegion
US_EAST4
The region used for flexible shielding, if any.
This field appears only in logs for cache fill from an
EdgeCacheOrigin resource.
flexShieldingStatus
SHIELDED
The status of flexible shielding for a cache fill request. The value can be
one of the following:
DEFAULT_GLOBAL : indicates that flexible shielding isn't
configured
SHIELDED : indicates that the region configured using
flexShieldingRegion was used to serve the request
SPILLED : indicates that the region configured using
flexShieldingRegion couldn't be used for the request;
the default origin was used
This field appears only in logs for cache fill from an
EdgeCacheOrigin resource.
httpTtfb
0.157228207s
The Duration from when the proxy begins receiving request bytes until the first byte of the
response is sent (not received).
latency
0.157415635s
The Duration from when the proxy begins receiving request bytes until it has finished writing
the response to the client.
location
The Location header in the response.
metroIataCode
MAA
The IATA (airport) code of the city nearest the proxy.
origin
The EdgeCacheOrigin resource from which the response was proxied.
originalRequestId
19d92668-3948-49d8-9244-25f8252043e4
The unique identifier assigned to the request that originally generated this response.
Populated only if this is different than request_id for cached responses.
originIp
The IP address used to contact the EdgeCacheOrigin resource from which
the response was proxied.
previewSecurityPolicy
The Google Cloud Armor edge security policy that
applies to the client's request, with the preview rules taken into account. This includes additional information about the policy name,
the priority, and the action taken.
proxyRegionCode
US
The country (or region) that the proxy is located in. This is a Unicode CLDR region code,
such as US or FR. For most countries, these codes correspond directly to ISO-3166-2 codes.
proxyStatus
A list of intermediary HTTP proxies in the response path. The value
is defined by RFC 9209 .
This corresponds to the proxy_status dynamic header variable .
rangeHeader
The Range header in the request.
requestId
4bde6381-cd17-47e1-8c2a-1aaa424a1156
The unique identifier assigned to the request by the proxy.
tlsCipherSuite
009C
The cipher suite negotiated during the TLS handshake. The value is four
hex digits defined by the IANA TLS Cipher Suite Registry—for example,
009C for TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256. This value is empty for
unencrypted client connections.
tlsSniHostname
Server name indication (as defined in RFC 6066), if provided by the client during the TLS
or QUIC handshake. The hostname is converted to lowercase and any trailing dot is removed.
tlsVersion
TLS 1.3
TLS version negotiated between the client and the CDN during the
SSL handshake. Possible values include TLS 1, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and
TLS 1.3.

You can configure request logging
in a few ways. To reduce log volume and overall Logging charges,
logs can optionally be sampled or filtered as needed.
You can also route logs to Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, or BigQuery
for analysis in Google Cloud or your existing log analysis tools.
Retention policies
Logging supports setting custom retention
policies , including on a per-sink basis.
