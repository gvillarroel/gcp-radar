Configure SSL (TLS) certificates
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
After you have created a Media CDN service
(or services), you can issue and attach SSL (TLS) certificates to
support secure connectivity in browsers and mobile applications.
Issue a managed certificate
To create a managed certificate and attach it to your Media CDN
service, you must do the following:
Demonstrate ownership ("authorization") of the domains that you want to
issue certificates for by creating a challenge token and adding a DNS
record.
Create a certificate of type EDGE_CACHE with one or more domain names based
on that authorization.
Attach that certificate to one or more Edge Cache services.
You must have the following Identity and Access Management permissions to authorize, create, and
attach certificates to an Edge Cache service:
certificatemanager.certs.create
certificatemanager.certs.get
certificatemanager.certs.list
certificatemanager.certs.use
certificatemanager.dnsauthorizations.create
certificatemanager.dnsauthorizations.get
certificatemanager.dnsauthorizations.list
certificatemanager.dnsauthorizations.use
Users who need to attach an existing certificate to an
Media CDN
service require the certificatemanager.certs.get ,
certificatemanager.certs.list , and certificatemanager.certs.use
IAM permissions.
Before you begin
You must have a registered domain name that you can update public DNS records
on.
Read the SSL certificates overview .
Create a DNS authorization
First, you must create a DNS authorization to demonstrate ownership of
the domain before you can issue certificates for it. The DNS authorization uses
the DNS-01
ACME
challenge, and lets you issue a certificate before directing user-facing traffic
to your Edge Cache service.
Set the value of domain to the domain name you intend to create a certificate
for, as follows:
Note: The Google Cloud CLI support for Certificate Manager requires
gcloud CLI version 392.0.0 (version 327.0.0 for gcloud
beta support) or later. Use gcloud version and gcloud components update to
check the version and update your installed Google Cloud CLI.
gcloud
Use the gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations command:
gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations create DOMAIN_NAME_AUTH \
--domain=" DOMAIN_NAME "
gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations describe DOMAIN_NAME_AUTH
The gcloud CLI returns a response with the details of the DNS record
that you need to add.
createTime: '2022-01-14T13:35:00.258409106Z'
dnsResourceRecord:
data: 0e40fc77-a37d-4eb8-8fe1-eea2e18d12d9.4.authorize.certificatemanager.goog.
name: _acme-challenge.example.com.
type: CNAME
domain: example.com
name: projects/myProject/locations/global/dnsAuthorizations/myAuthorization
updateTime: '2022-01-14T13:35:01.571086137Z'
Terraform
resource "google_certificate_manager_dns_authorization" "default" {
name = "example-dns-auth"
description = "example dns authorization "
domain = "test.example.com"
}
Key Point: The record must be added at the authoritative DNS provider for your
domain. Certificate Manager regularly polls the domain for the record and updates
the status of the authorization after the (valid) record is found.
If you are using Cloud DNS for your domain, see
the steps for adding a new record
to your hosted domain. If you are using another DNS provider, consult their
documentation for adding a CNAME record.
You can repeat this step for each domain you need to issue a
certificate for.
Certificates can contain multiple domains, or you can choose to issue a
certificate per domain, as needed. After you have an authorization for a
domain, you can use it to issue certificates.
We recommend creating fewer total certificates, each with all of the
domain names used for your service. This improves client performance when
using multiple domains because clients can benefit from TLS resumption more
often.
Each Edge Cache service can reference up to five
certificates. By issuing fewer certificates, you can stay within this
limit.
Note: Ensure that the DNS record used for domain control validation (DCV) is not
deleted, even after the certificate is issued. Certificate Manager
requires this record to renew certificates. If you delete this record,
Certificate Manager can't renew your certificates, which can result in downtime
for your service.
If you need to retrieve the DNS record values at a later date, make a request
for the authorizationName that you provided when creating the DNS
authorization:
Create a certificate
After you have added the DNS record demonstrating ownership of the domain(s) you
want to create a certificate for, you can issue a certificate creation request.
The list of dnsAuthorizations must match the names of existing
authorizations you created earlier in the process. If you want to add multiple
domains to the same certificate, provide a list of domains[] and matching
dnsAuthorizations[] when making the request.
To create a certificate using an authorization for test.example.com called
test-example-com :
gcloud
Use the gcloud certificate-manager certificates command:
gcloud certificate-manager certificates create CERTIFICATE_NAME \
--domains=" DOMAIN_NAME " \
--dns-authorizations=" DOMAIN_NAME_AUTH " \
--scope=EDGE_CACHE
This creates a certificate with each DNS authorization in the AUTHORIZING
state and the certificate in the PROVISIONING state:
Create request issued for: [ DOMAIN_NAME ]
Waiting for operation [projects/my-project/locations/global/operations/operatio
n-1613425627385-5bb66ed644e91-3e2a2f1f-71979cf8] to complete...done.
Created certificate [ CERTIFICATE_NAME ].
Terraform
resource "google_certificate_manager_certificate" "default" {
name = "example-dns-cert"
description = "example dns certificate"
scope = "EDGE_CACHE"
managed {
domains = [
google_certificate_manager_dns_authorization.default.domain ,
]
dns_authorizations = [
google_certificate_manager_dns_authorization.default.id ,
]
}
}
It might take a few minutes (and up to an hour) for the certificate creation to
complete, depending on the following:
How fast your DNS provider propagates configuration changes.
How many domains you are attempting to validate and create certificates for.
The state field displays the current status of the certificate:
PROVISIONING - the certificate is still being provisioned. This
is likely because the certificate creation request was only recently made.
FAILED - returned after multiple attempts to validate the domain
or issue the certificate. For details, see the provisioning_issue ,
authorization_attempt_info and failure_reason fields.
ACTIVE - the domain was successfully validated and the certificate
has been provisioned.
To check the status of the certificate:
gcloud
Use the gcloud certificate-manager certificates command:
gcloud certificate-manager certificates describe CERTIFICATE_NAME
In this example, the DNS authorization is AUTHORIZED and the certificate
state is ACTIVE :
createTime : '2021-02-07T20:03:39.867762684Z'
expireTime : '2021-03-09T19:20:41Z'
managed :
authorizationAttemptInfo :
- domain : DOMAIN_NAME
state : AUTHORIZED
dnsAuthorizations :
- projects/111111111111/locations/global/dnsAuthorizations/test-example-com
domains :
- DOMAIN_NAME
state : ACTIVE
name : projects/my-project/locations/global/certificates/test-example-com
scope : EDGE_CACHE
subjectAlternativeNames :
- DOMAIN_NAME
updateTime : '2021-02-07T20:03:40.297242738Z'
After the certificate is ACTIVE , you can attach it to an
Edge Cache service .
Note: All certificates issued by Google Cloud (as well as most other certificate
providers) are logged to public Certificate
Transparency (CT)
logs.
Attach a certificate to a service
After you have created a managed certificate , you can
associate it with one or more of your Edge Cache services.
Certificates can be attached to both existing and new services by updating the
list of edgeSslCertificates in the service.
You must have the following IAM permissions to attach
certificates to an Edge Cache service:
certificatemanager.certs.get
certificatemanager.certs.list
certificatemanager.certs.use
networkservices.edgeCacheServices.get
networkservices.edgeCacheServices.list
networkservices.edgeCacheServices.update
Note: Ensure that you have a routing.hostRules[].hosts[] entry that matches at
least one of the domains on an attached certificate. Without a hostname to match
against, Media CDN returns an HTTP 404 to the client.
To attach a certificate to a service, complete the following steps.
gcloud
Run the gcloud edge-cache services export command to export your service's
YAML file:
gcloud edge-cache services export MY_SERVICE \
--destination=my-service.yaml
Edit the exported YAML file to add your certificate:
name: MY_SERVICE
edgeSslCertificates:
- projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/certificates/ CERTIFICATE_NAME
Run the gcloud edge-cache services import command:
gcloud edge-cache services import MY_SERVICE \
--source=my-service.yaml
Output:
Request issued for: [ MY_SERVICE ]
Updated service [ MY_SERVICE ]
The command returns a description of your service, including the
list of edgeSslCertificates now attached:
name: MY_SERVICE
edgeSslCertificates:
- projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/certificates/ CERTIFICATE_NAME
After you update the configuration, the certificate propagates to all edge
locations within minutes. To test that the certificate is associated with your
Edge Cache service before making DNS changes, you can issue a request against
the IPv4 or IPv6 address associated with your service.
Replace and remove certificates
Certificates can be added and removed by updating the list of certificates.
When using the gcloud CLI's --edge-ssl-certificate flag,
certificates are only appended to the list of existing certificates, and not
replaced. This prevents you from accidentally removing a valid, active
certificate accidentally.
To remove the test-example-com certificate from our service in the following
example, you can export your service to YAML using the
import and export commands
name : my-service
edgeSslCertificates :
- projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/certificates/test-example-com
- projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/certificates/ CERTIFICATE_NAME
The following commands show how to export the service, remove the certificate
reference, and import the updated service.
gcloud
Use the gcloud edge-cache services command:
gcloud edge-cache services export MY_SERVICE --destination=my-service.yaml
Exported [projects/my-project/locations/global/edgeCacheServices/ MY_SERVICE ] to 'my-service.yaml'.
Remove the certificates you no longer want the service to use by using your
preferred text editor:
name: MY_SERVICE
edgeSslCertificates:
- projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/certificates/ CERTIFICATE_NAME
Save the modified file, and then import the updated service:
gcloud
Use the gcloud edge-cache services command:
gcloud edge-cache services import MY_SERVICE --source=my-service.yaml
Request issued for: [ MY_SERVICE ]
Updated service [ MY_SERVICE ].
There is no limit to the number of services a certificate can be associated
with, and each Edge Cache service can reference up to five certificates.
Self-managed certificates
Note: We strongly recommend using managed certificates ,
to avoid the risk of a certificate accidentally expiring.
You can upload your own certificates to Media CDN if you have
specific use-cases that require it.
To upload a certificate and its associated key to Certificate Manager:
gcloud
Use the gcloud certificate-manager certificates command. Make sure
you specify --scope=EDGE_CACHE for certificates associated with
Media CDN.
gcloud certificate-manager certificates create stream-example-com \
--certificate-file= CERT .pem \
--private-key-file= PRIVATE_KEY .pem \
--scope=EDGE_CACHE
Create request issued for: [stream-example-com]
Created certificate [stream-example-com].
After the certificate has been uploaded, you can
attach it to an EdgeCacheService
as you would a managed certificate.
