gcloud and YAML
Export your Media CDN configuration
into a YAML file. Use the
gcloud edge-cache services export command .
gcloud edge - cache services export SERVICE_NAME \
-- destination = FILENAME . yaml
Replace the following:
SERVICE_NAME : the name of your service
FILENAME : the name of your YAML file
Update the YAML file with the required configuration as described in the
sections on this page.
To update the service, import your Media CDN configuration
from the YAML file. Use the
gcloud edge-cache services import command .
gcloud edge - cache services import SERVICE_NAME \
-- source = FILENAME . yaml
Match requests
A Media CDN configuration contains a set of routes defined in the
Routing
section for an
EdgeCacheService
resource.
These routes match requests based on (at least) a host. For more details about how
traffic is directed to an origin, see
HostRule
and PathMatcher .
Each route is able to define its own CDN configuration, rewrites, redirects,
CORS policies, custom HTTP headers, and origin mapping.
Routes can share origins.
For example, you can route requests for manifests to a specific origin and
define a short-lived cache TTL and a
negative caching policy .
Requests for segments can be split to another origin by using
headers and query parameters
to break out specific manifest types or users.
The following example shows how to route requests that match a specific header,
query parameter, and path prefix for the host media.example.com :
name : prod-service
routing :
hostRules :
- hosts :
- media.example.com
pathMatcher : example_routes
pathMatchers :
- name : example_routes
routeRules :
- priority : 10
origin : staging-live-origin
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : /vod/
headerMatches :
- headerName : "x-staging-client"
presentMatch : true
queryParameterMatches :
- name : "live"
exactMatch : "yes"
routeAction :
cdnPolicy :
defaultTtl : 5s
Path matching
Media CDN supports full (exact), prefix, and wildcard path matching.
Path matching can be combined with host, header, and query parameter-based
matching to construct fine-grained request routing rules.
Following are three ways to match on a URL path.
Field
Description
Example
matchRules[].fullPathMatch
The fullPathMatch condition matches the full URL path,
which does not include the query string. You must specify trailing
slashes, if relevant.
A route with a match rule of fullPathMatch: "/stream/"
matches /stream/ but not /stream or
/stream/us/hls/1234.ts .
A fullPathMatch is an explicit (exact) match.
matchRules[].prefixMatch
The prefixMatch condition matches the URL path prefix; URLs
that start with the same string match.
A route with a match rule of prefixMatch: "/videos/"
matches both /videos/hls/58481314/manifest.m3u8 and
/videos/dash because they both contain the /videos/
prefix.
matchRules[].pathTemplateMatch
The pathTemplateMatch condition supports
wildcard operators, allowing you to match complex URL patterns and path
segments, as well as capture named variables for rewriting URLs.
A route with a match rule of
pathTemplateMatch: "/**.m3u8" matches any URL path ending
with .m3u8 .
Both /content/en-GB/13/51491/manifest_193193.m3u8 and
/p/abc/1234/manifest_1080p5000.m3u8 match this pattern.
For more examples, see the
pattern matching section.
For more details, see the API specification for
MatchRule .
Caution: A route must have a matchRule with exactly one of prefixMatch ,
fullPathMatch , or pathTemplateMatch defined. If you don't include one of
those fields, the API returns an error.
For example, to match all requests starting with /stream/ , create a route rule
similar to the following:
name : prod-service
routing :
hostRules :
- hosts :
- media.example.com
- * .vod.example.com
pathMatcher : example_routes
pathMatchers :
- name : example_routes
routeRules :
- priority : 1
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : /stream/
This example explicitly includes the trailing slash in the match rule:
A request to media.example.com/stream/id/1234/hls/manifest.m3u8 matches
this route.
A request to media.example.com/stream-eu/id/4567/hls/manifest.m3u8 does
not match this route.
In the second case, Media CDN returns an HTTP 404 error,
unless there was another route or a catch-all route
configured.
For guidance about how predecence works for routes with similar prefixes, see
the route priority and ordering section.
Pattern (wildcard) matching
Pattern matching lets you match multiple parts of a URL, including partial URLs
and suffixes (file extensions), by using wildcard syntax.
You can also associate one or more path segments with named variables in a
pathTemplateMatch field, and then refer to those variables when rewriting the URL in
a pathTemplateRewrite field. This lets you reorder and remove URL segments before
the request is sent to your origin.
The following example shows how you can match on two different URL suffixes:
# EdgeCacheService.routing.pathMatchers[]
routeRules :
- priority : 1
description : "Match video segments"
matchRules :
- pathTemplateMatch : "/**.ts"
- pathTemplateMatch : "/**.m4s"
origin : prod-video-storage
The supported syntax includes the following.
Operator
Matches
Example
*
Matches a single path segment, up to the next path separator: /
/videos/*/*/*.m4s matches
/videos/123414/hls/1080p5000_00001.m4s .
**
Matches zero or more path segments. If present, must be the last operator.
/**.mpd matches
/content/123/india/dash/55/manifest.mpd .
{name} or {name=*}
A named variable matching one path segment.
Matches a single path segment, up to the next path separator:
/ .
/content/{format}/{lang}/{id}/{file}.vtt matches
/content/hls/en-us/12345/en_193913.vtt and captures
format="hls" , lang="en-us" , id="12345" ,
and file="en_193913" as variables.
{name=videos/*}
A named variable matching more than one path segment. The path segment
matching videos/* is captured as the named variable.
/videos/{language=lang/*}/* matches
/videos/lang/en/video.m4s and populates the path variable
language with the value lang/en .
{name=**}
A named variable matching zero or more path segments.
If present, must be the last operator.
/**.m3u8 or /{path=**}.m3u8 matches all
path segments up to the extension.
/videos/{file=**} matches
/videos/en-GB/def566/manifest.m3u8 , including the
extension, and captures the path variable
file="en-GB/def566/manifest.m3u8 .
Notes:
If you aren't rewriting a URL, use the simpler * and ** operators.
When using variables to capture path segments, any parts of the URL that
aren't captured by a variable can't be referenced in a subsequent
pathTemplateRewrite . For an example, see the
capturing path variables section.
You can't refer to variables in a subsequent pathTemplateRewrite that
don't exist in the pathTemplateMatch on the same route.
Variables are case-sensitive, with {FORMAT} , {forMAT} , and {format}
representing different variables and values.
You can specify up to 10 operators (wildcards or variables) in a match.
The pathTemplateMatch and pathTemplateRewrite fields must not exceed 255
characters.
Example: Match on a file extension
The following example shows a common use-case for wildcard operators: matching
all path segments up to a suffix.
In this case, you do the following:
Fetch video manifests (playlists) ending in .m3u8 and .mpd from the
manifest origin, applying a short (5-second) TTL to these responses because
they change regularly.
Fetch video segments ending in .ts and .m4s from the segment origin, and
apply a longer (1-day) TTL to these responses.
This approach is often employed when using SSAI (Server-Side Ad Injection) or
DAI (Dynamic Ad Insertion) services, and for live video where the manifest is
updated every few seconds.
The following configuration demonstrates how to configure your
Media CDN routing to support this:
name : prod-service
routing :
hostRules :
- hosts :
- media.example.com
pathMatcher : example_routes
pathMatchers :
- name : example_routes
routeRules :
# the first route only matches video manifests
- priority : 1
matchRules :
- pathTemplateMatch : "/**.m3u8" # "**" matches all path segments
- pathTemplateMatch : "/**.mpd"
origin : manifest-origin
routeAction :
cdnPolicy :
cacheMode : FORCE_CACHE_ALL
defaultTtl : 5s
# the second route matches video segments, fetches them
# from a separate origin server, caching them for a longer
# duration (1 day).
- priority : 2
matchRules :
- pathTemplateMatch : "/**.ts"
- pathTemplateMatch : "/**.m4s"
origin : segment-origin
routeAction :
cdnPolicy :
cacheMode : FORCE_CACHE_ALL
defaultTtl : 86400s
Example: Capture path variables
The following example shows how to use named variables to describe one or more
path segments.
These variables can be used in a pathTemplateRewrite to rewrite the path prior
to the request being sent to the origin, or to make a complex
pathTemplateMatch self-describing.
routing :
hostRules :
- hosts :
- media.example.com
pathMatcher : example_routes
pathMatchers :
- name : example_routes
routeRules :
- priority : 1
matchRules :
# Matches a request of "/us/en/hls/123139139/segments/00001.ts"
- pathTemplateMatch : "/{country}/{lang}/{format}/{id}/{file=**}"
origin : my-origin
routeAction :
urlRewrite :
# Rewrites to "/123139139/hls/segments/00001.ts"
pathTemplateRewrite : "/{id}/{format}/{file}"
Specifically:
Each {name} variable captures a single path segment. A path segment is all
characters between a pair of / ("slashes") in a URL path.
A variable of {name=**} captures all remaining path segments; in this
case, it matches both segments/00001.ts and master.m3u8 .
In the pathTemplateRewrite on the same route , you refer back to some
of the variables that you captured in the pathTemplateMatch . You explicitly
omit the {country} and {lang} variables because they don't match the
directory structure on the origin.
With this example, the following occurs:
An incoming request URL of /us/en/hls/123139139/segment_00001.ts matches
the pathTemplateMatch and is rewritten to
/123139139/hls/segment_00001.ts prior to being sent to the origin.
An incoming request URL of /us/123139139/master.m3u8 does not match the
pathTemplateMatch , and receives an HTTP 404 (Not Found) status code.
An incoming request URL of /br/es/dash/c966cbbe6ae3/subtitle_00001.vtt
also matches the pathTemplateMatch and is rewritten to
/c966cbbe6ae3/dash/subtitle_00001.vtt prior to being sent to the origin.
To learn more about how wildcard matching interoperates with URL rewriting, see
the rewrites section.
Host matching
Each service can match on multiple hostnames, with each set of hostnames containing
their own group of routes (known as path matchers ). In the most common case,
all hostnames for a service map to a single set of shared routes with a single
list of hosts and a single path matcher.
name : prod-service
routing :
hostRules :
- hosts :
- media.example.com
- * .vod.example.com
pathMatcher : example_routes
pathMatchers :
- name : example_routes
routeRules :
# list of routes for the configured hosts
- priority : 999
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : /
origin : DEFAULT_ORIGIN
Hosts that don't match are served a default HTTP 404 page. To accept any host,
you can include the wildcard character * as a hostRules[].hosts[] entry.
You can also define groups of routes (for example, grouping by country or live
versus on-demand). Because each service has a single security policy, we
generally recommend having one service for each market (geography) or workload
that you have.
Notes:
Host (or HTTP/2 :authority ) headers that contain a port are implicitly
matched against a configured host. You don't need to explicitly specify the
ports.
If the request is over HTTP, a hostRules[].hosts[] entry of
*.vod.example.com matches us.vod.example.com and
us.vod.example.com:80 .
If the request is over HTTPS (TLS), a hostRules[].hosts[] entry of
*.vod.example.com matches us.vod.example.com:443 .
For more details, see the API specification for
HostRule .
Match on headers and query parameters
You can configure routes to match on specific header and query parameter names,
as well as the presence of a header value (prefix, suffix, or exact match).
Query parameter and header matching are logical "AND"—the request must match
all of the query parameters and header keys (and values, if specified) to match
the given route.
For example, if you want to route requests with a specific header field name and
header value to an origin named alternate-origin , configure your match
conditions within routeRules[].matchRules[].headerMatches[] :
name : prod-service
routing :
hostRules :
- hosts :
- media.example.com
pathMatcher : example_routes
pathMatchers :
- name : example_routes
routeRules :
- priority : 1
origin : alternate-origin
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : "/videos/"
headerMatches :
- headerName : "x-device-name"
exactMatch : "roku"
In this example, requests with /videos/ at the beginning of the URL and the
x-device-name: roku header match this route. Requests missing this header
name or with a different value don't match this route.
Note: If you have routes that match the same request path at a higher priority
than routes that specify additional header and query parameter matching
conditions, the lower priority routes are not matched. Ensure that routes with
more specific matching conditions have a higher (smaller number) priority set.
For more details, see the API specification for
HeaderMatch .
Similarly, to match against query parameters, specify one or more
queryParameterMatches as follows:
name : prod-service
routing :
hostRules :
- hosts :
- media.example.com
pathMatcher : example_routes
pathMatchers :
- name : example_routes
routeRules :
- priority : 1
origin : eu-live-origin-prod
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : "/videos/"
queryParameterMatches :
- name : "playback_type"
exactMatch : "live"
- name : "geo"
exactMatch : "eu"
In this example, a client request of
https://cdn.example.com/videos/1234/abcd/xyz.m3u8?playback_type=live&geo=eu
matches this route.
For more details, see the API specification for
QueryParameterMatcher .
Define a catch-all (default) route
By default, Media CDN returns an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error if a request
doesn't match any configured routes.
To configure a catch-all route, for a given pathMatcher (collection of
routes), do the following:
Create a routeRule with the lowest priority (highest number)—for example,
999, which is the lowest possible route priority.
Configure a matchRule with a prefix match of / (matches all request
paths).
Configure (one of) an origin or urlRedirect on the route.
For example, to configure a catch-all route that directs all unmatched requests
to a default origin named my-origin , create a new route with priority: 999
and a matchRules[].prefixMatch of / as follows:
name : prod-service
routing :
hostRules :
- hosts :
- cdn.example.com
pathMatcher : example_routes
pathMatchers :
- name : example_routes
routeRules :
- priority : 999
origin : my-origin
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : /
You can optionally rewrite the URL prior to the origin fetch, or redirect to a
default page (such as your landing page) instead of sending the request "as is"
to the origin.
Route priority and ordering
Each route in an array of routeRules[] must have a priority associated with
it.
More specific routes should be set to a higher priority (smaller number). A
route matching a prefix of /stream/ with a priority of 1 otherwise prevents a
more specific route of /stream/live/eu/ with a priority of 5 from matching any
requests.
The highest priority route is "1", and the lowest is "999".
You can't configure two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority
for each rule must be set to a number between 1 and 999 inclusive.
Defining a catch-all route lets you send all
non-matching requests to a default origin or redirect
them to a landing page or endpoint.
In the following example, you can see that the /live/us/ route would never be
matched because the /live/ route is at a higher priority:
routeRules :
- priority : 1
description : "Live routes"
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : /live/
routeAction :
cdnPolicy :
defaultTtl : 5s
- priority : 2
description : "U.S based live streams"
matchRules :
# This would never be matched, as the /live/ prefixMatch at priority 1
# would always take precedence.
- prefixMatch : /live/us/
routeAction :
cdnPolicy :
defaultTtl : 5s
- priority : 999
description : "Catch-all route"
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : /
To address this, you put the more specific (longer) route at a higher priority:
routeRules :
- priority : 1
description : "U.S based live streams"
matchRules :
# The more specific (longer) match is at a higher priority, and now
# matches requests as expected.
- prefixMatch : /live/us/
routeAction :
cdnPolicy :
defaultTtl : 5s
- priority : 2
description : "Live routes"
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : /live/
routeAction :
cdnPolicy :
defaultTtl : 5s
- priority : 999
description : "Catch-all route"
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : /
This allows the more specific route to match requests correctly. A request
prefixed with /live/eu/ would still fall through to the /live/ route at
priority 2.
Method filtering
By default, Media CDN proxies only GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS
methods to your origin and filters out the methods that can modify your origin.
You can override this default behavior for a specific route rule by specifying
the methods that you would like proxied to your origin. Besides GET , HEAD ,
and OPTIONS , Media CDN supports PUT , POST , DELETE , and
PATCH .
Media CDN only retries or attempts failover for requests that
use the safer HTTP methods, such as GET , HEAD , or OPTIONS .
Note: If a request using an unsafe method fails on the first attempt to the
primary origin, Media CDN responds to the client
with an HTTP 502 Bad Gateway status code. It doesn't attempt any retries
or failover to another origin. For more information on retries, see
Retry origin requests .
To configure support for a set of methods for a route rule, specify a
routeMethods section that has an allowed_methods value for each method.
routeRules :
- priority : 5
description : "Video uploads"
routeMethods :
allowedMethods : [ "PUT" , "POST" , "OPTIONS" ]
matchRules :
- pathTemplateMatch : "/uploads/**.ts"
origin : prod-video-storage
- priority : 10
description : "Video serving"
routeMethods :
allowedMethods : [ "GET" , "HEAD" ]
matchRules :
- pathTemplateMatch : "/videos/**.ts"
origin : prod-video-storage
Path normalization
Path normalization describes how Media CDN combines multiple
representations of a URL into a single, canonical representation under specific
scenarios.
Path normalization can directly improve cache hit rates by reducing the number
of request URLs that represent the same content, and by mitigating origin errors
for origins that expect normalized paths.
Incoming requests are normalized as per the following:
Multiple consecutive slashes are merged into a single slash. For example, a
URL path of /videos///12345/manifest.mpd is normalized to
/videos/12345/manifest.mpd .
Path segments are normalized according to
RFC 3986 Section 6.2.2.3 .
For example, the path /a/b/c/./../../g is normalized to /a/g based on
the
" remove dot segments "
algorithm defined in RFC 3986. This normalization happens before checking
the cache or forwarding the request to the origin.
Requests are not percent-encoding normalized. For example, a URL with a
percent-encoded slash character ( %2F ) is not decoded into the un-encoded
form.
URLs remain case-sensitive and are not case-normalized. Many URLs contain
case-sensitive base64 encodings, including URLs with
signed request tokens.
Rewrites and redirects
The following sections provide examples on how to rewrite requests and configure
redirects.
Rewrite request URLs
Media CDN supports host and path rewrites. Rewrites change the
URL sent to the origin and let you modify hosts and paths as needed. Host and
path rewrites are at the route level, letting you define what specific requests
are rewritten based on any matcher, including path, query parameter, and request
header.
For more details, see the API specification for
RouteAction.UrlRewrite .
Following are three ways to rewrite a request:
Field
Description
urlRewrite.pathPrefixRewrite
Rewrites the path, removing the prefix specified in the
prefixMatch that matched the request.
Only one of pathPrefixRewrite or pathTemplateRewrite
can be specified in a single route rule.
urlRewrite.pathTemplateRewrite
pathTemplateRewrite can only be used with a
corresponding pathTemplateMatch match rule on the same route.
Only one of pathPrefixRewrite or pathTemplateRewrite
can be specified in a single route rule.
urlRewrite.hostRewrite
Rewrites the host before the request is sent to the origin server.
Notes:
Rewritten URLs don't change the cache key. The cache key is based on
the request URL sent by the client.
Rewriting occurs after route matching and signed request validation. Routes
aren't re-matched against another match rule.
Example: Remove a path prefix
For example, to rewrite a client request URL from /vod/videos/hls/1234/abc.ts to
/videos/hls/1234/abc.ts (removing /vod from the path), you can use the
pathPrefixRewrite feature:
name : prod-service
routing :
hostRules :
- hosts :
- cdn.example.com
pathMatcher : example_routes
pathMatchers :
- name : example_routes
routeRules :
- priority : 1
origin : my-origin
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : "/vod/videos/"
routeAction :
urlRewrite :
pathPrefixRewrite : "/videos/"
A pathPrefixRewrite works by replacing the entire path prefix matched in
the matchRules[].prefixMatch with the value of pathPrefixRewrite .
To rewrite a hostname (for example, rewriting cdn.example.com to
my-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com ), you can configure the following:
name : prod-service
routing :
hostRules :
- hosts :
- cdn.example.com
pathMatcher : example_routes
pathMatchers :
- name : example_routes
routeRules :
- priority : 1
origin : my-origin
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : "/videos/"
routeAction :
urlRewrite :
hostRewrite : "my-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
In this case, the origin request URL would change from
cdn.example.com/videos/* to my-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/videos/* .
You can also combine both host and path rewrites within a single route.
Example: Use variables to rewrite URLs
To use pathTemplateMatch and pathTemplateRewrite to rewrite parts of an
incoming request URL, see the capturing variables
section.
Redirect requests
Media CDN supports three types of redirects:
Host redirects, which redirect only the host (domain), keeping the path and
query parameters unchanged.
Path redirects, which replace the path in full.
Path prefix redirects, which only replace the matching prefix.
Redirects default to HTTP 301 (Moved Permanently) , but can be configured to
return different redirect status codes on a per-route basis.
The following configuration is an example of a prefix-based redirect,
where you redirect users visiting https://cdn.example.com/on-demand/* to
https://cdn.example.com/streaming/* .
name : prod-service
routing :
hostRules :
- hosts :
- cdn.example.com
pathMatcher : example_routes
pathMatchers :
- name : example_routes
routeRules :
- priority : 10
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : "/on-demand/"
urlRedirect :
# The prefix matched in matchRules.prefixMatch is replaced
# by this value
prefixRedirect : "/streaming/"
redirectResponseCode : TEMPORARY_REDIRECT # corresponds to a HTTP 307
This example also changes the redirect to a temporary redirect, which prevents
clients (such as browsers) from caching it. This can be useful if you expect to
change it in the near future.
The supported redirectResponseCode values are shown in the following table.
Redirect response code
HTTP status code
MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT
HTTP 301 (Moved Permanently)
FOUND
HTTP 302 (Found)
SEE_OTHER
HTTP 303 (See Other)
TEMPORARY_REDIRECT
HTTP 307 (Temporary Redirect)
PERMANENT_REDIRECT
HTTP 308 (Permanent Redirect)
Notes:
A route can either direct traffic to an origin or return a redirect to the
client. You can't set both the origin and urlRedirect
fields at the same time.
Routes that redirect to HTTPS require that at least one
SSL certificate is attached to the
service.
For more details, see the API specification for
RouteRule.UrlRedirect .
Redirect all requests to HTTPS
To redirect all requests to HTTPS (instead of HTTP), you can configure each of
your services to redirect all client requests to HTTPS automatically. Clients
connecting over HTTP are sent an HTTP 301 (Permanent Redirect) status code with the
Location header set to the same URL by using "https://" instead of "http://".
gcloud
gcloud edge-cache services update MY_SERVICE \
--require-tls
Request issued for: [ MY_SERVICE ]
Updated service [ MY_SERVICE ].
The command returns a description of your service, with requireTls now set
to true .
name : MY_SERVICE
requireTls : true
Note: This overrides per-route
pathMatcher[].routeRules[].routeAction.urlRedirect.httpsRedirect settings.
All traffic is redirected to HTTP/HTTPS with an HTTP 301 (Permanent Redirect)
status code.
You can also choose to set the
Strict-Transport-Security
header as a response header to direct clients to always connect directly over
HTTPS.
Use third-party storage backends
Media CDN supports connecting to publicly reachable HTTP
endpoints outside of Google Cloud, including AWS S3 storage buckets, Azure
Blob Storage, and other storage providers. This can be useful if you have a
multicloud architecture, or are yet to migrate data to Cloud Storage
using the Storage Transfer Service .
A minimal origin configuration that configures a
virtual-hosted bucket
in AWS S3:
name : MY_S3_ORIGIN
originAddress : BUCKET-NAME.s3.REGION.amazonaws.com
If you aren't using a bucket name that matches the hostnames configured for your
EdgeCacheService resources, you must also configure a host rewrite for routes
associated with this origin (or origins). Otherwise, the Host header set by the
client request is used when fetching from the origin.
For example, to map all requests with a path prefix of /legacy/ to your
external bucket, you can configure both a hostRewrite and a
pathPrefixRewrite to strip this prefix from the origin request:
routeRules :
- description : legacy backend
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : "/legacy/"
routeAction :
urlRewrite :
hostRewrite : BUCKET-NAME.s3.REGION.amazonaws.com
pathPrefixRewrite : /
cdnPolicy :
cacheMode : CACHE_ALL_STATIC
defaultTtl : 3600s
For more information about how the host header is set on origin requests, see
the origin request headers
documentation.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS) is a browser-centric approach to securely making cross-origin requests.
CORS policies allow you to automatically set CORS headers, such as
Access-Control-Allow-Origins , based on a per-route policy.
Configure CORS
Media CDN lets you define a CORS policy on a route for an
EdgeCacheService .
A CORS policy defines these rules with a common set of HTTP headers. You can
set common CORS headers in responses, such as
Access-Control-Allow-Origin , Access-Control-Max-Age ,
and Access-Control-Allow-Headers . These headers allow you to make
cross-origin calls to your Media CDN services that might be
hosted on a different domain (origin) from your website's frontend and might
prevent cross-origin requests that you don't explicitly permit.
For example, player.example.com and api.example.com are different origins
(in the browser sense), and you might want to have your frontend application
make requests to api.example.com to fetch the next playlist or refresh a
listing of related content. Similarly, player.example.com might need to
reach out to cdn.example.com to fetch video playlists and video segments:
cdn.example.com needs to indicate that this is OK, and that
player.example.com is an allowed origin , as well as any other rules
(allowed headers, whether cookies can be included).
To take another example, if you want to allow stream.example.com as an origin
and a X-Client-ID header in CORS requests, you can configure a corsPolicy on a
route, as follows:
corsPolicy: maxAge: 600 allowOrigins : [ "stream.example.com" ] allowHeaders :
[ "X-Client-ID" ]
A corsPolicy is configured at
routing.pathMatchers[].routeRules[].routeAction.corsPolicy within an
EdgeCacheService. Each routeRule can define a different corsPolicy as
needed, or none at all.
Important: HTTP OPTIONS requests that match a route with a CORS policy
configured are served directly from Media CDN and don't need to
be sent to the origin. This reduces the number of requests sent to the origin
and improves the off-load rate.
If you define a corsPolicy value and also set a custom response header by
using the responseHeadersToAdd fields on a route with the same name, the
custom response header takes precedence over, and is used instead of, the
corsPolicy value.
If the origin response sets HTTP headers, and you have a corsPolicy value
set, the corsPolicy values are used instead. The values are not collapsed
or combined to avoid sending invalid header values to a client, or
unintentionally setting a more permissive policy than intended.
The special {origin_request_header} is populated with the Origin HTTP header
in the client request. This can be set as a custom response header value on a
route, for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.
For more details, see the API
specification for
RouteAction.CORSPolicy .
CORS policy fields
The following table describes the fields that a CORS policy contains.
Field
Description
Example
allowOrigins
Sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origins response header,
which specifies which origins can make cross-origin requests in a
browser environment.
For example, if your video content is served from
https://video.example.com but your user-facing portal is
served from https://stream.example.com , you would add
https://stream.example.com as an allowed origin.
Access-Control-Allow-Origins: https://stream.example.com
maxAge
Sets the Access-Control-Max-Age response header, which
specifies how long, in seconds, a browser client should cache the
response to a CORS pre-flight request.
Some browsers cap this to 2 hours or less, even if
the maximum value (86400s) is specified.
Access-Control-Max-Age: 7200
allowMethods
Sets the Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header,
which specifies which HTTP methods are allowed to access the
resource.
By default, Media CDN supports only the GET ,
HEAD , and OPTIONS methods.
To configure support for other methods, see
Route methods .
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, OPTIONS, HEAD
allowHeaders
Sets the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header, which
determines which headers can be sent in a CORS request.
This is often required by video players, which need to access some
response headers for video content when requesting it cross-origin.
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, If-Modified-Since,
Range, User-Agent
exposeHeaders
Sets the Access-Control-Expose-Headers response header,
which determines which headers can be accessed by client-side
JavaScript.
This is often required by video players, which might need to access
specific response headers for video content when requesting content
cross-origin.
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Date, Cache-Status, Content-Type,
Content-Length
allowCredentials
Sets the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials response header,
which allows client-side JavaScript to inspect the response for requests
with credentials included.
This header is omitted when set to false.
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
disabled
Disables the corsPolicy without removing it. Pre-flight
OPTIONS requests are proxied to the origin.
N/A
Example corsPolicy
The following configuration example shows a basic corsPolicy configuration:
routeRules :
- priority : 1
matchRules :
- prefixMatch : /stream/
routeAction :
cdnPolicy :
defaultTtl : 3600s
corsPolicy :
allowOrigins :
- "https://stream.example.com"
- "https://stream-staging.example.com"
maxAge : 86400s # some browsers might only honor up to 7200s or less
allowMethods :
- "GET"
- "HEAD"
- "OPTIONS"
allowHeaders :
- "Content-Type"
- "If-Modified-Since"
- "Range"
- "User-Agent"
exposeHeaders :
- "Content-Type"
- "Content-Length"
- "Date"
Troubleshoot routing
If some requests don't retrieve matching results or return errors, check the
following:
A route must have a matchRule with exactly one of prefixMatch ,
fullPathMatch , or pathTemplateMatch defined. The API returns an error if
you don't include one of those fields.
Ensure that the priority of each route is set correctly: more specific
(longer) routes should be given a higher priority over shorter, broader
route matches.
By default, only GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS requests are supported.
To configure support for other methods, see
Route methods .
The methods that are not enabled for a particular route are rejected with
an HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed) error.
HTTP GET requests with a body, or any request with trailers, are rejected
with an HTTP 400 error, because request bodies are not allowed in GET
requests.
Query parameter and header matching are logical "AND"—the request must
match all of the query parameter or header keys (and values, if specified)
to match the given route.
