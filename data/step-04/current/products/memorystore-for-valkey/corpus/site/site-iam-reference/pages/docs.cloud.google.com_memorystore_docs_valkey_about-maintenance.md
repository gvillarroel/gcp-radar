This page explains how Memorystore for Valkey performs maintenance on instances. It also provides information and configuration recommendations that your client applications must be aware of to take advantage of
Memorystore for Valkey's zero downtime maintenance design. These recommendations apply to both highly available instances and instances without replicas. However, for all production use cases, we strongly recommend that you use the high-availability configuration.
Memorystore for Valkey updates instances routinely to ensure that the service is reliable, performant, secure, and up-to-date. These updates are called maintenance . Maintenance is managed fully by the service and is designed to have a zero downtime impact.
Maintenance typically falls into the following categories:
Memorystore features. To launch some features, Memorystore requires a maintenance update.
Operating system patches. We monitor newly identified security vulnerabilities in the operating system continuously. Upon discovery, we patch the operating system to protect you from new risks.
Database patches. Maintenance can include a Valkey update to improve an instance's security, performance, and reliability. This is beyond what OSS Valkey provides.
Configure your client application
To configure your client application for the best performance and availability during maintenance, follow these steps:
Use and configure your third-party client according to the guidance at Valkey client best practices to make sure that any scheduled maintenance doesn't impact the client application. Our recommended client configurations can avoid connection resets through periodic inline topology refreshes and background connection rotations.
Test your client application with a series of update operations (such as scale in or out, or replica count changes) while running a representative workload on primary and replica nodes, and monitoring for client impact. These updates test the inline topology refresh logic on clients, full sync impact, new node discovery, and existing node removal capability. Testing helps make sure that the third-party client is configured correctly to avoid any negative impact to your application.
Scheduled maintenance
Memorystore for Valkey leverages a gradual deployment and create-before-destroy
lifecycle strategy to avoid any
downtime impact of Memorystore scheduled maintenance on your
Valkey instances. Memorystore for Valkey achieves zero-downtime maintenance by
using the request redirection capabilities of the OSS Valkey instance protocol
with the following Memorystore mechanisms:
A coordinated failover without any loss of data.
A graceful node removal to enable clients to catch up to the node topology
updates without any availability impact.
The instance's Private Service Connect endpoints, which aren't
affected by maintenance. For more information about these endpoints, see
Instance endpoints .
The service behavior described in the following sections apply to scheduled
maintenance only. For more information about the impact of unplanned events
such as hardware failures, see Client behavior during an unplanned failover .
Default maintenance windows
By default, Memorystore updates your instance in the following
windows according to your instance's time zone:
Weekday window (Monday to Friday): 10 PM to 6 AM
Weekend window: Friday, 10 PM to Monday, 6 AM
Gradual deployment strategy
Memorystore for Valkey performs deployments with a progressively increasing
scope, and at a rate that allows for failure detection early enough to mitigate
any impact and establish stability confidence. Bake times (the time during which
the update is applied and monitored before considering it a success and moving
forward) are integrated across the Memorystore fleet of instances
at the service scale. Additionally, bake times are integrated within instances
across zones in a region (multiple fault-domains) to reduce the scope of impact,
if any.
For your instance configured for high availability , at most, Memorystore for Valkey updates one fault-domain or zone at
any time to make sure that an instance shard, including both primary and
replicas, has high availability throughout the update. Furthermore,
Memorystore for Valkey updates only a few nodes at any time. Updates use a
create-before-destroy lifecycle mechanism to maximize an instance's stability.
This strategy provides the most benefits when updating an instance with many
shards. Only applying the updates to a small part of the overall user keyspace
at any time maximizes data availability.
Create-before-destroy lifecycle strategy
A Valkey instance has multiple shards. Each shard has one primary node and zero-or-more replica nodes. Memorystore uses the following process to update any existing primary or replica Valkey node in a shard:
Memorystore for Valkey adds a new replica with the latest software update to the shard. Memorystore creates a new node, instead of updating an existing node, to ensure your provisioned capacity is retained if an unexpected bootstrap failure occurs.
If a node within the shard to be updated is a primary node, then the primary node is first converted to a replica before removing the node by using a coordinated failover .
Memorystore removes the replica that uses the earlier software.
For each node in the instance, Memorystore repeats this process.
The create-before-destroy strategy helps retain the provisioned capacity of the instance, as compared to a typical rolling deployment which updates in-place, but results in an availability outage (and sometimes data loss) for the client application. For shards without replicas, Memorystore for Valkey still provisions a new replica first, coordinates the failover, and lastly replaces the existing primary node of the shard.
Step 1: Add a replica
The first step of the create-before-destroy mechanism is to add a replica node
with the latest software using the full sync OSS Valkey mechanism to copy the
data from the primary to the replica node. This is done by forking a child
process and leveraging diskless replication to bootstrap the replica.
Memorystore for Valkey supports diskless replication. Unless you enable
persistence ,
Memorystore for Valkey doesn't use disks during replication.
You can best take advantage of the horizontal scale architecture of the instance by provisioning a higher number of shards to reduce the keyspace size within a node. Having a smaller dataset per node helps to reduce the fork latency impact of a full sync operation. It also speeds up copying of data across the nodes.
Step 2: Run a coordinated primary failover
If the Valkey node that needs to be updated is a primary node, Memorystore runs a coordinated failover to the newly added replica node. Then, Memorystore removes the node . During the coordinated failover, the client and the Valkey nodes work together and use the following strategies to avoid downtime for the application:
Incoming client requests are temporarily blocked on the primary node, providing a window to ensure the existing replica is synced 100% with the primary node.
The replica completes the election process to take over the primary role.
The previous primary node, now a replica node, unblocks the existing requests and redirects the requests to the new primary node by using the OSS Valkey instance protocol. Any new requests sent to the previous replica node continue to be redirected to the new primary node.
Your Valkey-friendly client refreshes its in-memory topology. It learns the address of the new primary endpoint, and no longer requires redirections.
Coordinated failovers typically take tens of milliseconds. However, in-flight data pending to be flushed to replicas and your total instance size can increase failover latency. Instance size can affect the convergence across primary nodes, which affects decision making on electing the new primary node.
Step 3: Remove the replica
The last step of the create-before-destroy mechanism is to remove the replica node on the earlier software. An abrupt node removal would be impactful for client applications because clients cache the endpoint information and the instance topology. Memorystore for Valkey has designed the removal of a Valkey replica to be graceful to allow client applications to refresh their topology before experiencing a hard node shutdown. The topology is customized to enable clients to learn about the new replica but also forget the one to be removed ahead of time.
The replica node running the earlier software is kept around for a certain drain period, typically on the order of minutes, during which it starts redirecting the incoming read requests to the primary node of its shard. It lets the third-party client refresh the node topology and learn about the new replica endpoints. If the client tries to reach a removed node after the drain period, then the attempt fails. This triggers a node topology refresh on the connecting client so that it learns about the replica change. New refreshes of the node topology don't see the replica node to be removed.
Maintenance settings
Memorystore for Valkey lets you customize maintenance schedules to
align with your application's needs and to minimize disruptions. To customize a
maintenance schedule, configure a maintenance window for your instance.
You set maintenance windows for each Memorystore for Valkey instance
and you have the following configuration options:
Day of the week : the day when maintenance occurs
Start hour : the hour that maintenance begins
The maintenance window lasts for one hour. In some cases, maintenance might
extend beyond the window you select.
After you configure a maintenance window for an instance, Memorystore for Valkey
schedules automatic maintenance in the future according to the preferences that
you set for maintenance windows.
Default maintenance windows
If you don't set a maintenance window, then Memorystore for Valkey
updates your instance in one of the following windows, according to your
instance's time zone:
Weekday window (Monday to Friday) : 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM
Weekend window : Friday, 10:00 PM to Monday, 6:00 AM
Maintenance example
As a developer managing a shopping cart service at a retailer, you oversee a
production environment that includes a Memorystore for Valkey instance.
To ensure optimal performance during maintenance, you schedule it when the instance experiences minimal traffic. This typically occurs around midnight on Sundays.
In this case, set your production instance's maintenance window to the following
day and time:
Day of the week : Sunday
Start hour : 1 AM
Upcoming maintenance notifications
To ensure that you stay informed about maintenance events on your instance, set
up email notifications about upcoming maintenance at least one week before
maintenance is scheduled. These notifications have the subject line of "Upcoming
maintenance for your Cloud Memorystore instance [your-instance-name]" .
Memorystore for Valkey also sends a notification when maintenance starts
for your instance. The subject line of the email is "Maintenance
is undergoing for your Cloud Memorystore instance [your-instance-name]" .
After Memorystore for Valkey completes maintenance, it sends a completed
notification. The subject line of the email is "Completed Maintenance
for your Cloud Memorystore instance [your-instance-name]" .
If Memorystore for Valkey reschedules maintenance, then you receive an email that notifies you of the canceled maintenance. The subject line of this email is "Canceled maintenance for your Cloud Memorystore instance [your-instance-name]" .
To receive maintenance notifications you must opt in for them. To sign up for
maintenance notifications, do the following:

To receive maintenance notifications from Memorystore for Valkey,
complete these steps at least one week before the scheduled maintenance update
for your instance. Otherwise, Memorystore for Valkey doesn't have
sufficient time to notify you of the upcoming maintenance.
Memorystore for Valkey sends notifications to the email address that's
associated with your Google Account. You can't configure a custom email alias
(for example, a team email alias). Also, we don't support sending notifications
to a different email address.
By subscribing to maintenance notifications, you receive alerts for all Memorystore for Valkey instances that have maintenance scheduled within
a Google Cloud project. For each instance, you receive a separate notification.
For more information about finding a scheduled maintenance, see Find scheduled maintenance .
Reschedule maintenance
This section provides guidelines on how to reschedule maintenance. For example,
if a new service is scheduled to launch during your current maintenance window,
then you might want to postpone the maintenance window until a few days after
the launch.
You can reschedule maintenance within 14 days of the originally scheduled time.
As part of rescheduling maintenance , choose one of the following options:
Update now : instead of waiting for the scheduled maintenance window,
you can apply the updates to your instance immediately.
Custom day and time : choose any time within 14 days of the
originally scheduled maintenance time.
When you reschedule maintenance, the following restrictions apply:
If there's less than one hour remaining before the current scheduled
maintenance time, then you can't reschedule the maintenance.
After you reschedule the maintenance successfully, Memorystore for Valkey
sends you an email notification, confirming the cancellation of the previous
maintenance. In addition, you receive a new maintenance notification with the
updated schedule.
For more information about rescheduling maintenance see Reschedule maintenance .
Caution: Although Memorystore for Valkey doesn't provide you with the
option to reschedule maintenance for multiple instances at once, you can
reschedule maintenance in bulk programmatically.
If you reschedule in bulk, then batch your operations into
appropriate-sized requests. We recommend that you limit the batch size to
100 instances and wait for ample time between requests. Otherwise, you might
have failed rescheduling events.
