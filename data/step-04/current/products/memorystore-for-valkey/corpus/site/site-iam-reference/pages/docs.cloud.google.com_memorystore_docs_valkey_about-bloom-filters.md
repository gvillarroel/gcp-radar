A Bloom filter is a
space-efficient, probabilistic data structure that you can use to test whether
an element is a member of a set. With this type of structure, you can have false
positives. For example, the filter can indicate that an element is in the set,
even though it isn't. However, you can't have false negatives. So, if you add an
element to the set, then the filter must indicate that the element is in the
set.
The filter achieves this by using multiple hash functions to map an element to
several bits in a fixed-size bit array. To control the probability of false
positives, you can adjust the number of bits in the array and the number of hash
functions used.
Use cases
This section describes the following use cases for using Bloom filters:
Deduplicate advertisements and events : If you have an ecommerce site,
streaming service, advertising network, or marketing platform, then Bloom
filters can help you determine whether a user saw an advertisement, received a
promotional email or notification, or purchased a product.
You can use a Bloom filter to store all of the products that a user purchases.
If a product isn't in the filter, then show the ad to the user and add the
product to the filter.
If the product is in the filter, then the user probably saw the associated
advertisement and purchased the product. Therefore, find a different ad to
show to the user.
Detect fraud : You can use Bloom filters to detect whether a credit card is
flagged as stolen. To do this, use a filter that contains cards reported as
stolen. When a card is used, check whether it appears in the filter.
If the card isn't in the filter, then it isn't marked as stolen.
If the card is in the filter, then you can check the card against the main
database or deny the purchase.
Filter spam and harmful content : You can use Bloom filters to screen
content for potential threats, harmful materials, and spam. To do this, create a
filter that contains malicious URLs, spam email addresses, and spam phone
numbers. When the user inputs a URL, or receives an email or text, check whether
this information appears in the filter.
If the URL, email, or text isn't in the filter, then allow the user to
access the site represented by the URL, or receive the email or text.
If the URL, email, or text is in the filter, then deny the user access to
the associated site or prevent the user from receiving the email or text.
Detect duplicate usernames : You can use Bloom filters to determine whether
a username is new or if it already exists. To do this, use a filter to track
every username that signs up for your ecommerce site or streaming service. When
a new user attempts to sign up with their username, check whether the username
appears in the filter.
If the username isn't in the filter, then create the account and add the
username to the filter.
If the username is in the filter, then reject the username.
For more information about these use cases, see Common use cases for Bloom filters .
Availability
If you create a Memorystore for Valkey instance, version 8.0 and later, then version
1.0 of the Bloom data type and associated commands
is available automatically. This data type is API-compatible with the Bloom
filter command syntax of the following Valkey client libraries:
valkey-py
valkey-java
valkey-go
Note: The Bloom data type isn't RDB-compatible with other non-Valkey-based
Bloom offerings.
Bloom filter types
You can have the following types of Bloom filters:
Scaling : This type of filter doesn't have a fixed capacity so the filter
can grow. If the filter reaches its capacity and you add a new, unique item to
the filter, then the filter scales out and a new subfilter is created. This
subfilter has a larger capacity than the filter.
Non-scaling : This type of filter has a fixed capacity so there's a limit
to how many items you can add to the filter. If the filter reaches its capacity
and you attempt to add a new, unique item to the filter, then you receive an
error.
For more information about the differences between these types of Bloom filters,
see Scaling and non-scaling Bloom filters .
Bloom filter properties
A Bloom filter has the following properties:
Capacity : The number of items that a Bloom filter can hold before either
the filter scales out (for a scaling filter ) or it
rejects adding additional items (for a non-scaling filter ).
False positive rate : The rate that controls the probability of operations
for Bloom filters resulting in false positives. For example, an operation that
you use to check whether an element is in the filter indicates that the element
is in the filter, even though it isn't.
Expansion : This property is associated with scaling Bloom filters. It
controls the growth in overall capacity when the filter scales out because the
filter reaches its capacity.
Scaling or non-scaling : Whether a Bloom filter is a scaling or non-scaling
filter.
For more information about the properties of Bloom filters, see Bloom properties .
Bloom filter objects
A Bloom filter object can consume a maximum of 128 MB of memory. To check how
much memory a Bloom filter consumes, use the BF.INFO key SIZE command, where key is the key name for the filter and
SIZE is the number of bytes that the filter consumes.
Bloom categories
To manage access to Bloom commands and data, use the @bloom
category. In addition to this category, the following categories use Bloom
commands: @read , @write , and @fast .
The following table indicates whether you can map Bloom commands to the @read ,
@write , @fast , and @bloom categories.

Bloom commands
This section lists and describes the Bloom commands that you can use to perform
Bloom operations on the Bloom data type.
Command
Description
BF.ADD
Add a single item to a Bloom filter. If the filter doesn't exist, then
the command creates it.
BF.CARD
Return the cardinality of a Bloom filter.
BF.EXISTS
Determine if a Bloom filter contains the item that you specify.
BF.INFO
Return usage information and properties of a Bloom filter.
BF.INSERT
Create a Bloom filter with 0 or more items or add items to an existing
filter.
BF.MADD
Add one or more items to a Bloom filter. If the filter doesn't exist,
then the command creates it.
BF.MEXISTS
Determine if the bloom filter contains one or more items.
BF.RESERVE
Create an empty bloom filter with the properties that you specify.
Note : For more information about using these
commands, see the Valkey command
reference page. Memorystore for Valkey doesn't support the BF.LOAD command.
You can check the performance of using these commands. For more information,
see Performance .
Check Bloom filters
You can check the following information about Bloom filters:
Memory usage : check if a filter reaches its memory usage limit. To check
the amount of memory that a filter uses, use the BF.INFO
command.
Capacity : check if a filter is a scaling filter. If it is, scale the
filter so that it reaches its capacity, and then scale out.
For more information about checking the memory usage and capacity for Bloom
filters, see Handle large Bloom filters .
