About cross-region replication
Stay organized with collections

This page provides an overview of cross-region replication for Memorystore for Valkey.
For instructions on managing cross-region replication, see Work with cross-region replication .
Cross-region replication lets you create secondary instances from a primary
instance to make your instance available for reads in different regions.
Secondary instances also provide redundancy for disaster recovery scenarios
in case of regional outages.
Key concepts in this page include the following:
Primary instance : A read-write instance in a single region.
Secondary instance : A read-only instance that replicates from the
primary instance asynchronously. For information about promoting and detaching
secondary instances, see the detach and switchover tasks that appear in
How to manage cross-region replication .
Replicator node : A node in the primary instance's shard that replicates
to a follower node in the secondary instance. Any primary or replica node in the
shard can serve the role of a replicator.
Follower nodes : Nodes in the secondary instance that replicate from a
replicator node in the primary instance. Only primary nodes in the secondary
instance can have the role of a follower.
Shard count and slot assignment : Primary and secondary instances have
the same number of shards and slot assignments.
Benefits
Benefits of cross-region replication on Memorystore for Valkey include the
following:
Disaster recovery : If the primary instance's region becomes unavailable,
then you can detach or switch over to a secondary instance in another region to
serve read and write requests. Secondary instances serve read requests without
issuing a switchover or detach command.
Geographically distributed data : Distributing data geographically brings
the data closer to you and decreases read latency.
Geographic load balancing for read traffic : If slow or overloaded
connections occur in one region, then you can route traffic to another region.
Feature behavior
This section explains important behavior for the cross-region replication
feature.
Scale the instance capacity : When you scale the capacity of the primary instance,
Memorystore for Valkey scales secondary instances automatically to match the
primary instance.
Scale the replica count : You can scale the replica count for primary and secondary instances independently based
on your workload needs. Updates to the replica count are local only and don't
propagate to other instances within the cross-region replication collection of
instances.
Switch over during a potential outage : You can perform a switchover to
promote a secondary instance, even if the primary instance isn't available
because of an outage. When the outage is resolved, the unavailable primary
instance becomes a secondary instance.
Create online secondary instances : When adding a secondary instance to
a primary instance, the primary instance stays online. While
Memorystore for Valkey creates the secondary instance, the primary instance
handles requests and replicates data.
Create secondary instances : You can have up to two secondary instances.
They can be located either in the same region or in different regions from
each other. You can't make an existing instance into a secondary instance. You
can add only new instances as secondary instances.
Synchronize settings : Memorystore for Valkey synchronizes most instance
settings automatically between primary and secondary instances. For more
information about these settings, see Instance settings .
Pricing : Memorystore for Valkey charges customers that use cross-region
replication for any secondary instances that Memorystore for Valkey provisions
for cross-region replication. For each node and replica that
Memorystore for Valkey deploys on the secondary instance, you're charged as
per any other primary instance. Additionally, you incur networking charges for transferring data between
instances in different regions.
Perform maintenance updates : To ensure compatibility with cross-region
replication, while creating your secondary instance, your primary instance
might undergo a maintenance update. If the primary instance isn't running the
required software version, then this update happens. The update process might
introduce some additional latency when creating your secondary instance. For
more information, see About maintenance .
How to manage cross-region replication
Cross-region replication involves the following tasks:
Create a secondary instance : create a
secondary instance that replicates data from your primary instance
continuously.
View the secondary instance : view information
about the secondary instance, including the name of the primary instance and
the other secondary instance in the replication group.
Detach secondary instances : detaching
secondary instances is an operation in which you decouple secondary instances
from their primary instance. This makes them fully functional, independent
instances that allow both reads and writes. After a detach operation, the
secondary instances no longer replicate data from the primary instance with
which they were associated formerly. Both the original primary instance and
the newly detached instances (former secondaries) function as independent
instances with no relationship to one another.
You detach secondary instances for the following reasons:
Regional migration : perform a planned migration of
Memorystore for Valkey resources from their primary region to another
region.
Disaster recovery : activate Memorystore for Valkey resources in a
secondary region rapidly if the resources in the primary region become
unavailable. If the secondary instances aren't caught up to the primary
instance fully, then some data loss might occur.
Switch over your instances : perform a switchover
to reverse the roles of your primary and secondary instances. You can perform
a switchover for the following reasons:
Test your disaster recovery setup
Switch over during an actual disaster recovery scenario
Perform a migration of your workload
After you complete the switchover, Memorystore for Valkey reverses the
direction of replication. The former secondary instance can now accept both
reads and writes, while the former primary instance switches to read-only.
Architecture example for cross-region replication
This diagram shows a primary instance in the us-east1 region and secondary
instances in the us-west1 and asia-east1 regions. The direction of
replication is always from the primary instance to the secondary instances (for
this example, from the us-east1 region to the other regions).
Even though this diagram shows the same number of replicas in all regions,
cross-region replication lets you have varying numbers of replicas according
to your requirements.
Instance settings
This section explains the settings that are required, copied, and overridden for
primary and secondary instances that use cross-region replication. It also
explains the settings that you configure on the primary instance, and the
settings that you configure locally.
Required parameters to create a secondary instance
To create a secondary instance , you must set
values for the following parameters:
Google Cloud project : the project where your primary instance is located
and where you create the secondary instance.
Region : the region where you want the secondary instance to be located.
Private Service Connect configuration : the network setup for the secondary instance.
Primary instance : when you create the secondary instance, you must
indicate a primary instance. You can use any instance other than a secondary
instance as a primary instance. If you don't have a primary instance, then create it .
Settings that a secondary instance copies from the primary instance
When you create a secondary instance, this instance copies the following
settings from the primary instance:
Shard count
IAM authentication mode
In-transit encryption mode
Instance configurations
Valkey version
Node type
Persistence mode
Cluster Mode Enabled and Cluster Mode Disabled modes
Override default settings
When you create a secondary instance, you can use the following settings to
override the default settings:
Zone distribution configuration
Replica count
Maintenance windows
Deletion protection
Automated backups
Update instance settings
When you update the settings for your Memorystore for Valkey instance, you can
change some settings only on the primary instance. Memorystore for Valkey syncs
these changes to the secondary instances automatically.
You can change other settings on the primary and secondary instances
independently. Memorystore for Valkey applies these changes only locally, and
doesn't sync them with the other instances.
Configure settings on the primary instance
You must change the following settings on the primary instance.
Memorystore for Valkey syncs these changes with the secondary instances
automatically.
Shard count
Instance configurations
Persistence mode
Valkey version
Node type
Configure local settings
You configure the following settings locally:
Deletion protection
Replica count
Maintenance windows
Instance endpoints
Automated backups
Best practices for switching primary and secondary instances
When you perform a switchover , we recommend that
you follow the instructions in this section. This way, your application can keep
track of writes and send any writes to the appropriate instance.
Stop your application from writing to the primary instance.
If there are multiple secondary instances to promote, then determine the
secondary instance that you want to promote to the primary instance. The
following factors can help you determine which secondary instance to promote:
How close your application is to the instance. This can affect write
latency.
The secondary instance that's most caught up, in terms of data.
The secondary instance that's closest to the primary instance, in terms of settings .
Perform a switchover on the secondary instance .
Wait for the switchover operation to complete.
Update your application to send any writes to the newly promoted instance
that you selected in step 2.
