JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) provides an efficient way for you to store and
manipulate structured data in Memorystore for Valkey. Using JSON provides you with the
following benefits:
Having fast search and filtering capabilities
Performing in-place updates to JSON data without having to overwrite entire
documents
Querying, modifying, and managing complex data structures efficiently
If your applications require dynamic and flexible data storage, then JSON is
ideal for you. Also, by using JSON, you can encode complex datasets inside of
Memorystore for Valkey instances without using schemas. You can store, access,
and update data in the instances, and you don't have to manage custom code to
serialize and deserialize the data.
A JSON document is a human-readable text format for storing and transporting
data. This format consists of key-value pairs and structured data types. The
JSON format lets you retrieve and update portions of a JSON document without
having to manipulate the entire object. This can improve your performance and
reduce your costs. In addition, the JSON format is compliant with RFC 7159 , the ECMA-404
JSON data interchange standard, and UTF-8 Unicode
in JSON text.
Availability
If you create a Memorystore for Valkey instance, version 8.0 and later, then
version 1.0 of the JSON data type and associated commands
is available automatically. This data type is API-compatible with version 2 of
the JSON module. Also, as of RFC 7159, the root element of a JSON document can
be of any JSON data type.
JSON properties
JSON has the following properties:
Max document size : to prevent potential out-of-memory issues from
malicious or unbounded insertions, you can configure a limit on the size of
individual JSON keys.
By default, the value for this property is set to 0 , which means that
there's no limit to the size of the JSON document. To set this limit, use the
CONFIG SET json.max-document-size VALUE
command, where VALUE is the maximum size of the document. For example, if
you specify 4123456 , then the maximum document size is 4,123,456 bytes
(4 MB).
To see how much memory is used by a JSON value that's stored in a specified
key, you can use the JSON.DEBUG MEMORY KEY or MEMORY USAGE KEY
commands. For these commands, KEY is the name of the key where the
JSON value is stored.
Max depth : the maximum nesting level for JSON objects and arrays. For more
information, see Maximum nesting depth limit .
JSON document size
Because a JSON document is stored internally in a format that's optimized for
rapid access and modification, this type of document can consume a lot of
memory. To check how much memory a JSON document consumes, use the
JSON.DEBUG MEMORY KEY
command, where KEY is the name of the key that contains the document.
JSON categories
To manage access to JSON commands and data, use the @json
category. In addition to this category, the following categories use JSON
commands: @read , @write , @fast , @slow , and @admin .
The following table indicates whether you can map JSON commands to the @read ,
@write , @fast , @slow , @admin , and @json categories.

JSON commands
This section lists and describes the JSON commands that you can use to perform
operations on JSON documents.
Command
Description
JSON.ARRAPPEND
Append one or more JSON values into the array at the path.
JSON.ARRINDEX
Search for the first occurrence of a scalar JSON value in an array.
JSON.ARRINSERT
Insert one or more JSON values into an array at a path before the
index that you specify.
JSON.ARRLEN
Retrieve the length of the JSON array at the path.
JSON.ARRPOP
Remove and return an element from an index in the array.
JSON.ARRTRIM
Trim an array at the path so that it contains only the inclusive range
of elements that you specify.
JSON.CLEAR
Clear the arrays or a JSON object at a path that you specify.
JSON.DEBUG
Retrieve information about a JSON document. Memorystore for Valkey
supports the following subcommands:
MEMORY : report a value's memory usage in bytes.
DEPTH : report the maximum path depth of a JSON
document.

How Memorystore for Valkey interacts with JSON
This section describes how Memorystore for Valkey interacts with the JSON data
type.
Multiple conditional expressions
If there are multiple conditional expressions for filtering, then
Memorystore for Valkey evaluates them in the following order:
Operations inside of parentheses
The logical AND expression ( && )
The logical OR ( || ) expression
Maximum nesting depth limit
When a JSON object or array has an element that's another JSON object or array,
the inner object or array nests within the outer object or array. The maximum
nesting depth limit is 128. So, a value like $.a.b.c.d... can reach only 128
levels.
If you attempt to create a JSON document that contains a nesting depth greater
than 128, then Memorystore for Valkey rejects the document and you receive an
error. However, you can adjust this limit by using the CONFIG SET json.max-path-limit VALUE command, where
VALUE is the depth limit that you want.
JSON numbers
In JSON, both floating point numbers and integers are called numbers because
they have the same data type. When Memorystore for Valkey receives a JSON
number, it converts the number into one of the following internal binary
representations:
A 64-bit IEEE double precision floating point number
A 64-bit signed integer
JSON doesn't retain the original string and all of its formatting. When
Memorystore for Valkey outputs a number as part of a JSON response,
Memorystore for Valkey converts the number from the internal binary
representation to a printable string that uses generic formatting rules.
When you use the JSON.NUMINCRBY and JSON.NUMMULTBY
commands with JSON numbers, the following conditions apply:
If both numbers are integers and the result is out of the range of int64 ,
then the result becomes a 64-bit IEEE double precision floating point number
automatically.
If at least one of the numbers is a floating point number, then the result is
a 64-bit IEEE double precision floating point number.
If the result exceeds the range of the 64-bit IEEE double precision floating
point number, then you receive an OVERFLOW error message.
Direct arrays
Memorystore for Valkey filters array objects directly. For example, if you have
data such as [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] and a path query such as
$[?(@ , then Memorystore for Valkey returns
[ 0,1,2 ]. For data such as { "my_valkey_key":[0,1,2,3] }
and a path query such as $.my_valkey_key[?(@ ,
Memorystore for Valkey also returns [ 0,1,2 ].
Array indexes
Memorystore for Valkey lets you use positive and negative indexes for arrays.
The following conditions apply to these types of indexes:
Positive index : numbers start at the beginning of the array. For
example, if an array has a positive index of three, then 0 queries the first
element, 1 queries the second element, and 2 queries the third element.
Negative index : numbers start at the end of the array. If an array has a
negative index of three, then -1 queries the third element, -2 queries the
second element, and -3 queries the first element.
Memorystore for Valkey doesn't round indexes up or down. If you have an array
with a length of 3, and you call either a positive index that's greater than 3
or a negative index that's less than -3, then Memorystore for Valkey doesn't
return a result.
Syntax for JSON paths
You can't use invalid syntax for your JSON paths. This condition applies, even
if a subset of a JSON path with an invalid syntax contains a valid path.
