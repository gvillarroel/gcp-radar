Tool: list_backup_collections
List all Memorystore for Valkey backup collections.
The following sample demonstrate how to use curl to invoke the list_backup_collections MCP tool.
Curl Request
curl --location 'https://memorystore.googleapis.com/mcp' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
--data '{
"method": "tools/call",
"params": {
"name": "list_backup_collections",
"arguments": {
// provide these details according to the tool' s MCP specification
}
} ,
"jsonrpc" : "2.0" ,
"id" : 1
} '
Input Schema
Request for ListBackupCollections .
ListBackupCollectionsRequest
JSON representation
{
"parent" : string ,
"pageSize" : integer ,
"pageToken" : string
}
Fields
parent
string
Required. The resource name of the backupCollection location using the form: projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id} where location_id refers to a Google Cloud region.
pageSize
integer
Optional. The maximum number of items to return.
If not specified, a default value of 1000 will be used by the service. Regardless of the page_size value, the response may include a partial list and a caller should only rely on response's next_page_token to determine if there are more clusters left to be queried.
pageToken
string
Optional. The next_page_token value returned from a previous ListBackupCollections request, if any.
Output Schema
Response for ListBackupCollections .
ListBackupCollectionsResponse
JSON representation
{
"backupCollections" : [
{
object ( BackupCollection )
}
] ,
"nextPageToken" : string ,
"unreachable" : [
string
]
}
Fields
backupCollections[]
object ( BackupCollection )
A list of backupCollections in the project.
If the location_id in the parent field of the request is "-", all regions available to the project are queried, and the results aggregated. If in such an aggregated query a location is unavailable, a placeholder backupCollection entry is included in the response with the name field set to a value of the form projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/backupCollections/ - and the status field set to ERROR and status_message field set to "location not available for ListBackupCollections".
nextPageToken
string
Token to retrieve the next page of results, or empty if there are no more results in the list.
unreachable[]
string
Locations that could not be reached.
BackupCollection
JSON representation
{
"name" : string ,
"instanceUid" : string ,
"instance" : string ,
"kmsKey" : string ,
"uid" : string ,
"createTime" : string ,
"totalBackupSizeBytes" : string ,
"totalBackupCount" : string ,
"lastBackupTime" : string
}
Fields
name
string
Identifier. Full resource path of the backup collection.
instanceUid
string
Output only. The instance uid of the backup collection.
instance
string
Output only. The full resource path of the instance the backup collection belongs to. Example: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}
kmsKey
string
Output only. The KMS key used to encrypt the backups under this backup collection.
uid
string
Output only. System assigned unique identifier of the backup collection.
createTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Output only. The time when the backup collection was created.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
totalBackupSizeBytes
string ( int64 format)
Output only. Total size of all backups in the backup collection.
totalBackupCount
string ( int64 format)
Output only. Total number of backups in the backup collection.
lastBackupTime
string ( Timestamp format)
Output only. The last time a backup was created in the backup collection.
Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" , "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30" .
Timestamp
JSON representation
{
"seconds" : string ,
"nanos" : integer
}
Fields
seconds
string ( int64 format)
Represents seconds of UTC time since Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Must be between -62135596800 and 253402300799 inclusive (which corresponds to 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59Z).
nanos
integer
Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution. This field is the nanosecond portion of the duration, not an alternative to seconds. Negative second values with fractions must still have non-negative nanos values that count forward in time. Must be between 0 and 999,999,999 inclusive.
