Setting up a .NET development environment
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial shows how to prepare your local machine for
developing .NET
and .NET Framework
apps that run on Google Cloud and call Google Cloud APIs.
Install a development environment
The recommended development environment for running the .NET tutorials and
sample apps in this documentation is
Visual Studio
or
Visual Studio Code .
Create a Google Cloud project
Create a Google Cloud project
to run your apps. Google Cloud projects form the basis for creating,
enabling, and using all Google Cloud services.
Set up authentication
Your .NET app must authenticate itself to use Google Cloud APIs. You use
Application Default Credentials (ADC) ,
which let you provide credentials for either local development or in a
production environment.
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Authenticate for using client libraries .
For general information about authentication, see
Authentication at Google .
(Optional) Install SDKs
Even though you can create and manage Google Cloud resources using your
web browser using the Google Cloud console ,
if you'd prefer to manage your Google Cloud resources from the
command-line, you can consider installing the
Google Cloud CLI .
The gcloud CLI is a command-line interface for Google Cloud
products and services.
