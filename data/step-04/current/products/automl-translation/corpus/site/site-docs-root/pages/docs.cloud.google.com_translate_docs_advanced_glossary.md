Creating and using glossaries (Advanced)
A glossary is a custom dictionary the Cloud Translation API uses
to consistently translate the customer's domain-specific terminology. This
typically involves specifying how to translate a named entity.
You might use a glossary for the following use cases:
Product names : For example, "Google Home" must translate
to "Google Home".
Ambiguous words : For example, the word "bat" can mean a
piece of sports equipment or an animal. If you know that you are translating
words about sports, you might want to use a glossary to feed the
Cloud Translation API the sports translation of "bat", not the translation
for the animal.
Borrowed words : For example, "bouillabaisse" in French
translates to "bouillabaisse" in English. English borrowed the
word "bouillabaisse" from French in the 19th century. An English speaker
lacking French cultural context might not know that bouillabaisse is a
fish stew dish. Glossaries can override a translation so that
"bouillabaisse" in French translates to "fish stew" in English.
Note: The maximum number of glossaries is listed on the Quotas and
limits page. If you reach this limit, you must
delete existing glossaries to create new ones.
Before you begin
Before you can start using the Cloud Translation API, you must have a project that has
the Cloud Translation API enabled, and you must have the appropriate credentials. You can
also install client libraries for common programming languages to help you make
calls to the API. For more information, see the Setup page.
Required permissions
To work with glossaries, your service account requires glossary-specific
permissions. You can grant a role to your service account by using one of the
pre-defined IAM roles , such as
Cloud Translation API Editor ( roles/cloudtranslate.editor ), or you can create a custom
role that grants the necessary
permissions. You can view all of the Cloud Translation API permissions in the
IAM permissions reference .
Cloud Translation permissions begin with cloudtranslate .
For creating glossaries, you also need permissions to read objects in the
Cloud Storage bucket where your glossary file is located. You can grant
a role to your service account by using one of the pre-defined
IAM roles , such as
Storage Object Viewer ( roles/storage.objectViewer ), or you can create a
custom role that grants permissions to
read objects.
For information on adding an account to a role, see Granting, changing, and
revoking access to
resources .
Create a glossary
The terms in a glossary can be single tokens (words) or short phrases (usually
fewer than five words). The main steps for using a glossary are:
Create a glossary file
Create the glossary resource with our Cloud Translation API
Specify which glossary to use when you request a translation
A project can have multiple glossaries. You can
get a list of the available glossaries and can
delete glossaries that you no longer need.
Stopwords
Cloud Translation ignores some terms that are included in a glossary; these
terms are known as stopwords . When translating stopwords, Cloud Translation
ignores any matching glossary entries. For a list of all stopwords, see
Glossary stopwords .
Creating a glossary file
Fundamentally, a glossary is a text file in which each line contains
corresponding terms in multiple languages. The Cloud Translation API
supports both unidirectional glossaries, which specify the desired translation
for a single pair of source and target languages, and equivalent term sets ,
which identify the equivalent terms in multiple languages.
The total number of terms in a glossary input file can't exceed
10.4 million (10,485,760) UTF-8 bytes for all terms in all the
languages combined. Any single glossary term must be less than
1024 UTF-8 bytes. Terms longer than 1024 bytes are ignored.
By default, glossary matches are case sensitive. When you apply a glossary, you
can ignore case for all entries. If you have a mix of case-sensitive and
case-insensitive terms, use the default behavior and, for case-insensitive
terms, include both forms in your glossary.
Important: We recommend that you keep your glossary files even after you create
a glossary resource. Cloud Translation doesn't support version control on
glossary resources. If you modify a glossary and then need to rollback the
changes, you must use the original glossary file to replace the modified
glossary.
Unidirectional glossaries
The Cloud Translation API accepts TSV, CSV or TMX files.
TSV and CSV
For tab-separated values (TSV) and comma separated values (CSV), each row
contains a pair of terms separated by a tab ( \t ) or comma ( , ). The first
column includes the term in the source language and the second column includes
the term in the target language, as shown in the following example:
Important: Do not include a header row in the TSV or CSV file to identify
the source and target languages. You identify them when you create the
glossary .
Translation Memory eXchange (TMX)
Translation Memory eXchange (TMX) is a standard XML format for providing source
and target translations. The Cloud Translation API supports input files in a format
based on
TMX version 1.4 .
This example illustrates the required structure:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE tmx SYSTEM "tmx14.dtd">
<tmx version="1.4">
<header segtype="sentence" o-tmf="UTF-8"
adminlang="en" srclang="en" datatype="PlainText"/>
<body>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en">
<seg>account</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="es">
<seg>cuenta</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en">
<seg>directions</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="es">
<seg>indicaciones</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
</body>
</tmx>
The <header> element of a well-formed TMX file must identify the source
language using the srclang attribute, and every <tuv> element must identify
the language of the contained text using the xml:lang attribute. You identify
the source and target languages using their ISO-639
codes.
All <tu> elements must contain a pair of <tuv> elements with the same source
and target languages. If a <tu> element contains more than two <tuv>
elements, the Cloud Translation API processes only the first <tuv> matching the
source language and the first matching the target language and ignores the rest.
If a <tu> element does not have a matching pair of <tuv> elements, the
Cloud Translation API skips over the invalid <tu> element.
The Cloud Translation API strips the markup tags from around a <seg> element
before processing it. If a <tuv> element contains more than one <seg>
element, the Cloud Translation API concatenates their text into a single element with a
space between them.
If the file contains XML tags other than those shown above, the Cloud Translation API
ignores them.
If the file does not conform to proper XML and TMX format – for example,
if it is missing an end tag or a <tmx> element – the Cloud Translation API
aborts processing it. The Cloud Translation API also aborts processing if it skips
more than 1024 invalid <tu> elements.
Equivalent term sets (CSV)
For equivalent term sets, Cloud Translation API only accepts files in the CSV format. To
define equivalent term sets, create a multi-column CSV file in which each row
lists a single glossary term in multiple languages.
The first row in the file is a header row identifying the language for each column,
using its ISO-639
or BCP-47
language code. You can also include optional columns for part of speech
( pos ) and a description ( description ). The algorithm does not currently
use pos information, and specific pos values are not validated.
Each subsequent row contains equivalent glossary terms in the languages
identified in the header. You can leave columns blank if the term is not
available in all languages.
Create a glossary resource
After you have the equivalent glossary terms identified, make the glossary file
available to the Cloud Translation API by creating a glossary resource.
Unidirectional glossary
When creating a unidirectional glossary, you must indicate the language pair
( language_pair ), by specifying the source language
( source_language_code ), and the target language
( target_language_code ). The following example uses the REST API and
command line, but you can also use the client
libraries to create a
unidirectional glossary.
REST
When you create a new glossary, you supply a glossary id (a resource name).
For example:
projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/glossaries/my-en-to-ru-glossary
where my-project is the PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID, and my-en-ru-glossary
is the glossary-id provided by you.
Note: project-id works as well, but project-number
is preferred going forward.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID : the numeric or alphanumeric ID of your Google Cloud project
glossary-id : your glossary ID, for example., my_en_ru_glossary
bucket-name : name of bucket where your glossary file is located
glossary-filename : filename of your glossary
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID /locations/us-central1/glossaries
Request JSON body:
{
"name":"projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID /locations/us-central1/glossaries/ glossary-id ",
"languagePair": {
"sourceLanguageCode": "en",
"targetLanguageCode": "ru"
},
"inputConfig": {
"gcsSource": {
"inputUri": "gs:// bucket-name / glossary-filename "
}
}
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID /locations/us-central1/glossaries"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID /locations/us-central1/glossaries" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ project-number /locations/us-central1/operations/ operation-id ",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.translation.v3beta1.CreateGlossaryMetadata",

"state": "RUNNING",
"submitTime": "2019-11-19T19:05:10.650047636Z"
}
}
Equivalent term sets glossary
Once you have the glossary terms identified in your equivalent term set,
make the glossary file available to the Cloud Translation API by creating a glossary
resource.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID : the numeric or alphanumeric ID of your Google Cloud project
glossary-id : your glossary ID
bucket-name : name of bucket where your glossary file is located
glossary-filename : filename of your glossary
HTTP method and URL:

Operation status
Creating a glossary resource is a long-running operation, so it may take a
substantial amount of time to complete. You can poll the status of this
operation to see if it has completed, or you can cancel the operation.
For more information, see
Long-running operations .
Use glossaries
Translate text with a glossary
In Cloud Translation - Advanced, you explicitly specify
which translation model
to use for translating the text. Translation LLM,
NMT, and custom models can be called in combination with
glossary, but only Translation LLM supports the latest quality
enhancement with contextual glossary. To apply this feature, set
BOOLEAN_CONTEXTUAL: to TRUE. You can also identify a glossary to use for
domain-specific terminology.
Note: The specified glossary must be associated with the current Google
Cloud project.
REST
This example translates text using the default NMT model and a glossary.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID : the numeric or alphanumeric ID of your Google Cloud project.
GLOSSARY_ID : Your glossary ID, such as
my-en-ru-glossary .
BOOLEAN : Whether matches are case insensitive. By default this
value is false .
BOOLEAN_CONTEXTUAL : Whether considers context in glossary translation. By default this
value is false .
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID /locations/us-central1:translateText

$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID /locations/us-central1:translateText" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"glossaryTranslations": {
"translatedText": "Доктор Ватсон, пожалуйста, откажитесь от своего мусора. Вы поделились нежелательной электронной почтой со я . Давайте поговорим о спаме и важности рейтинга в конфиденциальном режиме.",
"glossaryConfig": {
"glossary": "projects/ project-number /locations/us-central1/glossaries/ GLOSSARY_ID ",
"ignoreCase": BOOLEAN ,
"contextual_translation_enabled": BOOLEAN_CONTEXTUAL
}
},
"translations": {
"translatedText": "Доктор Ватсон, пожалуйста, откажитесь от своего мусора. Вы поделились нежелательной электронной почтой со мной. Давайте поговорим о спаме и важности рейтинга в конфиденциальном режиме.",
}
}
The translations field contains the regular machine translation before the glossary is applied;
the glossaryTranslations field contains the translation after the glossary is applied.
When you set the contextual_translation_enabled field to true , the response will only contain the glossaryTranslations field and not the translations field.

Adaptive translations with glossary
To use a glossary with an adaptive translation request, include a glossary configuration with your request.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID : the numeric or alphanumeric ID of
your Google Cloud project
LOCATION : The region where your source dataset is located, such
as us-central1 .
DATASET_NAME : The name of the dataset that
Cloud Translation uses to customize your translations, formatted as
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /adaptiveMtDatasets/ DATASET_ID .
You can get dataset names by listing
all datasets in your project.
SOURCE_TEXT : The text to translate.
MIME_TYPE (Optional): The format of the source text, such as
text/html or text/plain . By default, the MIME type
is set to text/plain .
GLOSSARY_ID : Your glossary ID, such as
my-en-ru-glossary .
BOOLEAN (Optional): Whether matches are case insensitive. By default this
value is false .
BOOLEAN_CONTEXTUAL (Optional): Whether to consider context in glossary translation. By default this
value is false .
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION :adaptiveMtTranslate

Update a glossary
You can update a glossary to change its name or replace all of its entries with
a new glossary input file. If you need to rollback changes to the glossary
entries, you must use the original glossary file to replace the modified
glossary.
REST
To update a glossary, send a PATCH request with the
glossary.patch
method. The following example updates an equivalent term set glossary. Use the
list method to find the ID of a particular glossary.
The update_mask query parameter specifies if you're updating the
glossary input file, glossary display name, or both. At least one update mask
parameter is required.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID : the numeric or alphanumeric ID of your Google Cloud project.
LOCATION : The region where the glossary to update is located,
such as us-central1 .
GLOSSARY_ID : The ID of an existing glossary.
LANGUAGE_CODE : The language
code that specifies the languages for this equivalent term set
glossary.
GLOSSARY_FILE_PATH : The location and filename of your glossary
input file.
HTTP method and URL:
PATCH https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID /locations/ LOCATION /glossaries/ GLOSSARY_ID ?update_mask=input_config&update_mask=display_name
Request JSON body:
{
"name":"projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID /locations/ LOCATION /glossaries/ GLOSSARY_ID ",
"languageCodesSet": {
"languageCodes": [" LANGUAGE_CODE ", ...]
},
"inputConfig": {
"gcsSource": {
"inputUri": "gs:// GLOSSARY_FILE_PATH "
}
}
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
