Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model
Google's standard Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has evolved from the
neural network translation system
that Google introduced in November 2016, with many improvements. It can
translate to and from many languages in real time.
Its model ID is general/nmt .
You can access the NMT model without modification through
either the Cloud Translation - Basic API or the Cloud Translation - Advanced API. With
Cloud Translation - Advanced API, you can also
customize it .
In either case, you need to have a
Google Cloud project that
has Cloud Translation API enabled, with credentials to make authenticated
calls. To access the model using Python or another programming language,
install the appropriate v2
or v3 client library.
In the examples shown here, PROJECT_ID represents your project ID, and
REGION_NAME represents the technical region name of the Google Cloud region
where you want to run the translation operation (such as us-central1 ).
Use ISO-639 codes to identify source
and target languages where necessary.
Cloud Translation - Basic API REST example
You can make a REST call with Cloud Translation - Basic API to
TranslateText using the
NMT model. You can put request fields into a JSON
file named something like request.json , like this:
{
"q" : [ "Hello world" , "My name is Jeff" ],
"target" : "de"
}
The Cloud Translation - Basic API supports the NMT model by default. You don't need to specify it. You can also specify the standard TLLM model if you pass its full resource name. Cloud Translation - Basic does not support customized models.
You can then use a curl command to submit the request:
!curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: cloud-ml-translate-e2e-testing" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
-d @request.json \
"https://translate.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2"
The response is a JSON document which looks like this:
{
"data" : {
"translations" : [
{
"translatedText" : "Hallo Welt" ,
"detectedSourceLanguage" : "en"
},
{
"translatedText" : "Mein Name ist Jeff" ,
"detectedSourceLanguage" : "en"
}
]
}
}
Cloud Translation - Basic API Python example
Here is sample Python code for calling TranslateText on the
NMT model using the Cloud Translation - Basic API.
Because no source language is specified, the API attempts to
detect it automatically.
def translate_text (
text : str | bytes | list [ str ] = "¡Hola amigos y amigas!" ,
target_language : str = "en" ,
source_language : str | None = None ,
) - > dict :
translate_client = translate_v2 . Client ()
if isinstance ( text , bytes ):
text = [ text . decode ( "utf-8" )]
if isinstance ( text , str ):
text = [ text ]
results = translate_client . translate (
values = text ,
target_language = target_language ,
source_language = source_language
)
for result in results :
if "detectedSourceLanguage" in result :
print ( f "Detected source language: { result [ 'detectedSourceLanguage' ] } " )
print ( f "Input text: { result [ 'input' ] } " )
print ( f "Translated text: { result [ 'translatedText' ] } " )
print ()
return results
translate_text ()
The output is as follows:
Detected source language: es
Input text: ¡Hola amigos y amigas!
Translated text: Hello friends!
[{'translatedText': 'Hello friends!',
'detectedSourceLanguage': 'es',
'input': '¡Hola amigos y amigas!'}]
Cloud Translation - Advanced API REST example
You can make a REST call with Cloud Translation - Advanced API to
TranslateText using the default
NMT model either by not specifying a model, or by
explicitly requesting the NMT model. Put request
fields into a JSON file named something like request.json , like this:
{
"sourceLanguageCode" : "en" ,
"targetLanguageCode" : "ru" ,
"contents" : [ "Dr. Watson, come here!" , "Bring me some coffee!" ],
"model" : "projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION_NAME/models/general/nmt"
}
You can then use a curl command to submit the request:
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
-d @request.json \
"https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION_NAME:translateText"
The response is a JSON document which looks like this:
{
"translations" : [
{
"translatedText" : "Доктор Ватсон, иди сюда!" ,
},
{
"translatedText" : "Принеси мне кофе!" ,
}
]
}
Cloud Translation - Advanced API Python example
def translate ():
response = translate_v3 . TranslationServiceClient () . translate_text (
contents = [ "Life is short." ,
"Art is long." ],
target_language_code = 'fr' ,
source_language_code = 'en' ,
parent = f "projects/ { project_id } /locations/us-central1" ,
model = f " { parent } /models/general/nmt"
)
print ( response )
return response
translate ()
The output is a JSON document which looks like this:
translat io ns {
translate d_ te x t : "La vie est courte."
model : "projects/261347268520/locations/us-central1/models/general/nmt"
}
translat io ns {
translate d_ te x t : "L&#39;art est long."
model : "projects/261347268520/locations/us-central1/models/general/nmt"
}
