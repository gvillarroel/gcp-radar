Create and manage models
Note : You can customize the Google Neural Machine Translation
(NMT) model using the Cloud Translation - Advanced API. We recommend that you use the Cloud Translation API to create
datasets and models because any future enhancements will apply only to the
Cloud Translation API. If you have existing AutoML resources, you can
upgrade them to work with the Cloud Translation API. For more information, see Upgrade AutoML
resources .
Create a custom model by using a prepared dataset. Cloud Translation
uses the segment pairs from the dataset to train, test, and evaluate a new
model.
Caution: Custom models run on a managed platform that is regularly
upgraded. Custom models must be re-trained at least every 18 months to
ensure consistent performance and stability in translations over time
and to get any benefits of the upgrades since original training.
Train models
After you have a dataset with enough segment pairs, you can create a custom
model from that dataset.
Web UI
Go to the Cloud Translation console.
Go to the
Translation page
From the navigation pane, click Datasets to view a list of your datasets.
Click the dataset to use to train a custom model.
The console shows the segment pairs in the dataset along with their
respective labels: Training , Validation , or Testing .
When you are done reviewing the dataset, click the Train tab.
Click Start Training to open the Train new model dialog.
Specify a name for the model.
Click Start Training to begin training your custom model.
Training a model can take several hours to complete. You can check the
training status by viewing recent activity.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : The region where the model will be located, such as
us-central1 . The source dataset must also be in the same
location.
MODEL_NAME : A name for the model.
DATASET_ID : The ID of the source dataset that
Cloud Translation uses to create the model.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /models
Request JSON body:
{
"display_name": " MODEL_NAME ",
"dataset": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /datasets/ DATASET_ID ",
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /models"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = " PROJECT_ID " } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /models" | Select-Object -Expand Content

{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID "
}

Get the status of a training job
You can check the status of a long-running task, like training a model, by using
the Google Cloud console or Cloud Translation API.
Web UI
You can monitor the training job status in the Recent activities pane.
Go to the Cloud Translation console.
Go to the
Translation page
From the navigation pane, click Datasets .
From the action bar, click View recent activities .
Find the related CreateModel operation. The icon next to operation ID
indicates the current status of the operations.
REST
To get the status of your training operation, send a GET request to
the operations resource along with the operation ID that was
included in the response after you submitted the training request.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID : the numeric or alphanumeric ID of your Google Cloud project
location-id : the location you chose for your Cloud Storage bucket
operation-id : operation ID you received above
