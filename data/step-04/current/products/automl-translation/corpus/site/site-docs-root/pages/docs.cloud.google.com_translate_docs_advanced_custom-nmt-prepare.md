Prepare training data
Cloud Translation trains custom models by using matching pairs of segments in the
source and target languages. It treats each segment pair as an independent
training item, without assuming any correlation between separate pairs.
The segment pairs that are used to train your custom model must be in the
tab-separated values ( .tsv ) or Translation Memory eXchange ( .tmx ) format.
For more information, see Prepare example translations .
Segment pairs are always de-duplicated across all imported pairs. A segment pair
is a duplicate of another when their source segment matches another source
segment. Cloud Translation doesn't allow you to import files with the same
content.
Data split
Cloud Translation uses the segment pairs that you provide to for
different purposes while creating your custom model:
Train - Segment pairs to train the model. Allocate most of your data for
this purpose.
Validation - Segment pairs to validate the results that the model returns
during training.
Test - Segment pairs to generate the final evaluation metrics of your
model. Indicates how the model might perform in production.
You can control which segment pairs Cloud Translation uses for each
purpose by uploading separate files for the training, validation, and testing
sets. If you don't explicitly specify which files to use for these three
purposes, Cloud Translation automatically divides your segment pairs
into three sets. Cloud Translation uses approximately 80% of your data
for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. Cloud Translation
randomly assigns your segment pairs into the three sets. You can have a maximum
of 10,000 segment pairs each for the validation and testing sets. After 10,000
pairs, segment pairs are pushed to the training set.
If you do multiple data imports into the same dataset, you can manually specify
the data split for one import and use the automatic split for another. Data is
always re-balanced with respect to your manual division after each import and
file deletion.
Note: If you exceed 100,000 segment pairs, you might have an unbalanced data
split because you can only include a maximum of 10,000 segment pairs for the
validation and test sets. Cloud Translation warns you but still allows
training to proceed.
Data requirements
Your training data must conform to the following requirements:
If you let Cloud Translation automatically split your data, you must
submit at least 1,000 segment pairs to train a custom model.
If you manually split your data, you must provide at least three segment
pairs for the TRAIN set, and you must have at least 100 segment pairs each
for the VALIDATION and TEST sets.
You must provide at least three segment pairs for the TRAIN set, and you
must have at least 100 segment pairs each for the VALIDATION and TEST
sets.
You cannot provide more than 10,000 segment pairs each for the VALIDATION
and TEST sets.
Your dataset cannot exceed the maximum of 15 million segment pairs.

Data recommendations
The following recommendations can help you increase the quality of your model:
Use at least 5,000 segment pairs for TRAIN , 500 segment pairs for
VALIDATION , and 500 segment pairs for TEST . That said, use more data if
possible. Having more data for the TRAIN set helps the model learn patterns,
and having more data for the VALIDATION and TEST sets help verify that the
model can be generalized to a wider variety of scenarios in your domain.
Keep segments to roughly 200 words or less. Cloud Translation might drop
segment pairs larger than that. For more information, see Import
issues .
