Translate documents
Cloud Translation - Advanced provides a Document Translation API for
directly translating formatted documents such as PDF and DOCX. Compared to
plain text translations, Document Translation preserves the original
formatting and layout in your translated documents, helping you retain much of
the original context like paragraph breaks.
The following sections describe how to translate documents and use
Document Translation with other Cloud Translation - Advanced features like
glossaries and AutoML Translation models. Document Translation
supports both online and batch translation requests.
For plain text and HTML translations, see Translating
text .
Supported file formats
Document Translation support the following input file types and their
associated output file types.
Inputs
Document MIME type
Output
DOC *
application/msword
DOC, DOCX
DOCX *
application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document
DOCX
PDF †
application/pdf
PDF, DOCX
PPT
application/vnd.ms-powerpoint
PPT, PPTX
PPTX
application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation
PPTX
XLS
application/vnd.ms-excel
XLS, XLSX
XLSX
application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet
XLSX
* Content inside text boxes aren't translated and remain in
the source language.
† Document Translation supports both native and
scanned PDF documents with some differences . For optimal format
handling, use native PDF files when possible. Translating scanned PDF files
results in some formatting loss. Complex PDF layouts can also result in some
formatting loss, which can include data tables, multi-column layouts, and graphs
with labels or legends.
If you have PDF content in the DOCX or PPTX format, we recommend that you
translate content by using those formats before converting them to PDFs. In
general, Document Translation preserves a document's layout and style
of DOCX and PPTX files better than PDF files. After a document translation, you
can then convert the results to PDF files.
Native and scanned PDF document translations
Document Translation supports both native and scanned PDF files,
including translations to or from right-to-left languages. Support for PDF to
DOCX conversions is available for batch document translations on native
PDF files only. Also, Document Translation preserves hyperlinks, font
size, and font color for native PDF files only (for both synchronous and batch
translations).
If you translate a PDF file with a mix of scanned and native PDF content, the
scanned content isn't translated.
Before you begin
Before you can start using the Cloud Translation API, you must have a project that has
the Cloud Translation API enabled, and you must have the appropriate credentials. You can
also install client libraries for common programming languages to help you make
calls to the API. For more information, see the Setup page.
Required permissions
For requests that require Cloud Storage access, such as batch
Document Translation, you might require Cloud Storage permissions to
read input files or send output files to a bucket. For example, to read input
files from a bucket, you must have at least read object permissions (provided by
the role roles/storage.objectViewer ) on the bucket. For more information about
Cloud Storage roles, see the Cloud Storage
documentation .
Translate documents (online)
Online translation provides real-time processing (synchronous processing) of a
single file.
For PDFs, the file size can be up to 20 MB and up to 300 pages for native PDFs
(requires the isTranslateNativePdfOnly field to be true ). If you enable the
enableShadowRemovalNativePdf field, the limit is 20 pages. For
scanned PDFs, the limit is 20 pages.
For other document types, the file sizes can be up to 20 MB with no page limits.
Translate a document from Cloud Storage
The following example translates a file from a Cloud Storage bucket and
outputs the result to a Cloud Storage bucket. The response also returns a
byte stream. You can specify the MIME type; if you don't,
Document Translation determines it by using the input file's extension.
If you don't specify a source language code, Document Translation
detects the language for you. The detected language is included in the output in
the detectedLanguageCode field.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID : The numeric or alphanumeric ID of your Google Cloud project.
LOCATION : Region where you want to run this operation. For
example, us-central1 .

the input document.
OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX : The Cloud Storage location where the
output document will be stored.
IS_NATIVE : (Optional) For native PDF documents, a boolean value
that indicates whether your request uses the native or scanned PDF page
limit. If true, the page limit is increased to 300 pages for native PDF
documents only. If false or unspecified, the scanned PDF page limit is used
(20 pages).

Use an AutoML model or a glossary
Instead of the Google-managed model, you can use your own AutoML
Translation models to translate documents. In addition to specifying a model,
you can also include a glossary to handle domain-specific terminology. If you
specify a model or a glossary, you must specify the source language. The
following example uses an AutoML model and a glossary. If the model or
glossary are in a different project, you must have the corresponding IAM
permission to access those resources.

Translate and convert a native PDF file
The following example translates and converts a native PDF file to a DOCX file.
You can specify multiple inputs of various file types; they don't all have to be
native PDF files. However, scanned PDF files cannot be included when including a
conversion; the request is rejected and no translations are done. Only native
PDF files are translated and converted to DOCX files. For example, if you
include PPTX files, they are translated and returned as PPTX files.
If you regularly translate a mix of scanned and native PDF files, we recommend
that you organize them into separate Cloud Storage buckets. That way,
when you request a batch translation and conversion, you can easily exclude the
bucket that contains scanned PDF files instead of having to exclude individual
files.

Use an AutoML model or a glossary
Instead of the Google-managed model, you can use your own AutoML
Translation models to translate documents. In addition to specifying a model,
you can also include a glossary to handle domain-specific terminology. If you
specify a model or a glossary, you must specify the source language. The
following example uses an AutoML model and a glossary. You can specify
up to 10 target languages with their own model and glossary.
If you specify a model for some target languages and not others,
Document Translation uses the Google-managed model for the unspecified
languages. Similarly, if you specify a glossary for some target languages,
Document Translation doesn't use any glossary for the unspecified
languages.
REST
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_NUMBER_OR_ID : the numeric or alphanumeric ID of your Google Cloud project
LOCATION : Region where you want to run this operation, such as
us-central1 . The location must match the region where your
model, glossary, or both are located.
SOURCE_LANGUAGE : The language code of the input
documents. Set to one of the language codes listed in Language support .
TARGET_LANGUAGE : The target language or languages to translate
the input documents to. Use the language codes listed in Language support .
INPUT_FILE_PATH : The Cloud Storage location and file name of
one or more input documents.
OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX : The Cloud Storage location where all
output documents are stored.
MODEL_PROJECT_ID : The project ID where the model is
located.
MODEL_LOCATION : The region where the model is located.
MODEL_ID : The ID of the model to use.
GLOSSARY_PROJECT_ID : The project ID where the glossary is
located.
GLOSSARY_LOCATION : The region where the glossary is located.
GLOSSARY_ID : The ID of the glossary to use.

Overlapping text
In some cases, native PDF translations might include translated text
overlaid on the source text. This issue is referred to as shadow text.
In certain cases, you can remove shadow text by enabling the
enableShadowRemovalNativePdf
option. If you enable this option, the response latency increases and, for
online document translations, the page limit is reduced to 20. You can only know
if your document requires shadow text removal only after it has been translated.
In other cases, if the enableShadowRemovalNativePdf option doesn't
work, convert the PDF to an image and then translate it. Typically, these cases
include multiple layers text, like when selectable text is on top of a
background image that also includes text. Converting the PDF to an image enables
Cloud Translation to process the document as a scanned PDF. To do the conversion,
you can use Chrome (print as image) or other third-party tools.
Text orientation
For scanned PDF translations , the source text must be oriented horizontally.
If, for example, a scanned document includes text that is sloping up or down,
Cloud Translation might not correctly parse all the text, which results in
incorrect or incomplete translations.
If your documents aren't consistently oriented, you can have Cloud Translation
orient them for you. In your translation request, enable the
enableRotationCorrection
option so that text is correctly oriented before translation.
