Custom translations overview
The default Google Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model
covers a wide range of languages and works well for general-purpose text.
However, in cases where you're translating domain-specific or style-sensitive
text, custom translations can help you get more relevant translations.
Custom translations require you to provide your own example translations. Then,
Cloud Translation can generate results that closely follow the style, tone,
and vocabulary of your examples.
The advanced version of the Cloud Translation API provides a variety of solutions for customizing
translations:
NMT customization :
You can train your own custom version of the standard
NMT model with a rich dataset of translation examples.
TLLM customization :
You can tune your own custom version of the standard
Translation LLM (TLLM) model with either a limited or extensive dataset of translation examples.
Adaptive Translation :
You can create a lightweight customization of the
Translation LLM (TLLM) model with a limited dataset of translation
examples.
Glossary : You can use a glossary
to serve as a custom dictionary for correctly and consistently translating
domain-specific terms.
NMT customization
To train your own version of the NMT model, you import
a substantial dataset of your own translation examples. You can then request
translations that use your model instead of the default
NMT model. A custom model of this kind can work well
for translating domain-specific text, where using the correct terminology
is extremely important.
You are charged both for the model training time and the number of input
characters that you send for translation.
TLLM customization
To train your own version of the TLLM model, you import
a dataset of your own translation examples. You can then request
translations that use your model instead of the default
TLLM model. A custom model of this kind can work well
for translating domain-specific text, where using the correct terminology
is extremely important.
You are charged both for the model training time and the number of input
characters that you send for translation.
Adaptive Translation
Adaptive translations use LLMs combined with small datasets to provide
high-quality translations, often on par with Cloud Translation custom
models. You don't train or maintain any models. Compared to custom models,
Adaptive Translation works well for getting responses that are similar in style,
tone, and voice with your input.
For Adaptive Translation, you're charged on the number of input and output
characters.
Glossaries
Glossaries allow you to specify how particular terms should be translated. You
provide a list of terms and their translations that Cloud Translation uses
to ensure consistent and accurate translations for those terms. This is
especially useful for domain-specific vocabulary.
You are charged for glossary usage based on the number of characters sent for
translation.
Prepare example translations
Prepare example translations as segment pairs, which consists of one sentence in
a source language and a corresponding sentence that's translated in the
target language. Save these segment pairs in a tab-separated values (TSV) file
or Translation Memory eXchange (TMX) file.
Choose examples that represent the linguistic domain of the content that you
plan to translation. For additional guidance, see the Data
preparation section.
TSV
For tab-separated files, each row has the following format:
Source segment tab Translated segment
Don't include a header row with language codes to identify the source and
target languages. You specify these languages when you create a dataset.
The following example includes segment pairs for English to German
translations:
It's a beautiful day. \t Es ist ein schöner Tag.
Tomorrow it will rain. \t Morgen wird es regnen.
All content in a TSV file must be plain text. If the text includes HTML tags or
other markup, Cloud Translation treats the markup as plain text.
TMX
TMX is a standard XML format for providing source and target translation
segments. Cloud Translation supports input files in a format based on
TMX version 1.4 . The following example illustrates the
required structure:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE tmx SYSTEM "tmx14.dtd">
<tmx version="1.4">
<header segtype="sentence" o-tmf="UTF-8"
adminlang="en" srclang="en" datatype="PlainText"/>
<body>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en">
<seg>It's a beautiful day.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="de">
<seg>Es ist ein schöner Tag.</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="en">
<seg>Tomorrow it will rain.</seg>
</tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="de">
<seg>Morgen wird es regnen.</seg>
</tuv>
</tu>
</body>
</tmx>
The <header> element of a well-formed TMX file must identify
the source language by using the srclang attribute, and every
<tuv> element must identify the language of the contained
text using the xml:lang attribute.
All <tu> elements must contain a pair of
<tuv> elements with the same source and target languages. If
a <tu> element contains more than two <tuv>
elements, Cloud Translation processes only the first
<tuv> matching the source language and the first matching
the target language and ignores the rest. If a <tu> element
does not have a matching pair of <tuv> elements,
Cloud Translation skips over the invalid <tu> element.
Cloud Translation strips the markup tags from around a
<seg> element before processing it. If a
<tuv> element contains more than one <seg>
element, Cloud Translation concatenates their text into a single
element with a space between them.
If the file contains XML tags other than those shown earlier,
Cloud Translation ignores them.
If the file does not conform to proper XML and TMX format (for
example, if it is missing an end tag or a <tmx> element)
Cloud Translation aborts processing it. Cloud Translation
also aborts processing if it skips more than 1024 invalid
<tu> elements.
The minimum required and maximum allowed number segment pairs for each feature
is different. For more information, see the Cloud Translation data
preparation or adaptive translation data
requirements .
