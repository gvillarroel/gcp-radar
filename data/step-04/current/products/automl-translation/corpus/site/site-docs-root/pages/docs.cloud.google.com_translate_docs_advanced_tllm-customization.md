Customize the TLLM model
Use Cloud Translation - Advanced API to customize the Google
Translation LLM (TLLM) model without
writing code. Tailor a custom model to your domain-specific
content, producing more accurate translations than with the default Google
TLLM model. The TLLM model covers a large number
of language pairs and does well with general-purpose text. A custom model
excels in handling specific, niche vocabularies. If you run a specialized reporting service that has the
opportunity to expand into new countries, instead of hiring specialists, create and refine a custom model to do the job in real time.
Data preparation
To train a custom model, supply matching pairs of segments
in the source and target languages. These are pairs of words or phrases that
mean the same thing in the languages you're translating from and to. The closer in meaning your segment
pairs are, the better your model can work. While putting together the dataset of matching segment pairs, start with the
use case:
What outcome are you trying to achieve?
What kinds of segments are important to translate correctly, to
achieve that outcome? Can the TLLM model achieve it
out of the box?
Is it possible for humans to translate these key segments in a way that
satisfies you? If the translation task is ambiguous enough that a person
fluent in both languages would have a hard time doing a satisfactory job,
the TLLM model might perform as well as a custom model.
What kinds of examples best reflect the type and range of segment pairs
that your system will need to translate?
Match data to your problem domain
Train a custom translation model to fit a particular linguistic domain. Ensure your segment pairs do the best
possible job of covering the vocabulary, usage, and grammatical quirks of your
industry or area of focus. Find documents with typical usages for the translation tasks you want accomplished, matching your parallel
phrases as close in meaning as you can. Languages don't map perfectly in vocabulary or syntax, but try to capture the
full diversity of semantics you expect to encounter. You're building on a model that already does a good job with
general-purpose translation. Your examples are the last step to tweak custom models, so make sure
they're relevant and representative.
Capture the diversity of your linguistic space
Don't assume that how people write about a specific domain is uniform enough that a small number of text samples translated by a few translators should train a model that works for
anyone else writing about that domain. We each bring a personality to the words we write, so a training dataset with segment
pairs from many authors and translators is more likely to give you a model that's useful for translating writing from a diverse organization.
Also consider the variety of segment lengths and structures: A dataset
where all the segments are the same size or share a grammatical
structure won't build a model that captures all the possibilities.
Source your data
After you've established what data you need, find a way to source
it. Take into account all data your organization
collects. You might find that you're already collecting what you need
to train a translation model. If you don't have the data you need,
get it manually or outsource it to a third party.
Keep humans in the loop
Try to make sure a person who understands both languages well
has validated that the segment pairs match and represent
understandable, accurate translations. A common mistake, like misaligning the
rows of your training data spreadsheet, can yield nonsensical translations. High-quality data is needed
for Cloud Translation - Advanced API to get a usable model.
Keep fairness in mind with segment pairs
A core principle underpinning Google's ML products is human-centered machine
learning, an approach that promotes
responsible AI practices ,
including fairness. The goal of fairness in ML is to understand and prevent
unjust or prejudicial treatment of people related to race, income, sexual
orientation, religion, gender, and other characteristics historically
associated with discrimination and marginalization, when and where they
manifest in algorithmic systems or algorithmically aided decision-making.
Clean up messy data
You might make mistakes when preprocessing data, which can
confuse a custom model. Look for the following data
issues that you can fix:
Remove duplicate source segments, particularly if they have different target
translations, ensuring that Cloud Translation - Advanced API uses your preferred translation.
Align source segments to the correct target segments.
Match segments to the specified language. (Example: Include only Chinese
segments in a Chinese dataset.)
For target segments with mixed languages, check that untranslated
words are intentionally untranslated. Target segments that mistakenly include untranslated words add
noise to your data, which can lower model quality.
Fix segments with typographical or grammatical errors.
Remove non-translatable content such as placeholder tags and HTML tags.
Non-translatable content can result in punctuation errors.
Don't include segment pairs that replace general things with specific nouns.
For example, translating a general term like president to JFK .
Instead, remove these or change the specific nouns to general ones.
Remove duplicate segments in the training and test sets.
Use consistent casing, which affects how a model learns, like distinguishing headline from body text.
Process data
The following limitations apply:
Maximum input and output tokens:
Serving: 1,000 (about 4,000 characters)
Validation dataset size: 1,024 examples
Training dataset file size: Up to 1GB for JSONL
Training example length: 1,000 (about 4,000 characters)
Adapter size:
Translation LLM V2 : Supported value is only 4. Using any other values (e.g., 1 or 8) will result in failure.
Debug
Debugging a custom model is more about debugging the data than the model
itself. If your model isn't translating the way you intend, check your data
to see where it can be improved.
Test
Even if your evaluation scores look okay, check the model
to make sure its performance matches your expectations. If your
training and test data are drawn from the same incorrect set of samples, the
scores might be excellent even if the translation is nonsense. Prepare some examples
that are not in the training set. Compare the results from the custom model
with the Google TLLM base model.
You might find that your model comes up with the same predictions as the base, especially on short
segments or if you have a smaller training set, because the base model is already good. If so, try longer or more
complex segments. If your segments come back identical to the
predictions from the base model, it might indicate a data problem.
If there's a mistake that you're worried about your model making, make sure your test set or procedure covers that case
adequately for you to feel safe using your model.
