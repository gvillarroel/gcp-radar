Translate text by using adaptive translation
When you request an adaptive translation, you provide the text to translate and
example translations that Cloud Translation uses to tailor its responses.
For programmatic translation requests, you can include example translations in a
dataset or as part of your translation request. When you use a dataset,
Cloud Translation automatically selects five reference sentences that are
most similar to your source sentence to customize translations. If you include
reference sentences in your translation request, Cloud Translation uses all
of them to customize the translation.
Before you begin
To use adaptive translation, you must enable the Cloud Translation API in your
project and set up authentication. For more information, see the
Cloud Translation Setup .
Also, check that your source and target languages are
supported by adaptive translation.
Data requirements and suggestions
If you create a dataset or use the Google Cloud console, you must provide
example translations in a TSV or TMX file . The examples must be
sentence pairs in your intended source and target languages. We recommend that
you provide examples that cover the vocabulary, usage, and grammatical quirks of
your domain. For additional tips, see Data preparation in the
AutoML Translation documentation.
Your data must include at least 5 sentence pairs and no more than 10,000 pairs
if you use the console and no more than 30,000 pairs if you use the API. A
segment pair can be at most 512 characters (total).
Limitations
You can translate to only one target language at a time.
Adaptive translation has limits on the number of input and output characters.
For more information, see the Adaptive translation limits
on the Quotas page.
Request translations
For translations, the input can be plain text or HTML. Cloud Translation doesn't
translate any HTML tags in the input, only text that appears between the tags.
The output retains the (untranslated) HTML tags, with the translated text
between the tags to the extent possible due to differences between the source
and target languages.
Note: Cloud Translation API does not support input text that uses other markup
languages such as XML. The result when attempting to translate content with
other forms of markup is undefined.
Console
When using the Google Cloud console, select a file that includes your
example translations and then request translations. Cloud Translation
doesn't store your imported data. If you prefer to work with persistent
datasets, use the API.
Go to the AutoML Translation console.
Go to the Adaptive Translation page
Select a local file or a file in Cloud Storage that contains your
example translations.
After you select a file, Cloud Translation sets the Source
language and Target language fields based on your data. For example,
if you import an English to Portuguese dataset, the console lets you
translate only English sentences to Portuguese.
Enter text in the source language field.
Adaptive translation does have limits on the number of input and output
characters. For more information, see the Adaptive
translation limits on the Quotas page.
To adjust parameters, use the sliders or text fields to set values:
Temperature - Controls the degree of randomness in token selection.
For lower temperatures, expect a true or correct response. For higher
temperatures, expect more diverse or unexpected results.
Number of examples - Sets the number of examples to use from your
source data to prompt the LLM.
Select Compare with NMT model to include translations from the default
Google NMT model along with the adaptive translation output.
Click Translate .
In a few moments, Cloud Translation returns a response in the target
language field. Cloud Translation doesn't return any text beyond the
output character limit.
API
Use the API to request adaptive translations by including reference sentence
pairs or by specifying a dataset.
Adaptive translations with reference sentence pairs
Adaptive translations with a dataset
Note: The API has a limit of one QPS per project.
Adaptive translations with reference sentence pairs
To include example translations as part of your translation requests, include
your example source and target sentence pairs in the referenceSentencePairs
field, which is part of the referenceSentenceConfig object. For more
information, see the adaptiveMtTranslate method.
You can include up to five sentence pairs.

pairs first. If you already have a dataset, you can request adaptive
translations with it. The dataset persists in your project until you delete
it.

Request an adaptive translation by providing the source text to translate
and the dataset that Cloud Translation uses to customize the
translation.
Cloud Translation uses the source and target language from the
