Translating text from a photo
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows how to detect text in an image, how to
personalize translations,
and how to generate synthetic speech from text.
This tutorial uses Cloud Vision to detect text
in an image file. Then, this tutorial shows how to use Cloud Translation
to provide a custom translation of the detected text.
Finally, this tutorial uses Text-to-Speech to provide
machine dictation of the translated text.
Objectives
Pass text recognized by the Cloud Vision API to the Cloud Translation API.
Create and use Cloud Translation glossaries to personalize
Cloud Translation API translations.
Create an audio representation of translated text using the
Text-to-Speech API.
Costs
Each Google Cloud API uses a separate pricing structure.
For pricing details, refer to the Cloud Vision pricing guide ,
the Cloud Translation pricing guide ,
and the Text-to-Speech pricing guide .
Before you begin
Make sure that you have:
A project in the Google Cloud console with the Vision API, the Cloud Translation API, and the Text-to-Speech API
enabled
A basic familiarity with Python or NodeJS programming
Setting up client libraries
This tutorial uses Vision ,
Translation ,
and Text-to-Speech
client libraries.
To install the relevant client libraries,
run the following commands from the terminal.
Python
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-vision
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-translate
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-texttospeech
Node.js
npm install @google-cloud/vision
npm install @google-cloud/translate
npm install @google-cloud/text-to-speech
Setting up permissions for glossary creation
Creating Translation glossaries requires using a service account
key
with "Cloud Translation API Editor" permissions.
To set up a service account key with Cloud Translation API Editor permissions, do
the following:
Create a service account:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service Accounts page.
Go to
Service Accounts
Select your project.
Click add Create Service Account .
In the Service account name field, enter a name. The
Google Cloud console fills in the Service account ID field based on
this name.
Optional: In the Service account description field, enter a
description for the service account.
Click Create and continue .
Click the Select a role field and select
Cloud Translation > Cloud Translation API Editor
Click Done to finish creating the service account.
Do not close your browser window. You will use it in the next step.
Download a JSON key for the service account you just created:
In the Google Cloud console, click the email address for the service
account that you created.
Click Keys .
Click Add key , then click Create new key .
Click Create . A JSON key file is downloaded to your computer.
Make sure to store the key file securely, because it can be used to
authenticate as your service account. You can move and rename this file
however you would like.
Click Close .
In your terminal, set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS variable
using the following command.
Replace path_to_key with the path to the downloaded JSON file containing your new service account key.
Linux or macOS
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS= path_to_key
Windows
set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS= path_to_key

Setting your project ID
You must associate a Google Cloud project with
each request to a Google Cloud API. Designate your Google Cloud project
by setting the GCLOUD_PROJECT environment variable from the
terminal.
In the following command, replace project-id with your Google Cloud project ID.
Run the following command from the terminal.
Linux or macOS
export GCLOUD_PROJECT = project-id
Windows
set GCLOUD_PROJECT = project-id
Using Vision to detect text from an image
Use the Vision API to detect and extract text from an image.
The Vision API uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
to support two text-detection features:
detection of dense text, or DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION ,
and sparse text detection, or
TEXT_DETECTION .
The following code shows how to use the Vision API
DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION
feature to detect
text in a photo with dense text.
Python
Before trying this sample, follow the Python setup instructions in the
Cloud Translation quickstart using
client libraries .
For more information, see the
Cloud Translation Python API
reference documentation .
To authenticate to Cloud Translation, set up Application Default Credentials.

"""
# Instantiates a client
client = vision . ImageAnnotatorClient ()
# Opens the input image file
with open ( infile , "rb" ) as image_file :
content = image_file . read ()
image = vision . Image ( content = content )
# For dense text, use document_text_detection
# For less dense text, use text_detection
response = client . document_text_detection ( image = image )
text = response . full_text_annotation . text
print ( f "Detected text: { text } " )
return text
Node.js

async function picToText ( inputFile ) {
// Creates a client
const client = new vision . ImageAnnotatorClient ();
// Performs text detection on the local file
const [ result ] = await client . textDetection ( inputFile );
return result . fullTextAnnotation . text ;
}
Using Translation with glossaries
After extracting text from an image, use Translation glossaries
to personalize the translation of the extracted text.
Glossaries provide pre-defined translations that override the Cloud Translation API
translations of designated terms.
Glossary use cases include:
Product names: For example, 'Google Home' must translate to 'Google Home'.
Ambiguous words: For example, the word 'bat' can mean a piece of sports equipment or an animal.
If you know that you are translating words about sports, you might want to use a glossary to feed the
Cloud Translation API the sports translation of 'bat', not the animal translation.
Borrowed words: For example, 'bouillabaisse' in French translates to 'bouillabaisse' in English;
the English language borrowed the word 'bouillabaisse' from the French language.
An English speaker lacking French cultural context might not know that bouillabaisse is
a French fish stew dish. Glossaries can override a translation so that
'bouillabaisse' in French translates to 'fish stew' in English.
Making a glossary file
The Cloud Translation API accepts TSV, CSV, or TMX glossary files. This tutorial uses a CSV file
uploaded to Cloud Storage to define sets of equivalent terms.
To make a glossary CSV file:
Designate the language of a column using either ISO-639
or BCP-47 language codes in the first row of the CSV file.
fr,en,
List pairs of equivalent terms in each row of the CSV file.
Separate terms with commas.
The following example defines the English translation for several culinary French words.
fr,en,
chèvre,goat cheese,
crème brulée,crème brulée,
bouillabaisse,fish stew,
steak frites,steak with french fries,
Define variants of a word . The Cloud Translation API is case-sensitive and sensitive to special characters such as accented words.
Ensure that your glossary handles variations on a word by explicitly defining
different spellings of the word.
fr,en,
chevre,goat cheese,
Chevre,Goat cheese,
chèvre,goat cheese,
Chèvre,Goat cheese,
crème brulée,crème brulée,
Crème brulée,Crème brulée,
Crème Brulée,Crème Brulée,
bouillabaisse,fish stew,
Bouillabaisse,Fish stew,
steak frites,steak with french fries,
Steak frites,Steak with french fries,
Steak Frites,Steak with French Fries,
Upload the glossary to a
Cloud Storage bucket .
For the purposes of this tutorial, you do not need to upload a glossary file to a
Cloud Storage bucket nor do you need to create a Cloud Storage bucket.
Instead, use the publicly-available glossary file created for this tutorial
to avoid incurring any Cloud Storage costs. Send the URI of a glossary
file in Cloud Storage to the Cloud Translation API to create a
glossary resource.
The URI of the publicly-available glossary file for this tutorial is
gs://cloud-samples-data/translation/bistro_glossary.csv .
To download the glossary, click on the above URI link, but do not open it in a new tab.
Creating a glossary resource
In order to use a glossary, you must create a glossary resource
with the Cloud Translation API.
To create a glossary resource,
send the URI of a glossary file in Cloud Storage to
the Cloud Translation API.
Make sure that you are using a service account key with
"Cloud Translation API Editor" permissions
and make sure that you have set your project ID from the terminal .
The following function creates a glossary resource. With this glossary resource,
you can personalize the translation request in the next step
of this tutorial.

Using Text-to-Speech with Speech Synthesis Markup Language
Now that you have personalized a translation
of image-detected text, you are ready to
use the Text-to-Speech API. The Text-to-Speech API
can create synthetic
audio of your translated text.
The Text-to-Speech API generates synthetic audio from
either a string of plain text
or a string of text marked up with Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) .
SSML is a markup language which supports annotating text with
SSML tags .
You can use SSML tags to influence how the Text-to-Speech API
formats synthetic speech creation .
The following function converts a string of SSML to an MP3 file of synthetic speech.
