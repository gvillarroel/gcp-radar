Create and manage prediction results
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page shows you how to create and manage AML AI prediction
results. Prediction results are saved to BigQuery tables.
For more information about the content of prediction results, see
Understand prediction outputs .
Before you begin
To get the permissions that
you need to create and manage prediction results,
ask your administrator to grant you the
Financial Services Admin ( financialservices.admin )
IAM role on your project.
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Create an instance
Create a model
Create a dataset
Create prediction results
Some API methods return a
long-running operation (LRO).
These methods are asynchronous and return an Operation object; for details, see
REST Reference . The
operation might not be completed when the method returns a response. For these methods, send the
request and then check for the result. In general, all POST, PUT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations are
long-running.
Send the request
To create prediction results, use the
projects.locations.instances.predictionResults.create
method.
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions:
Permissions
financialservices.v1predictions.create
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID listed in
the IAM Settings
LOCATION : the location of the instance;
use one of the
supported regions

INSTANCE_ID : a user-defined identifier for the instance
PREDICTION_RESULTS_ID : a user-defined identifier for the prediction results
MODEL_ID : a user-defined identifier for the model
DATASET_ID : the user-defined identifier for the
dataset
used for predictions; tables should not have the training label columns
PREDICTION_END_DATE : The latest time from which
data is used to generate features for predictions. This date should be the same or earlier than the
end time of the datasets. Use RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format (for example, 2014-10-02T15:01:23Z ).
PREDICTION_PERIODS : The number
of consecutive months to produce predictions for, ending with the last full month prior to the
prediction end date according to the dataset's timezone.
BQ_OUTPUT_DATASET_NAME : the name of the output
BigQuery dataset used for prediction
BQ_OUTPUT_PREDICTION_TABLE : the user-defined
identifier for the output BigQuery table used for predictions
BQ_OUTPUT_PREDICTION_EXPLAINABILITY_TABLE : the user-defined
identifier for the output explainability BigQuery table used for prediction;
remove the optional explainabilityDestination object from the request JSON if you don't
want to export to a BigQuery table
WRITE_DISPOSITION : the action that occurs
if the destination table already exists; use one of the following values:
WRITE_EMPTY : Only export data if the BigQuery table is empty.
WRITE_TRUNCATE : Erase all existing data in the BigQuery table
before writing to the table.
