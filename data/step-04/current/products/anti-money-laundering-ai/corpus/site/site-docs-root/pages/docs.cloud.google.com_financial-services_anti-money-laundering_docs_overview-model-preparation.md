Overview of model preparation
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page leads you through the steps to prepare an AML AI
model, assuming you have already set up an instance and prepared the necessary
datasets.
Overview of stages
The process to prepare a model is in covered in the following three stages:
Stage 1 :
Configure an engine ,
including selecting the source of hyperparameters:
Tuning: Automatic tuning of hyperparameters
Inherit: Inherit hyperparameters from a previous engine config
that was created with an earlier engine version within the same
tuning version .
This setting lets you avoid re-tuning each time you adopt a new model
engine version.
Creating an engine config
stores the results from tuning or inheritance in an
EngineConfig resource .
Stage 2 :
Generate a model
Creating a model
triggers training, storing the results as a
Model resource .
Stage 3 :
Evaluate a model
Creating backtest results
evaluates model performance on a specified set of months, storing summary
results in a
BacktestResult resource .
Optionally,
creating prediction results
lets you evaluate per-party outputs of the model.
Once you have completed the earlier stages and model performance meets your
needs, see the guidance in sections Generate risk scores and explainability and
Prepare for model and risk governance .
Before you begin
Before you begin, you will need the following:
One or more
datasets
A selected
engine version
to use
Dataset requirements
For detailed guidance on the data model and schema, see the pages under
Prepare Data for AML AI . This section covers how to make sure that the datasets
used in engine tuning, training, and evaluation work well together.
Note : Most model governance policies define a requirement to track data lineage used
across all ML operations from engine configuration, training, and evaluation. To ensure data remains unchanged, we recommend that you
create a BigQuery table snapshot
of your BigQuery tables after they pass data validation and reference the snapshot in
the AML AI dataset. If you reference regularly updated tables, AML AI
operations read the BigQuery tables each time an operation uses the AML AI
dataset, so changes to the underlying BigQuery tables could impact tuning, training,
backtesting, and predictions.
Dataset time ranges
Each dataset used for tuning, training, backtesting and prediction operations
should contain valid data for a time range ending at the end of the last full
calendar month prior to the end_time specified in the API call. The length of
this time range depends on the table, Engine Version and operation. The minimum
time range is covered in detail in Understand data scope and duration .
For example, for engine tuning with v004.004 engine versions, the Transaction
table should cover at least 30 months.
Configuring an engine, training, and evaluation (backtesting) can be completed
with a single dataset; see the following image. To ensure good production
performance by avoiding overfitting, you should ensure that the period used for
evaluation (that is, creating backtest results) is after the period used for
training (that is, creating a model).
For example: if using 3 periods for backtesting and using periods up to the end
of February 2024 for training (that is, end time in early March 2024), then you
could use periods up to the end of May 2024 for backtesting (that is, end time
in early June 2024).
Dataset consistency
When using different datasets for the engine tuning, training, and evaluation
stages, make the datasets consistent in which fields are populated and how they
are populated. This is important for AML model stability and performance.
Similarly, for a high-quality risk score , the
dataset used to create prediction results with a model should be consistent with
the dataset used to train that model.
In particular, ensure the following:
The same logic is used to populate each field. Changing the logic used
to populate a field can introduce feature skew between model training and
prediction or evaluation.
The same selection of RECOMMENDED fields are populated. For example,
removing a field that was populated during model training can cause features
that the model relies on to be skewed or missing during evaluation or
prediction.
The same logic is used to provide values. In the
PartySupplementaryData table, the same logic is used to
provide values for each party_supplementary_data_id field.
Using the same data, but with different party_supplementary_data_id
values, causes the model to use data incorrectly. For example, a
particular field uses ID 5 in the
PartySupplementaryData table for one dataset, but then
uses ID 7 in another dataset.
Removing a party_supplementary_data_id value that a model relies on
may have unpredictable effects. For example, ID 3 is used in the
PartySupplementaryData table in one dataset but is
omitted from another dataset.
Now you have a dataset ready for engine tuning, training, and evaluation. Note
that model operations can take tens of hours . For information on how to
check if an operation is still running or has completed (failed or succeeded),
see
Manage long-running operations .
