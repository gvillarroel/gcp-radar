This page briefly covers concepts behind configuring an engine.
Before v004.009
v004.009 and later
This page is valid for the engine versions within the following major engine
version groupings. To view the page for other engine versions, use the selector
at the top of this page.
aml-retail.default.v004.009
aml-commercial.default.v004.009
In summary, here are the changes from engine versions v003 to v004 (up to v004.008):
Added partiesCount and identifiedPartiesCount to the
ExpectedRecallPreTuning and ExpectedRecallPostTuning metrics values.
Supported sources for hyperparameters
When configuring an engine, you can select the source of the
hyperparameters that are used to create a model. The following sources are
supported:
Automatic tuning: AML AI tunes hyperparameters when you
create an EngineConfig resource (default behavior)
Inherit: Inherit hyperparameters from a previous engine config that was
created with an earlier engine version within the same tuning version .
This setting lets you avoid re-tuning each time you adopt a new model engine
version.
When to tune or inherit
The following sections outline when you should select automatic tuning and when you
should inherit hyperparameters from a previous engine config.
When to tune
You have the option to tune each new engine config and, when in doubt, you
should always tune for best performance outcomes. See section
How to tune an engine for more information.
For best performance, you should consider engine tuning when any of the
following occur:
You make significant changes to dataset logic. For example, when any of the
following change:
The logic by which fields are populated
The selection of RECOMMENDED fields that are populated
The logic or selection of data provided in the
PartySupplementaryData table
You're about to have an engine train a model for a new region .
Note: Engine tuning is a billable operation requiring significant compute
resources and may take days to complete. For more information, see the
Pricing page .
When to inherit hyperparameters
To save time and costs when adopting a new engine version, you can inherit
hyperparameters from a previous engine using the same tuning version. See section
How to adopt an engine version without re-tuning .
Note: This inheritance requires an existing engine config, within the same tuning
engine version, to use as a source for hyperparameters. This is supported on
all engine versions with tuning version v004 and higher, and released from
2024-02-22. For more information, see the
engine version release notes .
Engine versions with tuning version v003, and engine versions released prior to
2024-02-22, don't support the inheriting of hyperparameters, but these versions
may be used as a source of hyperparameters.
How to tune an engine
To trigger tuning, see Create and manage engine configs .
In particular, you need to select the following:
The data to use for engine tuning:
Specify a dataset and an end time within the date range of the dataset.
Engine tuning uses labels and features based on complete calendar months up
to, but not including, the month of the selected end time. For more
information, see Dataset time ranges .
The engine version to use for engine tuning:
Select an engine version that matches the line of business (retail or
commercial) that you will use the associated models for.
The volume of investigations you expect based on the models:
Specify partyInvestigationsPerPeriodHint . This is used by engine tuning,
training, and backtesting to ensure AML AI delivers
performance at your monthly investigation volume.
Engine tuning output
Engine tuning generates an EngineConfig resource , which can be used to
create a Model resource .
The engine config metadata contains the following metrics. In particular,
these metrics show you the following:
Expected performance gain from engine tuning versus using the default
hyperparameters
Note : Recall metrics only show the share of historical
AML_EXIT
events that would be alerted with a given model, and can be used to decide to proceed to live
testing. Given that not all customers alerted by the model have previously been investigated,
real-life performance is expected to be significantly better.
Measurements which can be used to assess dataset consistency (for example,
by comparing the missingness values of feature families from different
operations)
Metric name
Metric description
Example metric value
ExpectedRecallPreTuning
Recall metric measured on a test set when using
default hyperparameters of the engine version.
This recall measurement assumes the number of investigations per month
specified in partyInvestigationsPerPeriodHint .
{
"recallValues": [
{
"partyInvestigationsPerPeriod": 5000,
"recallValue": 0.72,
"partiesCount": 100,
"identifiedPartiesCount": 72,
"scoreThreshold": 0.42,
},
],
}
ExpectedRecallPostTuning
Recall metric measured on a test set when using
tuned hyperparameters .
This recall measurement assumes the number of investigations per month
specified in partyInvestigationsPerPeriodHint .
{
"recallValues": [
{
"partyInvestigationsPerPeriod": 5000,
"recallValue": 0.80,
"partiesCount": 100,
"identifiedPartiesCount": 80,
"scoreThreshold": 0.43,
},
],
}
Missingness
Share of missing values across all features in each feature family.
Ideally, all AML AI feature families should have a
Missingness near to 0. Exceptions may occur where the data underlying
those feature families is unavailable for integration.
A significant change in this value for any feature family between tuning,
training, evaluation, and prediction can indicate inconsistency in the
datasets used.
{
"featureFamilies": [
{
"featureFamily": "unusual_wire_credit_activity",
"missingnessValue": 0.00,
},
...
...
{
"featureFamily": "party_supplementary_data_id_3",
"missingnessValue": 0.45,
},
],
}
How to adopt an engine version without re-tuning
To re-use hyperparameters from a previous engine config, see section
Create an engine config that inherits hyperparameters (on the
Create and manage engine configs page). In particular, you need to select
the following:
Hyperparameter source type: Select INHERITED as the
hyperparameterSourceType . If you don't specify the source type, the
hyperparameter source type is set to TUNING to allow for backwards
compatibility.
Hyperparameter source: Specify the full resource name of the source
engine config in the hyperparameterSource object. The outputs of the
source engine config are used for the new engine config. The source engine
config must have been created with an earlier engine version within the same
tuning engine version
that you are now using.
Engine version to use for the engine config:
Select an engine version that matches the line of business (retail or
commercial) for the models you want to use. If inheriting hyperparameters, the
line of business must match the line of business used for the hyperparameter
source.
Output and lineage when inheriting
Inheriting hyperparameters from another engine version creates an
EngineConfig resource which can be used to create a Model resource using
the hyperparameters from the source engine config.
For lineage, the following fields in the EngineConfig resource are set as
follows when inheriting hyperparameters from another engine config:
hyperparameterSourceType : INHERITED
hyperparameterSource : The engine config used as the hyperparameter source
tuning : Original tuning object, including the reference to the
dataset used for the original engine tuning ( primaryDataset ) and the
latest time from which data was used to generate features for training
( endTime )
performanceTarget : Original performanceTarget object, including the
volume of investigations expected based on the specified models
( partyInvestigationsPerPeriodHint )
Engine config metadata from the original engine tuning
