Evaluate model fairness
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
It is crucial to evaluate model fairness to avoid perpetuating biases and
discrimination. This page focuses on the importance of fairness assessment in
AML risk scoring models, provides insights into the application of equality of
odds (as one example measure), and provides potential routes for mitigations.
Relevance
There are several reasons why model fairness should be evaluated, including the
following:
Creating or amplifying negative societal biases and harms: Model fairness is
vital to prevent discrimination against individuals based on their
demographic attributes, such as gender, race, or age.
Regulatory compliance: Banks must adhere to legal and ethical standards,
including anti-discrimination laws and regulations.
Maintaining trust: Fairness in AML risk scoring models helps maintain
customer trust and promotes a positive reputation for the bank.
How to calculate model fairness
There are several ways to assess fairness in machine learning (see
general best practices ).
We recommend considering
equality of odds
to assess model fairness. In this context, equality of odds measures whether the
model provides equal treatment to parties from different demographic groups with
respect to their risk scores.
To calculate equality of odds, do the following:
Define protected groups that you want to test model fairness for:
Your bank typically has model governance in place on protected
categories. These may include gender, race, bucketed age, and other
categories.
In the Party table, the fields we recommend to use have a
note saying "Typically also used for fairness evaluation".
For each protected category, calculate the following metrics:
True Positive Rate (TPR) : The proportion of individuals correctly
classified as high risk among those who are truly high risk based on the
risk scores assigned by the model.
The False Negative Rate (FNR) is (1 - TPR). This is another way to
measure how often a model incorrectly misses the target for a certain
group.
False Positive Rate (FPR) : The proportion of individuals incorrectly
classified as high risk among those who are actually low risk based on
the risk scores assigned by the model.
You can use this
SQL script template
for the calculation, adjusting as needed to the particular sensitive
dimensions for which you need to do fairness analysis.
Compare the TPR and FPR values across different demographic groups.
Important considerations in computing TPR and FPR include the following:
Carefully specify the complete set of examples for which TPR and FPR will be
calculated; for example, counting all parties in a single line of business
once at a specific date d .
Carefully specify what defines an actual positive example; for example, a
party for whom any alert from any system and investigation starting after
date d resulted in triggering of the customer exit process for AML-related
reasons.
Carefully specify what counts as a positive prediction; for example, all
customers for whom AML AI risk scores for the date d are
above a chosen risk score threshold, which you would use to trigger alerts.
How to interpret results and mitigation approaches
A higher false positive rate for a specific slice or demographic group means
that the model is more likely to incorrectly classify individuals from that
group as high risk, leading to unnecessary investigations. This indicates that
individuals from that demographic group are being disproportionately flagged for
investigation, potentially resulting in increased scrutiny or inconvenience for
individuals who may not actually pose a higher risk.
A lower true positive rate for a specific slice or demographic group means
that the model is less effective at correctly classifying individuals from that
group as high risk, resulting in a higher rate of false negatives. This
indicates that individuals from that demographic group who should be flagged for
investigation are more likely to be missed or overlooked by the model compared
to other groups.
Disparities in the FPRs and TPRs, and thresholds on when to investigate those
further should be considered in your model risk governance process. Where you
decide the risk merits further investigation, the following are possible root
causes and mitigations to consider.
Potential root causes
The following list outlines potential root causes for disparities in the false
positive rate and the true positive rate between demographic groups:
Insufficient positive examples: You have not caught enough of this sort of
customer (not enough positive investigations or alerts). You may not be
investigating enough or this sort of customer is not risky very often.
Many positive examples that are not properly justified: You detect defensive
suspicious activity report (SAR) bias or customer exit bias toward a
particular customer group.
Insufficient total examples: You don't have enough of this sort of customer
in your customer base.
Other aspects of data quality and model generation can also impact fairness.
Mitigation options
The following list outlines mitigation options for the root causes in the
previous section:
Consider redirecting investigator capacity toward customer groups with
higher TPR and / or lower FPR in order to rebalance these values in the
future
Review the investigation process and historical investigations for biased
outcomes for slices with significant disparity in FPR or TPR
Randomize the investigations to get more positive examples
Review your party supplementary data (see
Supplementary data ). Consider removing data that heavily
correlates to sensitive categories and adding data that expresses the
underlying (unbiased) risk factor. For example, consider a case where model
alerts are concentrated in a few certain ZIP codes. The underlying risk
factor could be a concentration of cash-intensive businesses there rather
than the geographical area itself.
The following is not recommended :
Remove parties or risk case events for specific customer groups to
rebalance FPR or TPR (in effect, undersampling). Due to the networked nature
of AML AI data and features, this may have unpredictable
impact on model behavior and performance.
If you still find that model risk governance is blocked on fairness, then we
suggest you continue using your current engine version or dataset and
contact support
for additional guidance.
