Authentication verifies the identity of the requestor (who), while authorization determines their access to resources (what).
Before accessing Google Workspace APIs, you need to configure your Google Cloud project, authenticate your app, and potentially obtain user consent.
Access tokens, granted by Google's authorization server, enable your app to access specific resources and functionalities.
Key terms to understand include authentication, authorization, credentials (API keys, OAuth 2.0 Client IDs, service accounts), scopes, and access tokens.
For accessing user data, you'll typically utilize OAuth 2.0 Client IDs or service accounts with domain-wide delegation of authority.
Authentication and authorization are mechanisms used to verify identity and
access to resources, respectively. This document identifies key terms that you
should know before implementing authentication and authorization in your app.
Authentication identifies who is making the request.
Authorization identifies what resources the requester can access
and what level of access they have. Authentication is a prerequisite for
authorization. You can't determine what resources to access without first
establishing the identity of the requester. For a more detailed definition,
see the Important terminology section .
Consider the following simplified example of a hotel reservation. When you
arrive at the hotel, the front desk clerk requests your ID to verify your
reservation. Your ID authenticates you to the hotel. The front desk clerk
gives you a hotel key. This key gives you access to certain resources at the
hotel such as your hotel room, the gym, and the business center. The hotel
key authorizes you to access those resources.
Note: This overview focuses on authentication and authorization for
Google Workspace APIs. Some information in this document might not pertain to
other Google APIs.
Process overview
The following diagram shows the high-level steps of authentication and
authorization for Google Workspace APIs:
Figure 1. High-level steps of an authentication and
authorization implementation
Configure your Google Cloud project and app: During development, you
register your app in the Google Cloud console, defining authorization scopes
and access credentials to authenticate your app with an API key, end user
credential, or service account credential.
Authenticate your app for access: When your app runs, the registered
access credentials are evaluated. If your app is authenticating as an end
user, a sign-in prompt might be displayed.
Request resources: When your app needs access to Google resources, it
asks Google using the relevant scopes of access you previously registered.
Ask for user consent: If your app is authenticating as an end user,
Google displays the OAuth consent screen so the user can decide whether to
grant your app access to the requested data.
Send approved request for resources: If the user consents to the scopes
of access, your app bundles the credentials and the user-approved scopes of
access into a request. The request is sent to the Google authorization server
to obtain an access token.
Google returns an access token: The access token contains a list of
granted scopes of access. If the returned list of scopes is more limited than
the requested scopes of access, your app disables any features limited by the
token.
Access requested resources: Your app uses the access token from Google to
invoke the relevant APIs and access the resources.
Get a refresh token (optional): If your app needs access to a Google API
beyond the lifetime of a single access token, it can obtain a refresh token.
Request more resources: If additional access is needed, your app asks the
user to grant new scopes of access, resulting in a new request to get an
access token (steps 3–6).
Important terminology
The following list identifies terms related to authentication and authorization:
Authentication
The act of ensuring that a principal , which can be a user or an app acting
on behalf of a user, is who they say they are. When writing
Google Workspace apps, you should be aware of these types of
authentication:
User authentication
The act of a user authenticating (signing in) to your app. User
authentication is usually carried out through a sign-in process in which
the user uses a username and password combination to verify their identity
to the app. User authentication can be incorporated into an app using
Sign In With Google .
App authentication
The act of an app authenticating directly to Google services on behalf of
the user running the app. App authentication is usually carried out using
pre-created credentials in your app's code.
Authorization
The permissions or "authority" the principal has to access data or perform
operations. Your app requests authorization by informing the user that the app
wishes to act on their behalf. If the user allows the request, the app uses its
unique credentials to obtain an access token from Google.
Credential
A form of identification used in software security. In terms of
authentication, a credential is often a username and password combination. In
terms of authorization for Google Workspace APIs, a credential is
usually some form of identification, such as a unique secret string, known only
between the app developer and the authentication server. Google supports these
authentication credentials: API key, OAuth 2.0 Client ID, and service accounts.
API key
The credential used to request access to public data, such as data provided
using the Maps API. Public Google Workspace files shared using the
"Anyone on the Internet with this link" setting can also be accessed this way,
though most Google Workspace data requires OAuth 2.0.
OAuth 2 client ID
The credential used to request access to user-owned data. This is the
primary credential used when requesting access to data using
Google Workspace APIs. This credential requires user consent .
Client secret
A string of characters that should only be known by your application and the
authorization server. The client secret protects the user's data by only
granting tokens to authorized requesters. You should never include your
unencrypted client secret in your app. We recommend storing the client secret
securely. For more information, see
Handle client credentials securely .
Service account keys
Used by service accounts to gain authorization to a Google service.
Service account
A credential used for server-to-server interactions, such as an application
without a user interface that runs as a process to access data or perform
operations. Service accounts are usually used to access cloud-based data and
operations. However, when used with
domain-wide delegation of authority , they can be used to
access user data.
Scope
An OAuth 2.0 URI string that defines a level of access to resources or actions
granted to an app. For Google Workspace, authorization scope URIs
contain the Google Workspace app name, what kind of data it accesses,
and the level of access. Users of your app can review requested scopes and
choose what access to grant, then Google's authentication server returns
permitted scopes to your app in an access token . For more details, refer to
How to choose scopes for your app .
Authorization server
Google's server for granting access, using an access token , to an app's
requested data and operations.
Authorization code
A code sent from the authorization server used to obtain an access token. A
code is only needed when your application type is a web server app or an
installed app.
Access token
A token granting access to a Google Workspace API. A single access
token can grant varying degrees, known as scopes , of access to multiple APIs.
Your app's authorization code requests access tokens and uses them to invoke
Google Workspace APIs.
Resource server
The server hosting the API that your app wants to call.
OAuth 2.0 framework
A standard that your app can use to provide it with "secure delegated access"
or access to data and operations on behalf of the app's user. The authentication
and authorization mechanisms you use in your app represent your implementation
of the OAuth 2.0 framework .
Principal
An entity, also known as an identity, that can be granted access to a
resource. Google Workspace APIs support two types of principals: user
accounts and service accounts. For more details, refer to
Principals .
Data type
In the context of authentication and authorization, data type refers to the
entity that owns the data that your app is trying to access. There are three
data types:
Public domain data
Data accessible by anyone, such as some Google maps data. This data is
usually accessed using an API key.
End-user data
Data belonging to a specific end user or group, such as a specific user's
Google Drive files. This data type is usually accessed using an OAuth 2
client ID or service account.
Cloud data
Data owned by a Google Cloud project. This data type is usually accessed by
a service account.
User consent
An authorization step requiring the user of your app to authorize the app
to access data and perform operations on the user's behalf.
Application type
The type of app you are going to create. When creating credentials using
the Google Cloud console, you are asked to select your application type.
Application types are: Web application (JavaScript), Android, Chrome Extension,
iOS, TVs and Limited Input devices, and Desktop app (also called an "installed
app").
Service account
A special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user that
needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data. Your application assumes
the identity of the service account to call Google APIs, so that the users
aren't directly involved. By themselves, service accounts cannot be used
to access user data customarily accessed using Google Workspace APIs.
However, a service account can access user data by implementing domain-wide
delegation of authority. For more details, refer to
Understanding service accounts .
Domain-wide delegation of authority
An administration feature that can authorize an application to access user
data on behalf of users in the Google Workspace organization.
Domain-wide delegation can be used to perform admin-related tasks on user data.
To delegate authority this way, Google Workspace administrators use
service accounts with OAuth 2.0. Because of the power of this feature, only
super admins can enable domain-wide delegation of authority. For more details,
refer to
Delegating domain-wide authority to a service account .
Next step
Configure your app's OAuth consent screen
to ensure users can understand and approve what access your app has to their
data.
