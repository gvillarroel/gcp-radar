This guide explains how to reactivate a suspended Google Workspace subscription by resolving errors and calling the subscriptions.reactivate() method.
Subscriptions are suspended when an error prevents them from receiving events, such as issues with the target resource or notification endpoint.
You can identify the suspension reason by reviewing the subscription's suspensionReason field, which can be found in lifecycle events or using the subscriptions.get() method.
Once the error is resolved, you can reactivate the subscription using the provided Apps Script or Python code samples, allowing it to receive events again.
If reactivation fails, troubleshoot for additional errors by reviewing the output from the failed request, as multiple errors may be present.
This page explains how to reactivate a suspended Google Workspace
subscription by resolving or troubleshooting errors and calling the
subscriptions.reactivate
method.
Google Workspace subscriptions are suspended whenever an error prevents
the subscription from receiving events. For example, a subscription is suspended
when its target resource or notification endpoint can't be found. After you
resolve any errors with the subscription, you can reactivate the subscription to
start receiving events again.
Learn about a suspended subscription in the following ways:
Your app receives a lifecycle event
about the suspension. If your subscription is suspended due to an error with
its endpoint, you might not receive a lifecycle event.
Use the subscriptions.get or subscriptions.list methods to see
whether the subscription's state field is set to SUSPENDED .
You're notified about a delivery failure to your notification endpoint. To
learn about monitoring delivery failures to Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics, see
Handle message
failures .
Reactivated subscriptions maintain the original expiration date. To extend the
expiration time of a subscription, see
Update or renew a Google Workspace subscription .
Apps Script
A Google Workspace subscription. To create one,
see Create a subscription .
An Apps Script project:
Use your Google Cloud project instead of the default one created automatically by
Apps Script.
For all scopes that you added to configure the OAuth consent screen, you must also add the
scopes to the appsscript.json file in your Apps Script project.
For example, if you specified the chat.messages scope, then add the following:
"oauthScopes": [
"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages"
]
Enable
the Google Workspace Events advanced service.
Requires authentication and an appropriate authorization scope for each event type in the subscription:
For user authentication, requires one or more scopes that support at least one of the event types for the subscription. To identify a scope, see Scopes by event type .
Note: To run the code sample in this guide, you must use the same
OAuth
client ID credentials that you used to create the subscription.
For subscribing to a Chat event as a Chat app, requires app authentication with one-time administrator approval .
Python
Python 3.6 or greater
The pip package management tool
The latest Google client libraries for Python. To install or update them, run the following
command in your command-line interface:
pip3 install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib

Identify and resolve errors
To identify the error for a subscription, review the subscription's
suspensionReason field. You can find this field when you receive a lifecycle
event about the
suspension , or by using
the subscriptions.get method to review all fields for the subscription.
The following table displays possible errors for a subscription and, when
possible, how to resolve the errors. If you can't resolve the error, you can
delete the subscription , or wait
for it to expire. The Google Workspace Events API deletes expired
subscriptions automatically.
Error
Description
Ways to resolve
USER_SCOPE_REVOKED
The authorizing user has revoked the grant of one or more OAuth
scopes that are required for the subscription.
Obtain another access token. For details, see Obtain an access token from the
Google Authorization Server .
RESOURCE_DELETED
The target resource for the subscription is deleted.
If the resource is restored, call the reactivate
method. Otherwise, no action required, as you can't reactivate a
subscription without its original target resource.
USER_AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE
The authorizing user no longer has access to the resource for the
subscription.
No action required. You can't reactivate the subscription, as the
user who authorized it can't access the target resource.
ENDPOINT_PERMISSION_DENIED
The Google Workspace application doesn't have access to
deliver events to your notification endpoint.
Grant access to the service account for the Google Workspace
application that delivers events.
Service accounts:
Google Chat events : chat-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com
Google Drive events : drive-api-event-push@system.gserviceaccount.com
Google Meet events : meet-api-event-push@system.gserviceaccount.com
For Pub/Sub topics, grant the role of Pub/Sub Publisher ( roles/pubsub.publisher)
to the service account.
ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND
The notification endpoint doesn't exist or can't be found.
Check that the endpoint is still active and working. To troubleshoot
Pub/Sub topics, see the Troubleshooting
documentation .
ENDPOINT_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
The notification endpoint failed to receive events due to
insufficient quota or reaching rate limiting.
Request a quota increase.
APP_SCOPE_REVOKED
The domain administrator has revoked the grant of one or more OAuth
scopes for the Chat app.
Receive administrator approval .
APP_AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE
The Chat app that authorized the creation of the subscription no longer has
access to the subscription's target resource.
Regain access to the target resource. For example, if the target resource is a Chat space, the Chat app might need membership in the space.
Reactivate a subscription
After you've resolved the error that suspended your subscription, use
the reactivate method to let the subscription receive events again. The method
checks that all errors are resolved and changes your subscription's state
field from SUSPENDED to ACTIVE .
To reactivate a Google Workspace subscription:
Apps Script
In your Apps Script project, create a new script file
named reactivateSubscription and add the following code:
function reactivateSubscription () {
// The name of the subscription to reactivate.
const name = 'subscriptions/ SUBSCRIPTION_ID ' ;
// Call the Workspace Events API using the advanced service.
const response = WorkspaceEvents . Subscriptions . reactivate ({}, name );
console . log ( response );
}
Replace the following:
SUBSCRIPTION_ID : The ID of the subscription. To get the ID, you can use any of the following:
The value of the
uid field.
The ID of the resource name represented in the
name field. For example, if the resource name is
subscriptions/subscription-123 , use subscription-123 .
To reactivate the Google Workspace subscription, run the function
reactivateSubscription in your Apps Script project.
Python
In your working directory, create a file named reactivate_subscription.py
and add the following code:
"""Reactivate subscription."""
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
# Specify required scopes.
SCOPES = [ SCOPES ]
# Authenticate with Google Workspace and get user authentication.
flow = InstalledAppFlow . from_client_secrets_file ( 'credentials.json' , SCOPES )
CREDENTIALS = flow . run_local_server ()
# Call the Workspace Events API using the service endpoint.
service = build (
'workspaceevents' ,
'v1' ,
credentials = CREDENTIALS ,
)
NAME = 'subscriptions/ SUBSCRIPTION_ID '
response = service . subscriptions () . reactivate ( name = NAME ) . execute ()
print ( response )
Replace the following:
SCOPES : One or more OAuth scopes that support each event type
for the subscription. Formatted as an array of strings. To list multiple scopes, separate by commas.
For example, 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.readonly',
'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.memberships.readonly' .
SUBSCRIPTION_ID : The ID of the subscription. To get the ID, you can use any of the following:
The value of the
uid field.
The ID of the resource name represented in the
name field. For example, if the resource name is
subscriptions/subscription-123 , use subscription-123 .
In your working directory, make sure you've stored your OAuth client ID
credentials and named the file credentials.json . The code sample uses this JSON
file to authenticate with Google Workspace and get user credentials. For instructions,
see Create OAuth client ID
credentials .
To reactivate the Google Workspace subscription, run the following
in your terminal:
python3 reactivate_subscription.py
The Google Workspace Events API returns a
long-running operation that
contains the instance of the Subscription resource.
If the request fails, see the following section to troubleshoot additional
errors.
Reactivate a subscription as a Chat app
You can reactivate a subscription to Chat events as a
Chat app instead of as a user. The process is similar,
except:
Instead of user authentication,
authenticate as a Chat app with one-time administrator approval .
Specify authorization scopes that allow the
Chat app to subscribe to Chat
events. These authorization scopes always begin with chat.app , and
include the following:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.memberships :
Subscribe to Chat space member events.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.memberships.readonly :
Subscribe to Chat space member events.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.messages.readonly :
Subscribe to Chat space message and reaction events.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.spaces :
Subscribe to Chat space events.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.spaces.readonly :
Subscribe to Chat space events.
Write a script that calls Google Workspace Events API
The following code sample reactivates a Chat app's
Google Workspace subscription:
Python
"""Reactivate subscription."""
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from apiclient.discovery import build
# Specify required scopes.
SCOPES = [ SCOPES ]
# Specify service account details.
CREDENTIALS = (
service_account . Credentials . from_service_account_file ( 'credentials.json' )
. with_scopes ( SCOPES )
)
# Call the Workspace Events API using the service endpoint.
service = build (
'workspaceevents' ,
'v1beta' ,
credentials = CREDENTIALS ,
)
NAME = 'subscriptions/ SUBSCRIPTION_ID '
response = service . subscriptions () . reactivate ( name = NAME ) . execute ()
print ( response )
Replace the following:
SCOPES : Specify authorization scopes that allow the
Chat app to subscribe to Chat
events. These authorization scopes always begin with chat.app , and
include the following:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.memberships :
Subscribe to Chat space member events.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.memberships.readonly :
Subscribe to Chat space member events.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.messages.readonly :
Subscribe to Chat space message and reaction events.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.spaces :
Subscribe to Chat space events.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.spaces.readonly :
Subscribe to Chat space events.
SUBSCRIPTION_ID : The ID of the subscription. To get the ID, you can use any of the following:
The value of the
uid field.
The ID of the resource name represented in the
name field. For example, if the resource name is
subscriptions/subscription-123 , use subscription-123 .
Troubleshoot multiple errors
If you have resolved the error that suspended the subscription and the
reactivate method fails, another error might have occurred after your
subscription was suspended.
To identify additional errors, review the output from the failed request. The
output contains any errors that are still present.
When your subscription has multiple errors, the value for the suspensionReason
field always uses the original error that suspended your subscription.
