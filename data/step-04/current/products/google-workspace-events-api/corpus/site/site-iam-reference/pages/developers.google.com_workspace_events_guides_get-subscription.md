Page Summary
outlined_flag
This page provides instructions for retrieving details about a Google Workspace subscription using the subscriptions.get() method.
You can get details about user-authorized subscriptions using user authentication or any subscription for the app using app authentication.
Code samples are provided in Apps Script and Python demonstrating how to retrieve subscription details.
Prerequisites include a Google Workspace subscription, proper authentication, and specific environment setups for Apps Script and Python.
Related topics cover subscription management tasks like updating, resolving errors, deleting, listing, and creating subscriptions.
This page explains how to get details about a Google Workspace
subscription using the
subscriptions.get()
method.
When you call this method with user authentication, the method returns
details about a subscription authorized by the user. When you use app
authentication, the method can return details about any subscription for the
app.
Prerequisites
Apps Script
A Google Workspace subscription. To create one,
see Create a subscription .
An Apps Script project:
Use your Google Cloud project instead of the default one created automatically by
Apps Script.
For all scopes that you added to configure the OAuth consent screen, you must also add the
scopes to the appsscript.json file in your Apps Script project.
For example, if you specified the chat.messages scope, then add the following:
"oauthScopes": [
"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages"
]
Enable
the Google Workspace Events advanced service.
Requires authentication and an appropriate authorization scope for each event type in the subscription:
For user authentication, requires a
scope that supports at least one of the event types for the subscription. To identify a scope, see Scopes by event type .
Note: To run the code sample in this guide, you must use the same
OAuth
client ID credentials that you used to create the subscription.
For app authentication, requires the chat.bot scope (Google Chat apps only).
Python
Python 3.6 or greater
The pip package management tool
The latest Google client libraries for Python. To install or update them, run the following
command in your command-line interface:
pip3 install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib
A Google Workspace subscription. To create one,
see Create a subscription .
Requires authentication and an appropriate authorization scope for each event type in the subscription:
For user authentication, requires a
scope that supports at least one of the event types for the subscription. To identify a scope, see Scopes by event type .
Note: To run the code sample in this guide, you must use the same
OAuth
client ID credentials that you used to create the subscription.
For app authentication, requires the chat.bot scope (Google Chat apps only).
Get a subscription authorized by a user
The following code sample gets details about a
Subscription resource
using user authentication. When authenticated as a user, the method returns a
subscription that the user authorized the app to create.
To get a subscription authorized by a user:
Apps Script
In your Apps Script project, create a new script file
named getSubscription and add the following code:
function getSubscription () {
// The name of the subscription to get.
const name = 'subscriptions/ SUBSCRIPTION_ID ' ;
// Call the Workspace Events API using the advanced service.
const subscription = WorkspaceEvents . Subscriptions . get ( name );
console . log ( subscription );
}
Replace the following:
SUBSCRIPTION_ID : The ID of the subscription. To get the ID, you can use any of the following:
The value of the
uid field.
The ID of the resource name represented in the
name field. For example, if the resource name is
subscriptions/subscription-123 , use subscription-123 .
To get the subscription, run the function getSubscription in
your Apps Script project.
Python
In your working directory, create a file named get_subscription.py
and add the following code:
"""Get subscription."""
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
# Specify required scopes.
SCOPES = [ ' SCOPE ' ]
# Authenticate with Google Workspace and get user authentication.
flow = InstalledAppFlow . from_client_secrets_file ( 'credentials.json' , SCOPES )
CREDENTIALS = flow . run_local_server ()
# Call the Workspace Events API using the service endpoint.
service = build (
'workspaceevents' ,
'v1' ,
credentials = CREDENTIALS ,
)
NAME = 'subscriptions/ SUBSCRIPTION_ID '
subscription = service . subscriptions () . get ( name = NAME ) . execute ()
print ( subscription )
Replace the following:
SCOPE : An OAuth scope that supports at least
one event type from the subscription . For example, if your subscription receives events
an updated Chat space, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.readonly .
SUBSCRIPTION_ID : The ID of the subscription. To get the ID, you can use any of the following:
The value of the
uid field.
The ID of the resource name represented in the
name field. For example, if the resource name is
subscriptions/subscription-123 , use subscription-123 .
In your working directory, make sure you've stored your OAuth client ID
credentials and named the file credentials.json . The code sample uses this JSON
file to authenticate with Google Workspace and get user credentials. For instructions,
see Create OAuth client ID
credentials .
To get the subscription, run the following in your terminal:
python3 get_subscription.py
