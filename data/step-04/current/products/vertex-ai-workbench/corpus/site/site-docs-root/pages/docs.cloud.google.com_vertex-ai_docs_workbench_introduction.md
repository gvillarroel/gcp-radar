Introduction to Vertex AI Workbench
Vertex AI Workbench instances are Jupyter notebook-based development environments
for the entire data science workflow. You can interact with
Vertex AI and other Google Cloud services from within
a Vertex AI Workbench instance's Jupyter notebook.
Vertex AI Workbench integrations and features can make it easier
to access your data, process data faster, schedule notebook runs, and more.
Vertex AI Workbench instances are prepackaged with
JupyterLab
and have a preinstalled suite of deep learning packages,
including support for the TensorFlow and PyTorch
frameworks. You can configure either CPU-only or GPU-enabled instances.
Vertex AI Workbench instances support the ability to sync with a
GitHub repository.
Vertex AI Workbench instances are protected
by Google Cloud authentication and authorization.
Access to data
You can access your data without leaving the JupyterLab user interface.
In JupyterLab's navigation menu on a Vertex AI Workbench instance,
you can use the Cloud Storage integration
to browse data and other files that you have access to.
See Access Cloud Storage buckets and files
from within JupyterLab .
You can also use the BigQuery integration
to browse tables that you have access to, write queries, preview results,
and load data into your notebook. See Query data in BigQuery
tables from within JupyterLab .
Execute notebook runs
Use the executor to run a notebook file as a one-time execution or
on a schedule. Choose the specific environment and hardware that you want
your execution to run on. Your notebook's code will run on
Vertex AI custom training, which can make it easier
to do distributed training, optimize hyperparameters, or
schedule continuous training jobs.
You can use parameters in your execution to make specific changes to each run.
For example, you might specify a different dataset to use,
change the learning rate on your model, or change the version of the model.
You can also set a notebook to run on a recurring schedule. Even while your
instance is shut down, Vertex AI Workbench will run your notebook file and
save the results for you to look at and share with others. See
Schedule a notebook run .
Share insights
Executed notebook runs are stored in a Cloud Storage bucket,
so you can share your insights with others by granting access
to the results. See the previous section on executing
notebook runs .
Secure your instance
The following sections describe supported capabilities that can help you
secure your Vertex AI Workbench instance.
VPC
You can deploy your Vertex AI Workbench instance
with the default Google-managed network,
which uses a default VPC network and subnet.
Instead of the default network, you can specify a
VPC network to use with your instance.
To use Vertex AI Workbench within a service perimeter, see
Use a Vertex AI Workbench instance within a service
perimeter .
Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
By default, Google Cloud automatically encrypts data when it is at
rest using encryption keys
managed by Google. If you have specific compliance or regulatory requirements
related to the keys that protect your data, you can use customer-managed
encryption keys (CMEK) with your Vertex AI Workbench instances.
For more information,
see Customer-managed encryption keys .
Confidential Computing
You can encrypt your data-in-use by using Confidential Computing. To use
Confidential Computing, you enable the Confidential VM service
when you create a Vertex AI Workbench instance. To get started,
see Create an instance with
Confidential Computing .
Automated shutdown for idle instances
To help manage costs, Vertex AI Workbench instances shut down after
being idle for a specific time period by default. You can change the
amount of time or turn this feature off. For more information,
see Idle shutdown .
Add conda environments
Vertex AI Workbench instances use
kernels
based on conda environments. You can add a conda environment to
your Vertex AI Workbench instance, and the environment appears as
a kernel in your instance's JupyterLab interface.
Adding conda environments lets you use kernels that aren't available in the
default Vertex AI Workbench instance.
For example, you can add conda environments for R and Apache Beam. Or you
can add conda environments for specific earlier versions of the available
frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Python.
For more information, see
Add a conda environment .
Custom containers
You can create a Vertex AI Workbench instance based on a custom container.
Start with a Google-provided base container image, and modify it for
your needs. Then create an instance based on your custom container.
For more information, see Create an instance using a
custom container .
Managed Service for Apache Spark integration
You can process data quickly by running a notebook on
a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster. After your cluster is set up, you can run
a notebook file on it without leaving the JupyterLab user interface.
For more information, see Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark-enabled
instance .
Reserve VM resources
Use
Compute Engine reservations
to gain a high level of assurance that your Vertex AI Workbench instances
have enough virtual machine (VM) resources to run.
Reservations are a Compute Engine feature. They help make sure that
you have the resources available to create VMs with the same hardware
(memory and vCPUs) and optional resources (GPUs and Local SSD disks)
whenever you need them.
For more information, see
Use reservations .
Create instances with third party credentials
You can create and manage Vertex AI Workbench instances with
third party credentials provided by Workforce Identity Federation.
Workforce Identity Federation uses your external identity provider (IdP)
to grant a group of users access to Vertex AI Workbench instances
through a proxy.
Access to a Vertex AI Workbench instance is granted by assigning a
workforce pool principal
to the Vertex AI Workbench instance's service account.
For more information, see Create an instance with
third party credentials .
Tags for Vertex AI Workbench instances
The underlying VM of a Vertex AI Workbench instance is a
Compute Engine VM. You can add and manage resource tags to your
Vertex AI Workbench instance through its Compute Engine VM.
When you create a Vertex AI Workbench instance,
Vertex AI Workbench attaches the Compute Engine resource tag
vertex-workbench-instances:prod=READ_ONLY . This resource tag is
only used for internal purposes.
To learn more about managing tags for Compute Engine instances,
see Manage tags for resources .
Limitations
Consider the following limitations of
Vertex AI Workbench instances when planning your project:
Third party JupyterLab extensions aren't supported.
When you use
Access Context Manager
and Chrome Enterprise Premium
to protect Vertex AI Workbench instances with context-aware
access controls, access is evaluated each time the user authenticates
to the instance. For example, access is evaluated the first time
the user accesses JupyterLab and whenever they access it thereafter
if their web browser's cookie has expired.
Using a custom container that isn't derived from the
Google-provided base container
( gcr.io/deeplearning-platform-release/workbench-container:latest )
increases the risks of compatibility issues with our services and
isn't supported. Instead, modify the base container to create a
custom container that meets your needs, and then create an instance using
the custom container .
Vertex AI Workbench instances expect images from the
cloud-notebooks-managed project. The list of image names is available at
the creation page in the Google Cloud console. Although the use of custom
virtual machine (VM) images or
Deep Learning VM
images with Vertex AI Workbench instances can be possible,
Vertex AI Workbench doesn't provide any support for unexpected
behaviors or malfunctions when using those images.
The use of a user-managed notebooks image or
managed notebooks image to create a
Vertex AI Workbench instance isn't supported.
You can't edit the underlying VM of a Vertex AI Workbench instance
by using the Google Cloud console or the Compute Engine API. To edit a
Vertex AI Workbench instance's underlying VM, use the
projects.locations.instances.patch
method in the Notebooks API or the
gcloud workbench instances update
command in the Google Cloud SDK.
In instances that use VPC Service Controls, use of the
executor isn't
supported.
To use accelerators with Vertex AI Workbench instances,
the accelerator type that you want must be available in your instance's
zone. To learn about accelerator availability by zone, see
GPU regions and zones availability .
