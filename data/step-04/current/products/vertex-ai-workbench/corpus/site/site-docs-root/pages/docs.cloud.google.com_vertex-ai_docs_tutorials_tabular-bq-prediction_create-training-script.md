Create a training script
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
To create a custom model, you need a Python training script that creates and
trains the custom model. You initialize your training job with the Python
training script, then invoke the training job's
run
method to run the script.
In this topic, you create the training script, then specify command arguments
for your training script.
Create a training script
In this section, you create a training script. This script is a new file in your
notebook environment named task.py . Later in this tutorial, you pass this
script to the aiplatform.CustomTrainingJob constructor. When the script runs, it does the following:
Loads the data in the BigQuery dataset you created.
Uses the
TensorFlow Keras API to
build, compile, and train your model.
Specifies the number of epochs and the batch size to use when the Keras
Model.fit
method is invoked.
Specifies where to save model artifacts using the AIP_MODEL_DIR environment
variable. AIP_MODEL_DIR is set by Vertex AI and contains the URI of a
directory for saving model artifacts. For more information, see Environment
variables for special Cloud Storage
directories .
Exports a TensorFlow
SavedModel to
the model directory. For more information, see Using the SavedModel
format
on the TensorFlow website.
To create your training script, run the following code in your notebook:
%% writefile task . py
import argparse
import numpy as np
import os
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from google.cloud import bigquery

After you create the script, it appears in the root folder of your notebook:
Define arguments for your training script
You pass the following command-line arguments to your training script:
label_column - This identifies the column in your data that contains what
you want to predict. In this case, that column is species . You defined this
in a variable named LABEL_COLUMN when you processed your data. For more
information, see
Download, preprocess, and split the data .
epochs - This is the number of epochs used when you train your model. An
epoch is an iteration over the data when training your model. This tutorial
uses 20 epochs.
batch_size - This is the number of samples that are processed before your
model updates. This tutorial uses a batch size of 10.
To define the arguments that are passed to your script, run the following code:
JOB_NAME = "custom_job_unique"
EPOCHS = 20
BATCH_SIZE = 10
CMDARGS = [
"--label_column=" + LABEL_COLUMN,
"--epochs=" + str(EPOCHS),
"--batch_size=" + str(BATCH_SIZE),
]
