Managing long-running operations (LROs)
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Long-Running Operations are returned by batch
processing method calls because they take a longer time to complete than is appropriate
for an API response. This is so the calling thread is not held open while many
documents are processed. The Document AI API creates an LRO every time you
call projects.locations.processors.batchProcess
through the API or Client Libraries. The LRO tracks the status of the processing job.
You can use the operations methods
that the Document AI API provides to check the
status of LROs. You can
also list , poll ,
or cancel LROs. Client libraries calling
async method poll internally, enabling callback. (For Python, await is enabled.) They also
feature a timeout parameter. Within the main LRO returned by .batchProcess, an LRO
is created for each document (because batch page-count limits are much higher than
the sync process call and can take significant time to process). When the main
LRO ends, the detailed status of each document LRO is provided.
LROs are managed at the Google Cloud project and location level.
When making a request to the API, include the Google Cloud project
and the location in which the LRO is running.
The record of an LRO is kept for approximately 30 days after the LRO
finishes, meaning that you cannot view or list an LRO after that point.
Getting details about a long-running operation
The following samples show how to get details about an LRO.
REST
To get the status of and view details about an LRO, call the projects.locations.operations.get method.
Suppose that you receive the following response after calling
projects.locations.processors.batchProcess :
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID "
}
The name value in the response shows that the Document AI API
created an LRO named projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID .
You can also retrieve the LRO name by listing long-running operations .
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : the location where the LRO is running, for example:
us - United States
eu - European Union
OPERATION_ID : The ID of your operation. The ID is the last element of the name
of your operation. For example:
Operation name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ bc4e1d412863e626
Operation id: bc4e1d412863e626
HTTP method and URL:
GET https:// LOCATION -documentai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ "https:// LOCATION -documentai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID "
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method GET ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https:// LOCATION -documentai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID " | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"name": "projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID ",
"metadata": {
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.documentai.v1.BatchProcessMetadata",

Polling a long-running operation
The following samples show how to poll the status of an LRO.
REST
To poll an LRO, repeatedly call the projects.locations.operations.get
method until the operation finishes. Use a backoff between each poll request,
such as 10 seconds.
Before using any of the request data below, make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : your Google Cloud project ID
LOCATION : the location where the LRO is running
OPERATION_ID : the identifier for the LRO
HTTP method and URL:
GET https:// LOCATION -documentai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID
To send your request, choose one of these options:
Note: If you are not executing the commands below from Cloud Shell or
Compute Engine , ensure you have set the
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
environment variable to your service account private key file path.
curl
Execute the following command to poll for the status of an LRO every 10 seconds:
while true ; \
do curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer " $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) \
"https:// LOCATION -documentai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID " ; \
sleep 10 ; \
done
You should receive a JSON response every 10 seconds.
While the operation is running, the response will contain "state": "RUNNING" .
When the operation finishes, the response will contain "state": "SUCCEEDED" and "done": true .
Response
{

Note: The code is a generic function designed for polling an LRO to check the
status of single or multiple batch_process jobs. In cases where you want to wait
until the batch_process_documents operation is completed fully, client libraries
offer their own polling methods. Refer to Batch processing
for more information.
Cancelling a long-running operation
The following samples show how to cancel an LRO while it is running.
REST
To cancel an LRO, call the projects.locations.operations.cancel method.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project ID.
LOCATION : the location where the LRO is running, for example:
us - United States
eu - European Union
OPERATION_ID : The ID of your operation. The ID is the last element of the name
of your operation. For example:
Operation name: projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ bc4e1d412863e626
Operation id: bc4e1d412863e626
HTTP method and URL:
POST https:// LOCATION -documentai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID :cancel
To send your request, choose one of these options:
curl
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d "" \ "https:// LOCATION -documentai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID :cancel"
PowerShell
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https:// LOCATION -documentai.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID :cancel" | Select-Object -Expand Content
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{}
If you attempt to cancel an operation that has already completed, you should receive the following error message:
"error" : {
"code" : 400 ,
"message" : "Operation has completed and cannot be cancelled: ' PROJECT_ID /locations/ LOCATION /operations/ OPERATION_ID '." ,
"status" : "FAILED_PRECONDITION"
