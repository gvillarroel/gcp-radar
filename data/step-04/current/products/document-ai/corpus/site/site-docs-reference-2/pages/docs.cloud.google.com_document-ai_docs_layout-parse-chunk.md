Process documents with Gemini layout parser
The Document AI layout parser is an advanced text parsing and
document understanding service that converts unstructured content from complex
files into highly structured, precise and machine-readable information. It combines
Google's specialized Object Character Recognition (OCR) models with the generative
AI capabilities of Gemini. It understands the complete document
structure, identifying elements like tables, figures, lists, and headers while
preserving the contextual relationships between them, such as which paragraphs
belong to which heading.
It's designed to solve a critical problem for Search and Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG): standard OCR flattens documents,
destroying the very context and structure that adds valuable meaning, like headings,
tables, and lists.
Primary use cases
Document OCR: It can parse text and layout elements like heading, header,
footer, table structure and figures from PDF documents.
High-Fidelity Search & RAG: Its primary use is to prepare documents for Search
and RAG pipelines. By creating context-aware chunks, it dramatically improves
retrieval quality and the accuracy of generated answers.
Structured Data Ingestion: It can parse complex documents (like 10-K filings
or reports) and index structured content (like parsed tables or image descriptions)
into databases, as demonstrated with BigQuery .
How it Works
Gemini layout parser processes documents in a multi-stage pipeline
designed to preserve semantic meaning:
Parse and Structure: The document is ingested. All elements are identified and
organized into a tree format. This
DocumentLayout proto field
preserves the document's inherent hierarchy.
Annotate and Verbalize: Preview
Gemini's generative capabilities are used to verbalize complex visual
elements. Figures, charts, and tables are annotated with rich, textual descriptions.
Chunk and Augment: The parsed document and its annotations are used to create
semantically coherent chunks. These chunks are augmented with contextual
information, such as their ancestral headings, to ensure that the chunk's meaning
is preserved even when retrieved in isolation.

Key capabilities
Going forward in this documentation, Gemini layout parser
refers to Gemini based pretrained layout parser processor
versions, such as pretrained-layout-parser-v1.5-2025-08-25 and
pretrained-layout-parser-v1.5-pro-2025-08-25 . Gemini layout parser supports the following key capabilities.
Advanced table parsing
Tables in financial reports or technical manuals are a common failure point for
RAG. Gemini layout parser excels at extracting data from complex tables
with merged cells and intricate headers.
Example: In this Alphabet 10-K filing, a competitor's parser fails to correctly
align headers and cells, misinterpreting the financial data. Gemini
layout parser accurately parses the entire table structure, preserving the data's
integrity.
Figure 1. The source of this input document is " Alphabet 2024
SEC Form 10-K ",
page 72.
Competitor parser doesn't properly detect cell and column alignment and
hallucinates values.
Gemini layout parser aligns columns correctly, and provides accurate
values.
Reduced hallucinations
Unlike pure LLM-based parsers that try to read text that isn't there, Gemini
layout parser's foundation in advanced OCR grounds it in the document's actual
content. This leads to significantly fewer hallucinations.
Example: In this 10-K excerpt, a competitor model hallucinates and inserts incorrect
text. Gemini layout parser provides a clean, accurate extraction of
only the text present on the page.
Figure 2. Input Document (Alphabet 2024 10k p75)
Competitor models will hallucinate values.
Gemini layout parser correctly identifies values in images and tables.
Layout-aware chunking
Standard parsers often create chunks removed from their original context,
separating a paragraph from its heading. Gemini layout parser understands
the document's hierarchy. It creates context-aware chunks that include content
from ancestral headings and table headers. A retrieved chunk contains
not just the text, but also the structural context needed for an accurate LLM
response.
Figure 3. The source of this image is from " Hierarchical Text Spotter for
Joint Text Spotting and Layout Analysis ", by
Shangbang Long, Siyang Qin, Yasuhisa Fujii, Alessandro Bissacco, and Michalis
Raptis.
Layout annotation
Layout parser annotation is in Preview . It can identify if there are images or tables in parsed documents. When found,
they're annotated as a descriptive block of text with the information depicted
in the image and table.
For example, when processing a bank report, the parser doesn't just
see an image. It generates a detailed description and extracts the data points
from all three pie charts, making that data available for retrieval.
Figure 4. The source of this input is a saved PDF of " The CREATE MODEL statement for ARIMA_
PLUS_XREG models "
on the Google Cloud site.
This diagram illustrates a two-phase machine learning pipeline for time series
forecasting: "CREATE MODEL" and "ML.FORECAST".
**CREATE MODEL Phase:**
* **Input Data:** The process begins with multivariate time series (target +
covariates).
* **Covariates Preprocess:** The covariates from the multivariate time series
undergo covariates preprocess.
* **Linear Regression:** The preprocessed covariates are fed into a linear
regression model. The output of this step is non-covariates time series.
* **ARIMA_PLUS pipeline:** The "Non-covariates time series" then enters an
"ARIMA_PLUS pipeline".
* **Outputs of CREATE MODEL:** The results from the ARIMA_PLUS pipeline, along
with data from the linear regression step, generate three outputs: covariates
weights, evaluation metrics and model coefficients and forecasted time series
(non-covariates).
**ML.FORECAST Phase:**
* **Input Data:** This phase starts with "Multivariate time series (covariates)".
* **Covariates Preprocess:**
* **Linear Prediction:** The preprocessed covariates are fed into a linear
prediction step.
* **Aggregation:** The covariates (predicted contribution from covariates)
are then combined with the forecasted time series (non-covariates) obtained
from the CREATE MODEL phase.
* **Final Output:** The result of the aggregation is the forecasted time
series, which is the final prediction of the target variable.
**Overall Flow:**
The diagram shows a two-stage forecasting approach. In the CREATE MODEL stage,
a model is built to separate the target time series into components influenced
by covariates and components that are not. The non-covariate component is then
processed and forecasted using an ARIMA_PLUS pipeline. The covariate component's
relationship with the target is captured by linear regression weights. In the
ML.FORECAST stage, these learned components are combined with future covariate
data to produce a final forecast.
