Date and Currency Normalization for custom extractor
With this release, the model will deduce the region information from the document and use it to disambiguate the date and currency formats in the following ways:
This release will enable the support of region based date and currency normalization of entities with datetime and currency data types in Custom Document Extractor (CDE) Generative AI based processor versions v1.1 and v1.2.
Currently CDE Generative AI based processor supports date and currency normalization but it defaults to US date format and USD respectively in case the values are ambiguous. In other words, if a date can be parsed in mm/dd/yyyy and dd/mm/yyyy formats, it will use mm/dd/yyyy format for normalization. Similarly if $ can be mean USD or CAD, it would default to USD.

v1beta3
Issue
Known issue (Document Labeling)
If you delete one or more documents, and these documents selected for deletion are all associated with an active labeling job, then all documents in that dataset will also be deleted, even if you did not select them for deletion. This is true regardless of the number of documents selected.
Workaround: Do not delete documents during an active labeling job. You can track active labeling jobs on the Dataset management page, under the category Labeling tasks , located on the right side of the page. If you absolutely must delete documents during an active labeling job, ensure that you also select at least one document that is NOT part of this active labeling job. Then, only the non-associated documents will be deleted, and the remaining documents in the dataset will be preserved.

v1beta3
Issue
Known issues
During labeling, checkboxes default to a state that does not reflect the selected or unselected states in the corresponding documents.
Workaround: Label all checkboxes within a schema, regardless of whether they are selected or unselected, for optimal checkbox extraction quality and accurate evaluation. When annotating a checkbox by drawing its bounding box, all checkboxes in the CDE annotation user interface will default to an unselected state, and you must manually update the selected or unselected state as necessary.
If a processor is deleted when there is an active labeling task ongoing, the task does not stop automatically. Labelers and Labeler Managers will still see the task in their labeling and manager consoles.
Workaround: Cancel the active labeling task before you delete the processor. Otherwise, navigate to the manager console to pause or delete the corresponding task queue. Any documents labeled from that task after the processor is deleted will be unretrievable.
Some discrepancies might exist between pretrained and uptrained versions of a processor.
On the Evaluate & Test tab, the evaluation does not show as complete until you click Refresh Table .
If you cannot choose a specialist pool due to no chooser for the specialists, clicking Continue causes an error.
Workaround: Click Task Details to go back and fill in remaining details.
Support for nested entities is limited to data arranged in a tabular format. Other layouts are currently not supported.
Any mention of "nested entities" in previous versions of the Document AI Workbench documentation have been replaced with "tabular entities" to reflect the table-based nesting capabilities for this launch.
If you see this message, "This processor does not currently support uptraining or evaluation capabilities" on a processor in the Processor gallery , this means that only the prediction endpoint is available at this time.
In some cases, required_once and optional_once entities appear multiple times in a document, with the same value copied to multiple locations. While one annotation is s sufficient when annotating a test set for evaluation, all copies should be annotated to ensure higher recall for trained models.
Workaround: Annotate all instances of an entity within a doc. This will support both Evaluation and Training without any infrastructure changes.
Existing Human in the Loop (HITL) configurations for Label-level filters do not automatically populate to new processor configurations.
Workaround: If you require changes to the configuration, navigate to the Human-In-The-Loop tab. Under Set filters , select Label-level filters and click Set Label Filters . A Label-level filters page opens. Manually edit this table to configure all of the labels needed for validation and review.
Support for handwritten entity detection such as signatures, dates, and initials are limited and may require additional configuration for proper evaluation.
Workaround: When evaluating pretrained processors, the Value should be manually updated to YES if the entity is present, or NO otherwise. For uptrained processor versions, the Value should be kept as detected by OCR. This issue affects W9, HUD92900B, SSA-1099, and VBA26-0551 processors.
When you attempt to select a specialist pool for a labeling task, and there are missing fields in the form, and then click Continue , you might get an error.
Workaround: Click Task Details , and enter the missing details in the form. You can then successfully create a labeling task.

v1beta3
Feature
Schema support for checkboxes and nested entitites
Customers using Document AI Workbench, and processors for Purchase Order (PO), Invoice, or Expense, now have access to a new schema. This schema enables customers to label checkboxes, if they are defined in the schema, and to accurately represent nested entities, such as parent-child relationships, on the HITL annotation and review console. As additional processors adapt the new schema, these release notes will be updated to include those.
Nested entities
The Annotation console now supports labeling for nested entities. The left panel is refreshed with a new look for nested rows to represent nested entities. The value of "parent" will now be the concatenation of all its "children". The parent is effectively a container for all of its children.
