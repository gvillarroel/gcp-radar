This page describes common issues that you might encounter while
using Cloud Domains and how to resolve them.
Domain registration issues
This section lists some issues that you might encounter when registering your
domain.
The searchDomains API call shows a domain name as available, but retrieveRegisterParameters shows it is not
The searchDomains call checks a large space of possible domain names to
provide suggestions. It relies on an
availability cache that might be incomplete or out of date. The
retrieveRegisterParameters call, on the other hand, deals with only one domain
name at a time and provides up-to-date domain name availability
information.
You cannot use preferred contact privacy mode with the domain you are trying to register
The available contact privacy modes depend on the ending of the domain name that
you choose. Domain endings are administered by many different partner registries,
and some of these have unique behavior and requirements. For example, some domain
endings don't allow contact privacy at all, and others redact certain parts of
your contact information from the public WHOIS registry. Prior to registration,
refer to the supportedPrivacy field in the output of
retrieveRegisterParameters to determine which contact privacy modes are
supported for a given domain name. After registration, the supported contact
privacy modes are listed in the supportedPrivacy field of the registration
resource.
During registration, a registration resource seems to be stuck in state: REGISTRATION_PENDING
The REGISTRATION_PENDING state should be short-lived, in the order of a few
minutes in most cases, before transitioning to ACTIVE . If a registration is
pending for more than a few hours, contact Google Cloud support .
During registration, a registration resource ends up in state: REGISTRATION_FAILED
When a domain registration fails, you can call retrieveRegisterParameters again
to check whether the domain is still available. If it is, you can delete your
registration and try to register again.
There are also a number of common data-quality issues that can cause your domain
registration to fail. For example, if you are setting custom name servers when
registering the domain, they might not be recognized as registered name servers
by the controlling registry . To
complete your registration, you can temporarily set your DNS provider to
Cloud DNS and change it after registration.
For details about the errors that you might receive during
domain registration, see Errors during domain
registration .
If the problem persists, contact Google Cloud support .
You are getting a Quota exceeded error while trying to register a domain
You might have exceeded the quota for the number of registered domains. For
detailed information about quotas, see the Quotas page.
Registrant email verification issues
This section lists some issues that you might encounter when verifying your email
address after registering a domain.
After registering a domain, you don't get a verification email
If you used the same registrant email address before with another domain name,
you might not need to verify the address again. You can check your verification
status directly on the registration resource, which shows UNVERIFIED_EMAIL
in the issue field if your verification is pending. You can trigger a resend
of the verification email on the Cloud Domains
Registration details page.
Why must you verify your email address after registering a domain?
When you register a domain, Google requires you to verify your email address.
You receive an email with instructions to complete the verification. If you fail
to verify your email address within 15 days of registration, your domain is
suspended.
You no longer have access to your verified email address
If the registrant email address is inaccessible by the named registratant, or if
you don't have access to the registrant email address,
contact Cloud Customer Care .
Your domain got suspended due to lack of email verification
If your domain is suspended due to lack of email verification, your registration
resource will be in state: SUSPENDED , and the issue field will contain
UNVERIFIED_EMAIL . In this case, trigger a resend of the verification email
on the Cloud Domains Registration details page, and then follow
the instructions in that email to complete email verification. After verification
is completed, your domain's suspension is automatically lifted.
Contact configuration issues
This section lists some issues that you might encounter when configuring your
contact information.
Changes to your contact configuration are not taking effect
Due to Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requirements,
many types of contact changes require confirmation from both the previous
registrant and the new registrant. While changes that you made are awaiting such
confirmation, they are temporarily listed in the pendingContactSettings field
of the registration resource. To confirm pending changes, the earlier and new
registrants must follow the confirmation instructions that they receive.
To resend change confirmations that might have been lost, trigger a resend
of the verification email on the Cloud Domains
Registration details page.
You are listed as the registrant contact, but have lost access to your domain
Registrants are considered to be the rightful owners of a domain
registration. If you are listed as the registrant contact but have lost access
to the domain, contact Customer Care .
You deleted a project and lost access to your domain
If you delete the project that contains your Registration resource, you lose
access to the domain. You have a few recovery options. If you deleted the
project recently, you can restore
the project ,
and then you can transfer a registered domain to another registrar .
If you cannot restore your project, the registrant contact can reach out to
Google Cloud support to gain access to the domain.
Contact details while registering or transferring a domain for a company
When registering a domain that is owned by a company, the registrant must provide
the company's contact details such as email address and phone number.
If the registrant provides their personal contact details, the company might lose
access to the domain when the registrant leaves.
DNS configuration issues
This section lists some issues that you might encounter when configuring DNS
settings.
You made changes to your DNS configuration but the changes are not taking effect
Due to the nature of DNS as a distributed system, changes to DNS configurations
often take a while to propagate to the entire internet. This is because DNS
resolvers anywhere in the world can cache your earlier configuration for a
length of time equal to the TTL of that record. Thus, it might take the full
duration of the previously configured TTL for your new configuration to become
fully visible. For Cloud Domains, changes to the DNS provider or
name servers and changes related to DNSSEC can often take
up to a day to become fully visible across the internet.
You published DS records and now your domain is not resolving
Publishing DS records is the last step in enabling DNSSEC for your domain. To
ensure that your domain continues to resolve, DS records should generally be
removed a day or two before changing your name servers or DNS provider.
Similarly, new DS records should be published no sooner than a day or two after
completing a name server or DNS provider change.
If problems resolving your domain coincide with changes to DS records, it
means that your DNS domain provider has not properly signed your domain's DNS
configuration. You can remove the DS records to see if that fixes the problem.
However, like any other DNS change, removing the DS records can take some time
(up to the TTL of the removed records) to take effect.
You chose Google Domains as your DNS provider, but cannot see your zone in Cloud DNS
Caution: Google Domains as your Domain Name System (DNS) provider for your domains in Cloud Domains is retired, and some DNS functionality from Cloud Domains is no longer supported. For more information, see Cloud Domains feature deprecation .
Choosing Google Domains as your free DNS provider means that you must manage
your DNS configuration by using the Google Domains website. These DNS
configurations are not visible in the Cloud DNS product and don't
provide API access for configuration. If you require API access, create a zone
in Cloud DNS and configure your domain to use that zone.
Note: You are billed separately for the Cloud DNS service.

Domain transfer issues to and from other registrars
Caution: Transferring a registered domain from a third-party domain registrar to Cloud Domains is deprecated and removed. For more information, see Google Domains feature deprecation .
This section lists some issues that you might encounter when transferring your
domain to other registrars.
You want to transfer your domain from Cloud Domains to another registrar but can't access your transfer authorization code
Cloud Domains does not allow transfers to other registrars within
the first 60 days of registration. To request an exception, contact
Customer Care .
If your registration has crossed the 60-day limit, see Get or reset an
authorization code .
You want to transfer a .uk or a .co.uk domain from Cloud Domains to another registrar but these domains don't support authorization codes
Some domains, such as .uk or .co.uk , don't support authorization codes. For
more information, see Transfer a .uk or a .co.uk
domain .
Domain suspension issues
This section lists some issues that you might encounter if you haven't yet
verified your domain.
Your domain stopped working and has state: SUSPENDED
When your registration resource is in state: SUSPENDED , you can generally find
more information in the issues field. The most common cause of suspension is
issues: UNVERIFIED_EMAIL . For details, see the Registrant email
verification section.
There are many other possible causes of domain suspension. If you see
issues: CONTACT_SUPPORT on your registration resource, contact the
Google Cloud support team to learn more about the domain
suspension.
