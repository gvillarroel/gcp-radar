This page describes how to transfer a registered domain from
Cloud Domains to a third-party domain registrar.
By default, domains that support transfer locks are locked to prevent
unauthorized transfers. To prepare a domain for transfer, you must do the
following:
Unlock the domain to make it eligible for a transfer. Some domain registrars
don't support transfer locks due to registry restrictions. These domains
typically remain unlocked—for example, .co.nz , .de , .fr , .jp ,
.nl , and .pw .
Get an authorization code to provide to your new domain
registrar. Some domains don't support authorization codes—for example,
.uk and .co.uk .
Verify that your contact details in the WHOIS database are correct.
