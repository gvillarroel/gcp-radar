Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: On September 7, 2023 Squarespace acquired all domain registrations and related
customer accounts from Google Domains. For more information about how this change affects
Cloud Domains, see
Cloud Domains feature deprecations ,
Renew an expired domain registration , and Squarespace purchase of Google Domains FAQ .
If you have one or more domains registered with Cloud Domains, you can
view a list of your registered domains. This is helpful when you have multiple
domain registrations in a project. You can also view the following details for
each of your domain registrations:
Name
DNS provider or name servers
Renewal status
Renewal date
Privacy protection status of your domain
You can apply filters to customize the list that you want to see.
To list and view registration details for your domains, complete the
following steps.

gcloud
To list all domain registrations in a project, use the
gcloud domains registrations list command :
gcloud domains registrations list
By default, registrations are listed in a table format.
To view registration details for a specific domain, use the
gcloud domains registrations describe command :
gcloud domains registrations describe DOMAIN_NAME
Replace DOMAIN_NAME with the name of the domain that
you want to view details for—for example, example.app .
API
To list all registrations in a project, use the
registrations.list method
with an empty body:
GET https://domains.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/registrations
You can also use filters to restrict the listed registrations:
GET https://domains.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/registrations?filter= FILTER_STRING
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the name of your project
FILTER_STRING : the filter
string that you want to use
Before URL encoding, an example filter string is
domainName:"example.com" .
After URL encoding, the filter string is
domainName%3D%22example.com%22 and in context looks like the following:
GET https://domains.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/registrations?filter=domainName%3D%22example.com%22
To view registration details for a specific domain, use the
registrations.get method
with an empty body:
GET https://domains.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/registrations/ DOMAIN_NAME
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the name of your project
DOMAIN_NAME : the name of the domain that you want
to get details for
