Edit registration settings for a domain
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: On September 7, 2023 Squarespace acquired all domain registrations and related
customer accounts from Google Domains. For more information about how this change affects
Cloud Domains, see
Cloud Domains feature deprecations ,
Renew an expired domain registration , and Squarespace purchase of Google Domains FAQ .
This page describes how to edit registration settings—including contact
settings, privacy settings, and DNS settings—for an existing domain in
Cloud Domains.
Before you begin
Before you complete the tasks, review the following information on the
Cloud Domains overview and Troubleshooting pages:
Contact information
Note : Starting in August 2025: For generic TLD domains, the
ICANN Registration Data Policy
no longer requires both administrative and technical registrant
contact information. If you submit administrative and technical
contact information, it is ignored for generic TLD domains.
There are no changes for country-code TLD domains and all contact
information continues to be required.
Privacy protection
Contact details while registering or transferring a domain for a
company
Edit contact and privacy settings
When you register a domain, you must submit contact information for that domain.
To edit a registration's contact settings, such as email, phone number, and
postal address, and to choose privacy settings for the contact information,
complete the following steps.
Caution: Changes to contact information are not atomic. If you change a contact
privacy setting from REDACTED_CONTACT_DATA to PUBLIC_CONTACT_DATA while also
updating your contact information, existing registrant contact information might
become public because changes to the registrant contact information can take
longer to publish.
Permissions required for this task

or the following IAM roles.
Permissions
