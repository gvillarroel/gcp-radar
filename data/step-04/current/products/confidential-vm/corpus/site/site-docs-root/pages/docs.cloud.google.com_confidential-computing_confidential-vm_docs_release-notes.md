Feature
Live migration
is generally available (GA)
on Confidential VM instances that meet the following configuration criteria:
A C3D machine type
AMD SEV Confidential Computing technology
An operating system image that supports live migration
February 10, 2026
Security
A vulnerability affecting Intel TDX firmware was discovered and is
being addressed. For more information, see the
GCP-2026-008 security bulletin .
October 27, 2025
Breaking
Following a firmware update, Confidential VM instances with AMD SEV-SNP generate
v4 attestation reports. Attestation report parsers that are designed for v3
attestation reports might break.
Customers using go-sev-guest to
parse attestation reports can resolve attestation failures by updating to
go-sev-guest v0.14.0 or above.
If you're writing your own parser, the attestation report format is defined by
the
SEV Secure Nested Paging Firmware ABI Specification .
October 20, 2025
Security
A vulnerability affecting AMD Zen 5 processors (Turin) was discovered and is
being addressed. For more information, see the
GCP-2025-058 security bulletin .
July 31, 2025
Feature
Support for accelerator-optimized a3-highgpu-1g machine type for securely running AI and ML workloads is now generally available, with the following specifications:
4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor (Sapphire Rapids)
Intel TDX
1 NVIDIA H100 GPU
July 14, 2025
Issue
As of June 20, 2025, Confidential VM instances using AMD SEV-SNP or Intel TDX do not support remote attestation when running the following guest OS images:
SLES 15 SP7
Ubuntu 25.04
To restore remote attestation, use an earlier guest OS version such as SLES 15 SP6 or Ubuntu 24.04.
