Page Summary
outlined_flag
Google Workspace add-ons are accessed within the host application, typically through an icon in the right navigation (desktop) or bottom of the screen (mobile Gmail).
Clicking an add-on icon opens its interface, initiating a trigger to build the add-on's homepage for user interaction.
Add-ons may require authorization to access certain functionalities or data before use.
Editor add-ons often appear as menu items within the editor's "add-ons" menu, providing specific functionalities.
Gmail add-ons can extend the compose UI with additional features and options accessible within the compose window.
You can access and start installed and authorized add-ons
directly from the application the add-on extends.
Start a Google Workspace add-on
Google Workspace add-ons that you have installed automatically appear in the host
application
interface as a column of icons (under icons for Google products like
Calendar, Keep, and Tasks). The host application
represents each add-on by a small icon; this icon is
specified in the add-on's
manifest .
Clicking an add-on icon opens the
add-on interface, and clicking the icon again hides the
interface. The location of the icon depends on the client (desktop or mobile).
On desktop
An icon for each Google Workspace add-on a user has installed appears in the
right-nav of the Google Workspace
host application .
An icon is only presented if that Google Workspace add-on has been enabled for
use with that host in its
manifest .
When a user clicks a Google Workspace add-on icon, a corresponding trigger
fires to build the initial homepage for
the add-on. Once the homepage card is constructed, the
add-on returns it to the host application for display.
If the add-on doesn't define a homepage, a default card
is presented instead.
If you open an add-on that isn't fully authorized, it
prompts you to authorize it.
After you review and authorize the requested permissions, the
add-on homepage appears, and you can then begin
interacting with it.
You can close the add-on UI at any time by clicking the
add-on icon again (or clicking the icon of a different
add-on), or by clicking the
close icon in the
add-on header.
Gmail compose
Google Workspace add-ons can extend the Gmail compose
UI , which provides
add-on functionality from Gmail's
"compose message" window. For these add-ons, the
add-on icon appears in the horizontal row at the bottom
of the compose window. The add-on icons are placed to
the right of the standard icons for message formatting, attaching files, and so
forth.
Calendar conference solutions
Google Workspace add-ons can add one or more conference
solutions
to the Google Calendar event interface. These solutions don't appear as a card
interface; rather, they appear as conferencing options in Google Calendar's
built-in Edit event interface.
Calendar represents each add-on
conferencing solution by a name and a small icon, each specified by the
calendar.conferenceSolution[]
fields in the add-on's
manifest .
When you select an add-on's conference solution,
Calendar asks you to
authorize the
add-on (if you haven't already), and may ask you to
further authorize the third-party conferencing system the
add-on connects to. After authorizing, you can freely
select any of the add-on conference solutions for your
events.
On mobile (Gmail only)
On mobile, the Google Workspace add-ons that extend Gmail have icons that
appear as a horizontal row at the bottom of the open message or draft.
Clicking an icon opens that interface at the bottom of the message.
For Google Workspace add-ons that extend the Gmail with compose
actions , the
add-on icons appear in the compose view's top-right
menu.
Start an Editor add-on
Note: Editor add-ons are only available on desktop clients, and
not on mobile.
Most Editor add-ons create one or more menu items in the
add-ons menu of the editor. It's a best practice to create at
least one menu item for an Editor add-on to serve as
the initial launch point that explains the add-on's
purpose and usage. Selecting one of the add-on menu
items causes some functionality of that add-on to
start; often add-ons use menu items to open the main sidebar or
dialog that represents the primary add-on interface.
Google Forms doesn't use the same menu bar as the other editors. Instead, you
can find Forms add-on menu items by
clicking the
extension icon in the upper left of the
Forms editor interface. Forms
add-ons only extend the form editor, not the forms that are sent
out to for replies.
