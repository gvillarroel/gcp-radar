Page Summary
outlined_flag
Google Workspace add-ons can be built using alternate runtimes, requiring HTTPS endpoints and a manifest in Google Cloud.
Add-ons use JSON for UI design with cards, handling user interactions through defined JSON responses.
Add-ons can access user data like Gmail messages and user emails by using OAuth scopes and tokens.
Secure communication is ensured by validating requests using ID tokens for authentication.
Developers can leverage pre-built UI components and schema definitions to build interactive add-on interfaces.
As an alternative to Google Apps Script, you can build an
add-on in any coding language you want, as long as you
can return properly formatted JSON for the interface to render as cards.
For a comparison of Apps Script and HTTP, watch the video "Apps
Script versus HTTP endpoints: Which should you choose? 🤔".
Set up the runtime
Pick your hosting infrastructure and set up your HTTP endpoints. If you want to
build and host your add-on on Google Cloud, we
recommend that you use Cloud Run .
Create a manifest
When you build your add-on in a different language, you
must configure the add-on's manifest in
Google Cloud.
Follow these steps to configure your add-on's manifest:
If you haven't already, create a Google Cloud project for your
add-on .
In the Google Cloud console, enable the Google Workspace Marketplace SDK.
Enable the Google Workspace Marketplace SDK
In the Google Cloud console, go to
Menu menu
> APIs & Services
> Enabled APIs & services
> Google Workspace Marketplace SDK
> HTTP Deployments .
Go to HTTP Deployments
At the top, click Create new deployment .
Give your manifest a name and click Next .
Add your add-on's information in JSON format and
click Submit .
For more information, see Manifests for
Google Workspace add-ons .
Set explicit scopes in your manifest
To build your HTTP add-on, you must explicitly set the
relevant OAuth scopes in your add-on's manifest. You must add all the scopes
required by your project to the oauthScopes array field of the
projects.deployments
resource.
We recommend that you always use the least-permissive set of scopes possible. To
protect user information, add-ons should never ask for more
scope permissions than they absolutely need. For more information, see
Scopes .
Manage granular permissions
HTTP add-on that use user authentication must support
granular permissions
to allow users to grant a subset of requested scopes. This gives users more
granular control over the data that they share and provides better transparency
and security.
The granular OAuth consent screen lets users specify which individual OAuth
scopes to authorize. The consent screen includes a summary of your project, its
policies, and the requested authorization scopes from the App Configuration page
of the Google Workspace Marketplace SDK.
During add-on execution, the add-on receives a list of
user authorized scopes.
The following code sample shows a list of authorized scopes:
{
"authorizationEventObject" : {
"userOAuthToken" : " USER_OAUTH_TOKEN "
"authorizedScopes" : [
"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.execute" ,
"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.locale"
]
}
}
Developers must check the list of authorized scopes to detect if there's any
scopes missing for the current execution.
The following code sample shows how to detect missing scopes:
// A NodeJS HTTP handler that reads the latest email and creates a calendar event.
export async function createCalendarEventFromEmail ( req , res ) {
// Ensure the required scopes are authorized.
const authorizedScopes = req . body . authorizationEventObject . authorizedScopes || [];
if ( ! authorizedScopes . includes ( 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly' ) ||
! authorizedScopes . includes ( 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.owned' )) {
res . send ({
'requesting_google_scopes' : { 'scopes' : [ 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly' , 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.owned' ] }
});
return ;
}
// Use the token for API calls and return a card response.
// ...
}
If the add-on detects any missing scopes, it should
return the list of scopes as a response. The add-on
shows a granular permissions prompt to the user with the missing scopes. The
user can then choose which scopes they want to allow.
The following code sample shows how to request specific missing scopes:
{
"requesting_google_scopes" : {
"scopes" : [
"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/books" ,
"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube"
]
}
}
While developers can prompt for individual scopes, it's best practice to prompt
for all scopes required for the current add-on
execution. This way the add-on doesn't request
unnecessary scopes and the user isn't prompted too often.
The following code sample shows how to request all the scopes from the manifest:
{
"requesting_google_scopes" : {
"all_scopes" : true
}
}
The granular permissions prompt is then shown to the user with all the missing
OAuth scopes. After the user addresses the prompt, the
add-on is executed again with the granted scopes.
Following the OAuth consent flow, the add-on
automatically repeats the last action that originally prompted the request for
more permissions.
Constraints on granular permissions
The following constraints are enforced when working with the granular
permissions flow:
The OAuth scopes must be listed in the project manifest. Otherwise, when you
try to invoke a scope it generates an error.
You can't assume users granted all requested scopes for your app. If users
don't grant access to all required scopes for the current execution, you
must request permissions for the missing scopes.
If there's only one scope required, the consent screen doesn't display the
checkbox.
Build JSON card
Design your add-on interface with the card
framework . Use JSON instead of the
Google Apps Script Card Service to build cards. For detailed information about
JSON objects for cards, see the reference
documentation .
To view examples of JSON cards, see JSON card
interfaces .
Create JSON response objects
Each unique entry point listed in your add-on's
manifest needs a unique JSON response object.
The following are common Google Workspace add-on entry points with sample
JSON response schemas.
Common entry points for Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Editors, and Google Meet
Entry point Description JSON response
homepageTrigger.runFunction The user opens the add-on's homepage . renderActions
OnClick.action.function The user clicks on actions within the add-on. onClick
TextInput.autoCompleteAction.function
The user enters text and the add-on provides automatic suggestions. getAutocompletionResponse
Entry points for Gmail
Entry point Description JSON response
contextualTrigger.onTriggerFunction
The user opens an email .
renderActions
composeTrigger
The user opens the compose view.
renderActions
Entry points for Calendar
Entry point Description JSON response
eventOpenTrigger
The user opens an event . renderActions
eventUpdateTrigger
The user updates an event. calendarClientActionMarkup
eventAttachmentTrigger
The user clicks on the add-on attachment provider in the Calendar attachment drop-down menu. calendarClientActionMarkup
Entry points for Drive
Entry point Description JSON response
onItemsSelectedTrigger
The user selects a file . renderActions
Entry points for Editors
Entry point Description JSON response
createActionTriggers
The user has chosen to create a third-party resource from the @ Menu in a
Google Workspace application.
link
linkPreviewTriggers
The user has interacted with a URL that matches a pattern specified in LinkPreviewTriggers .
linkPreview
onFileScopeGrantedTrigger
The user has completed granting file access in response to a requestFileScopeForActiveDocument action. renderActions
Validate JSON requests
A request sent to your endpoint is a POST request with a JSON event object in
the request body.
Properly guard your HTTPS endpoint to ensure requests to your
add-on are only fulfilled for ones coming from Google.
This is especially important if your HTTPS endpoint returns user data from your
service.
Use authorizationEventObject ID tokens to access Google services and validate
users and service accounts.
ID tokens
Token field Type Description
authorizationEventObject.userOAuthToken
String The end user OAuth access token, authorized with the requested scopes.
See the example to get a user's Gmail data .
authorizationEventObject.userIdToken
String An end user ID token. The user's email address is encoded in the end user ID token, formatted as a JSON web token .
To receive this event object in the request, you must specify the scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email in your add-on's manifest.
See the example to get a user's email address .
authorizationEventObject.systemIdToken String An ID token for the Google Workspace add-on's service account for a specific deployment. It can be used to verify that the request comes from Google.
See the example to validate requests from Google .
Example: Get the user's Gmail data
To access users' Google data, request the relevant scope in your
add-on's manifest. Then use
authorizationEventObject.userOAuthToken to pass the API calls.
In the following example, the add-on uses a contextual
trigger to reference the email recipient while the user is reading an email. To
learn more about contextual triggers in Gmail, see Extending the
message UI .
Add triggers and scopes
First, update your manifest to include Gmail's contextual trigger
and an OAuth scope to allow access to the current message.
{
"oauthScopes" : [
"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.execute" ,
"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.metadata"
],
"addOns" : {
"common" : { ... },
"gmail" : {
"contextualTriggers" : [
{
"unconditional" : {},
"onTriggerFunction" : "https://us-central1-test-http-runtime.cloudfunctions.net/GmailExample/simpleMessageInfo"
}
],
}
}
}
Specify the HTTPS endpoint for the add-on to apply when
the user views an email message.
If you don't want to use URL paths to distinguish between different entry
points, you can use query parameters, for example,
https://us-central1-test-http-runtime.cloudfunctions.net/HttpAddOn/exampleWidgets?trigger=onEmailOpen .
When triggered, in this case by the user opening an email, the following event
object is passed to the add-on as a JSON blob in the
HTTP body.
{
"commonEventObject": {
"hostApp": "GMAIL",
"platform": "WEB"
},
"authorizationEventObject": {
"userOAuthToken": "ya29...",
"systemIdToken": "eyJhbGc...",
"userIdToken": "jaaa45...",
},
"gmail": {
"messageId": "msg-f:1234567",
"threadId": "thread-f:2345678",
"accessToken": "xedf241...",
},
}
Extract the information
The event object doesn't have the user's email address or the contents of the
email. To get this information, use the
Gmail API to get the contents of the email with
the messageId .
To authenticate with the Gmail API, send the OAuth2 token in the
Authorization header as a bearer token. Send the OAuth2 access token from
authorizationEventObject.userOauthToken .
When using one of the per-message scopes, also include the message token from
gmail.accessToken in an additional X-Goog-Gmail-Access-Token header.
The following code sample shows how to get the contents of an email using the
Gmail API:
Java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode ;
import com.google.api.client.auth.oauth2.BearerToken ;
import com.google.api.client.auth.oauth2.Credential ;
import com.google.api.client.googleapis.javanet.GoogleNetHttpTransport ;
import com.google.api.client.json.jackson2.JacksonFactory ;
import com.google.api.client.http.HttpHeaders ;
import com.google.api.services.gmail.Gmail ;
import com.google.api.services.gmail.model.Message ;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping ;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody ;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController ;
@RestController
public class GmailMessageDemoController {
@PostMapping ( "/message" )
public JsonNode onViewMessage ( @RequestBody JsonNode event )
throws Exception {
String messageId = event . at ( "/gmail/messageId" ). asText ();
String messageToken = event . at ( "//gmail/accessToken" ). asText ();
String accessToken = event . at ( "//authorizationEventObject/userOauthToken" )
. asText ();
Credential credential = new Credential ( BearerToken . authorizationHeaderAccessMethod ());
credential . setAccessToken ( accessToken );
Gmail gmailClient = new Gmail . Builder (
GoogleNetHttpTransport . newTrustedTransport (),
JacksonFactory . getDefaultInstance (),
credential )
. setApplicationName ( "GSAO Demo" )
. build ();
HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders ()
. set ( "X-Goog-Gmail-Access-Token" , messageToken );
Message message = gmailClient . users (). messages (). get ( "me" , messageId )
. setFormat ( "metadata" )
. setRequestHeaders ( headers )
. execute ();
// Build and return response...
}
}
Node.JS
import express from "express" ;
import { Request , Response } from "express" ;
import { google } from "googleapis" ;
import asyncHandler from "express-async-handler" ;
import { OAuth2Client } from "google-auth-library" ;
const gmail = google . gmail ({ version : "v1" });
const app = express ();
app . post ( "/" , asyncHandler ( async ( req , res ) => {
const currentMessageId = req . body . gmail . messageId ;
const event = req . body ;
const accessToken = event . authorizationEventObject . userOAuthToken ;
const messageToken = event . gmail . accessToken ;
const auth = new OAuth2Client ();
auth . setCredentials ({ access_token : accessToken });
const gmailResponse = await gmail . users . messages . get ({
id : currentMessageId ,
userId : "me" ,
format : "metadata" ,
auth ,
headers : { "X-Goog-Gmail-Access-Token" : messageToken }
});
const message = gmailResponse . data ;
const response = ...; // Build and return response
res . json ( response );
}));
Example: Get the user's email address
To access a user's email address:
Add the relevant scope to your add-on's deployment
resource.
Get the client ID that was created to validate the JSON web token.
Use authorizationEventObject.userIdToken to extract the user ID and email.
Add the scope
To get access to a user's email address, add the OAuth scope
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email to your
add-on's manifest:
{
"oauthScopes": [
"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
],
"addOns": {
"common": {...},
}
}
Get the client ID
To verify the user ID token and extract the user ID and email, you must use the
client ID that was created to validate the JSON web token.
To get the client ID, visit the Google Workspace Marketplace SDK in the
Google Cloud console:
Open the Google Cloud console and select your
add-on's Google Cloud project.
Go to the Google Workspace Marketplace SDK's HTTP Deployments
tab.
In the Authorization Resource section, go to the Oauth Client Id
field and copy the ID.
Alternatively, if you've installed Google Cloud CLI, get the client ID by
running the following
get-authorization
command:
gcloud workspace-add-ons get-authorization
Extract the user ID and email
The following code sample gets the user ID and email address. CLIENT_ID_FOR_ADDON
is a placeholder for the client ID:
Java
import com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.GoogleIdToken ;
import com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.GoogleIdTokenVerifier ;
import com.google.api.client.googleapis.auth.oauth2.GoogleTokenResponse ;
import com.google.api.client.http.javanet.NetHttpTransport ;
import com.google.api.client.json.jackson2.JacksonFactory ;
final static String CLIENT_ID = "CLIENT_ID_FOR_ADDON" ;
//...
GoogleIdToken . Payload decodeIdToken ( JsonNode event ) throws Exception {
String idToken = event . at ( "/authorizationEventObject/userIdToken" ). asText ();
GoogleIdTokenVerifier . Builder builder = new GoogleIdTokenVerifier . Builder (
GoogleNetHttpTransport . newTrustedTransport (),
JacksonFactory . getDefaultInstance ());
builder . setAudience ( Collections . singletonList ( CLIENT_ID );
GoogleIdTokenVerifier verifier = builder . build ();
GoogleIdToken decodedToken = verifier . verify ( idToken );
GoogleIdToken . Payload payload = decodedToken . getPayload ();
return payload ;
// E.g. payload.getEmail() for email, payload.getSubject() for user ID
}
Node.JS
const { OAuth2Client } = require ( 'google-auth-library' );
const CLIENT_ID = 'CLIENT_ID_FOR_ADDON' ;
// ...
async decodeIdToken ( event ) {
const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client ();
const decodedToken = await oAuth2Client . verifyIdToken ({
idToken : event . authorizationEventObject . userIdToken ,
audience : CLIENT_ID
});
const payload = decodedToken . getPayload ();
// E.g. payload.email for email, payload.sub for user ID
return payload ;
}
Example: Validate requests from Google
You need the service account email to verify the
authorizationEventObject.systemIdToken .
To get the service account email, visit the Google Workspace Marketplace SDK in the
Google Cloud console:
Open the Google Cloud console and select your
add-on's Google Cloud project.
Go to the Google Workspace Marketplace SDK's HTTP Deployments
tab.
In the Authorization Resource section, go to the Service Account
Email field and copy the email address.
The following code sample authenticates requests from Google with the
add-on's system service account.
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL is a placeholder for the service
account email and HTTP_ENDPOINT is a placeholder for the
service URL of the add-on.
