View logs and metrics
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Cloud VPN gateways send logging information to
Cloud Logging, and Cloud VPN tunnels send monitoring metrics to
Cloud Monitoring. This page describes logs and metrics and how to view them.
To monitor VPN tunnel utilization, you can
define alerts for VPN tunnel bandwidth . This
monitoring method is recommended for production workloads.
View logs
Cloud VPN gateways send certain logs to
Cloud Logging . Cloud VPN log
entries contain useful information for monitoring and debugging your VPN
tunnels, such as the following:
General information shown in most Google Cloud logs, such as severity,
project ID, project number, and timestamp.
Other information that varies depending on the log entry.
For a list of useful logs, see
Cloud VPN logs .
Console
To view logs for Cloud VPN, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Logs Explorer page.
Go to Logs Explorer
Cloud VPN logs are indexed by the Cloud VPN gateway that created them:
To view all Cloud VPN logs, in the All resources menu,
select Cloud Cloud VPN gateway , and then click All gateway_id .
To view logs for only one gateway, select a single gateway name from
the menu.
Log fields of type boolean typically only appear if they have a value of
true . If a boolean field has a value of false , that field is omitted
from the log.
UTF-8 encoding is
enforced for log fields. Characters that are not UTF-8 characters are
replaced with question marks.
Route logs
You can configure the routing of
logs-based metrics for
Cloud VPN resource logs.
Cloud Logging stores Cloud VPN logs for only 30 days.
If you want to keep your logs for a longer period, you must
route them . You can route Cloud VPN
logs to Pub/Sub or BigQuery for analysis.
View metrics
To view metrics and create alerts related to your VPN tunnels, use
Cloud Monitoring .
In addition to the predefined dashboards in Cloud Monitoring, you can create
custom dashboards, set up alerts, and query the metrics by using the
Monitoring API or the Google Cloud console.
View Monitoring dashboards
The following sections describe the different ways that you can view
Monitoring dashboards for Cloud VPN.
Note: To view Monitoring metrics for
HA VPN gateways,
use Metrics Explorer .
View predefined dashboards
Monitoring offers predefined dashboards for Cloud VPN.
The Observability tab includes various metrics that help you monitor
your Cloud VPN project's health and performance in a single view.
Console
Perform the following steps to access the predefined dashboards:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud VPN page.
Go to VPN
Click the Observability tab.
The dashboard displays key project-level metrics, including
packets sent, packets received, and dropped packets.
You can filter the data by region, Cloud VPN gateway, and
Cloud VPN tunnel.
Note: With the required Monitoring permissions, you can
customize dashboard charts and set alert policies—for example, for
dropped packets.
View metrics from within a Cloud VPN tunnel
You can view the performance and status of an individual Cloud VPN
tunnel from the tunnel's details page. The Monitoring tab includes various
metrics that help you quickly monitor the selected Cloud VPN tunnel.
Console
Perform the following steps to view metrics for a specific Cloud VPN tunnel:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud VPN page.
Go to VPN
Select the Cloud VPN tunnel you want to view.
Click the Monitoring tab.
The dashboard displays key metrics, such as bytes and packets for that
specific tunnel.
Note: With the required Monitoring permissions, you can
customize dashboard charts and set alert policies—for example, for
dropped packets.
View metrics in Metrics Explorer
Note: For overall project health or specific tunnel monitoring, use the
Observability dashboard or the Cloud VPN tunnel Monitoring tab.
Use Metrics Explorer for advanced or custom analysis of Cloud VPN
metrics.
Console
To view the metrics for a monitored resource by using the
Metrics Explorer, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
leaderboard Metrics explorer page:

type is valid for either Classic VPN gateways or
HA VPN gateways.
To select a metric, use the Active metric categories and Active metrics menus.
For a full list of metrics, see
Cloud VPN metrics list .
Click Apply .
To add filters, which remove time series from the query results, use the
Filter element .
To combine time series, use the menus on the
Aggregation element .
For example, to display the CPU utilization for your VMs, based on their zone, set the
first menu to Mean and the second menu to zone .
All time series are displayed when the first menu of the Aggregation element is set
to Unaggregated . The default settings for the Aggregation element
are determined by the metric type you selected.
For quota and other metrics that report one sample per day, do the following:
In the Display pane,
set the Widget type to Stacked bar chart .
Set the time period to at least one week.
Define Monitoring alerts
Console
You can create alerting policies to monitor the values of metrics and to notify you when
those metrics violate a condition.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
notifications Alerting page:
Go to Alerting
If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is
Monitoring .
If you haven't created your notification channels and if you want to be notified, then click
Edit Notification Channels and add your notification channels. Return to the
Alerting page after you add your channels.
From the Alerting page, select Create policy .
To select the metric, expand the Select a metric menu and then do the following:
To limit the menu to relevant entries, enter Cloud VPN gateway
into the filter bar. If there are no results after you filter the menu, then disable
the Show only active resources & metrics toggle.
For the Resource type , select Cloud VPN gateway .
Select a Metric category and a Metric , and then select Apply .
Click Next .
The settings in the Configure alert trigger page determine when the alert is triggered.
Select a condition type and, if necessary, specify a threshold. For more
information, see
Create metric-threshold alerting policies .
Click Next .
Optional: To add notifications to your alerting policy, click
Notification channels . In the dialog, select one or more notification
channels from the menu, and then click OK .
Optional: Update the Incident autoclose duration . This field determines when
Monitoring closes incidents in the absence of metric data.
Optional: Click Documentation , and then add any information that you
want included in a notification message.
Click Alert name and enter a name for the alerting policy.
Click Create Policy .
For more information, see Alerting overview .
Define alerts for Cloud VPN tunnel bandwidth
To create alerting policies for the bytes per second (bps) and packets per
second (pps) limits described in
Network bandwidth ,
use Prometheus Query Language (PromQL).
When entering your queries, follow the instructions in
Creating PromQL-based alerting policies (console)
and see the following examples.
For active/active tunnel configurations, which are the default,
Google recommends setting a 50% usage threshold on your VPN tunnels. Setting 50%
alerting policies on your Cloud VPN tunnel bandwidth usage helps to
ensure that you have sufficient capacity in the event of tunnel failover.
Query for bps : this example query notifies you when the sum of
sent_bytes_count and received_bytes_count exceeds 50% of the 3-Gbps
(375 MBps) limit for a given VPN tunnel. The align rate should be scaled
appropriately to capture the necessary data. It can be set to as low as one
second (1s), and scaled higher if more data sampling points over a longer
period of days are needed.
(
rate({"vpn.googleapis.com/network/sent_bytes_count", monitored_resource="vpn_gateway", tunnel_name=" TUNNEL_NAME "}[1m]) +
rate({"vpn.googleapis.com/network/received_bytes_count", monitored_resource="vpn_gateway", tunnel_name=" TUNNEL_NAME "}[1m])
) > 187500000 # 187.5 MBy/s * 1000000
Query for pps : This example query notifies you when the sum of
sent_packets_count and received_packets_count exceeds 50% of the maximum
recommended packet rate of 250,000 pps for a given VPN tunnel.
(
rate({"vpn.googleapis.com/network/sent_packets_count", monitored_resource="vpn_gateway", tunnel_name=" TUNNEL_NAME "}[1m]) +
rate({"vpn.googleapis.com/network/received_packets_count", monitored_resource="vpn_gateway", tunnel_name=" TUNNEL_NAME "}[1m])
) > 125000
For more information about PromQL,
see PromQL for Cloud Monitoring .
Define Monitoring custom dashboards
Console
To create custom Monitoring dashboards over
Cloud VPN metrics, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Monitoring page.
Go to Monitoring
In the Monitoring navigation pane, click Dashboards , and then click
Create dashboard .
Ensure that the Edit toggle is in the on position.
Click the widget in the Chart library that you want to add to the
dashboard. You can also drag the widget from the library to the graph
area.
Configure the widget by using the widget's configuration pane, which is
displayed when the dashboard is editable and the widget is selected.
In the dashboard toolbar, to activate the Chart
library , click Add chart . Repeat the previous steps for each widget
that you want to add to the dashboard.

View metrics in Network Topology
You can use Network Topology to audit your networking configuration
and troubleshoot networking issues.
Network Topology overlays throughput values on each
connection. This feature lets you quickly see the amount of traffic moving
between entities, such as the traffic traversing the VPN tunnels between
Google Cloud and the on-premises network.
For information about the supported metrics for each connection, see the
Metrics reference .
Metric values are based on the final five minutes of the selected
hour. You can also view historical metrics for six weeks by clicking any
of the edges.
For more information, see Data collection and freshness .
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Network Topology page.
Go to Network Topology
In the entities selection pane, select a metric from the Edge metric
drop-down menu.
Navigate to a specific entity hierarchy to view traffic that is related to
that entity.
For example, if you want to view traffic bandwidth traversing the VPN
tunnel between Google Cloud and the on-premises network,
expand the entities until you see that VPN tunnel connection.
Click the entity to highlight all its traffic paths.
Network Topology displays metric values for each connection
that supports the selected metric.
View reasons for drops
