Create an HA VPN gateway to a peer VPN gateway
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create a high-availability VPN gateway that connects
to a peer VPN gateway.
HA VPN gateways use the HA VPN API and
provide a 99.99% SLA. This configuration uses a tunnel pair, with one tunnel
on each HA VPN gateway interface. To receive a 99.99%
SLA, you must configure VPN tunnels on both
HA VPN gateway interfaces.
There are two gateway components to configure for HA VPN:
An HA VPN gateway in Google Cloud.
Your peer VPN gateway or gateways.
One or more physical VPN gateway
devices or software applications in the peer network to which the
HA VPN gateway connects. The peer gateway can
be either an on-premises VPN gateway or one hosted by another cloud
provider.
Create an external VPN gateway resource in Google Cloud for each peer
gateway device or service. All peer gateway scenarios are represented in
Google Cloud by a single external peer VPN resource.
Caution: When creating an HA VPN gateway for use with a
peer gateway, correctly match the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses for the peer interfaces
with the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses for the HA VPN gateway
interfaces.
For an example, see the Google Cloud CLI command output in the
Verify the configuration section of this page. If these
IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are mismatched, the tunnels aren't established. For
instructions about how to verify your tunnel configuration, see Check VPN
status .
For more information about Cloud VPN, see the following resources:
For diagrams of this topology, see
Connect Google Cloud to your peer VPN gateway .
For best practices to consider before setting up Cloud VPN, see
Best practices for Cloud VPN .
For more information about Cloud VPN, see the
Cloud VPN overview .
For definitions of terms used on this page, see
Key terms .
If you want to deploy HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect,
see the HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect overview .
Redundancy types
The HA VPN API contains an option for REDUNDANCY_TYPE ,
which represents the number of interfaces that you configure for the external
VPN gateway resource.
When you configure an external VPN gateway resource, gcloud CLI commands
automatically infer the following values of REDUNDANCY_TYPE from the number
of interfaces that you provide in the interface ID:
One external VPN interface is SINGLE_IP_INTERNALLY_REDUNDANT .
Two external VPN interfaces are TWO_IPS_REDUNDANCY .
Four external VPN interfaces are FOUR_IPS_REDUNDANCY .
When configuring external VPN gateways, use the following interface
identification numbers for the stated number of external VPN interfaces:
For one external VPN interface, use a value of 0 .
For two external VPN interfaces, use values 0 and 1 .
For four external VPN interfaces, use values 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 .
Create Cloud Routers
When configuring a new HA VPN gateway, you can create a new
Cloud Router, or you can use an existing Cloud Router with
existing Cloud VPN tunnels or VLAN attachments. However, the
Cloud Router that you use must not already manage a BGP session for
a VLAN attachment associated with a Partner Interconnect
connection because of the attachment's
specific
ASN requirements .
Before you begin
Review information about how
dynamic routing
works in Google Cloud.
Make sure that your peer VPN gateway supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
Set up the following items in Google Cloud to make it easier to configure
Cloud VPN:
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,
create an account to evaluate how our products perform in
real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project .
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.

To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command:
gcloud init
If you are using the Google Cloud CLI, set your project ID with the
following command. The gcloud instructions on this page assume
that you have set your project ID before issuing commands.
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
You can also view a project ID that has already been set by
running the following command:
gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)'
Note: Instructions in this guide are written from the point of view of your
VPC network and Cloud VPN gateway.
Create a custom VPC network and subnet
Note: The examples in this document use one VPC network with one
subnet in one Google Cloud region . However,
your requirements might be different.
Before creating an HA VPN gateway and tunnel pair, create
a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network and at least one subnet in the region where
the HA VPN gateway is located:
To create a custom mode VPC network (recommended), see
Create a custom mode VPC network with IPv4-only subnets .
To create subnets, see Work with subnets .
To enable IPv6 for HA VPN gateways, you
must enable the allocation of IPv6 internal addresses when you create
the VPC. In addition, you must configure the subnets
to use IPv6 internal addresses.
You must also configure IPv6 on the VMs in the subnet.
To create a custom mode VPC network that has at least
one dual-stack subnet or one IPv6-only subnet
with internal IPv6 addresses, see Create and manage VPC networks .
To create a dual-stack subnet with IPv6 enabled, see
Add a dual-stack subnet .
To create an IPv6-only subnet, see Add an IPv6-only subnet .
To enable IPv6 in an existing IPv4-only subnet, see Convert an IPv4 subnet to a dual-stack subnet .
To create VMs with IPv6 enabled, see
Configuring IPv6 for instances and instance templates .
The VPC subnet must be configured to use internal IPv6 addresses.
When you use the gcloud CLI, you configure the subnet with the
--ipv6-access-type=INTERNAL flag. Cloud Router does not dynamically
advertise routes for subnets that are configured to use external IPv6 addresses
( --ipv6-access-type=EXTERNAL ).
For information about using internal IPv6 address ranges in your
VPC network and subnets, see
Internal IPv6 specifications .
The examples in this document also use VPC global dynamic
routing mode , which behaves in the
following way:
All instances of Cloud Router apply the to on-premises routes
that they learn to all subnets of the VPC network.
Routes to all subnets in the VPC network are shared with
on-premises routers.
Create an HA VPN gateway and tunnel pair to a peer VPN
Follow the instructions in this section to create an HA VPN
gateway, a peer VPN gateway resource, a pair of tunnels, and BGP sessions.
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or the following IAM roles.
Permissions

Create an HA VPN gateway
Console
The VPN setup wizard includes all required configuration steps
for creating an HA VPN gateway, a peer VPN gateway
resource, tunnels, and BGP sessions.
To create an HA VPN gateway, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the VPN page.
Go to VPN
If you are creating a gateway for the first time, click
Create VPN connection .
Select the VPN setup wizard .
For VPN gateway name , enter a name for the HA VPN
gateway.
For VPC network , select an existing network or the
default network.
For Region , select a region for your HA VPN
gateway.
For VPN gateway IP version , select a HA VPN
gateway IP version.
The IP version of the HA VPN
gateway and the peer VPN gateway must be the same.
For VPN gateway IP stack type , select a stack type for the
VPN gateway.
Note:
After you create an HA VPN gateway, you cannot modify its stack type.
If you need a different stack type for an existing HA VPN gateway, you must delete and recreate the gateway.
To support IPv6 traffic, HA VPN gateways must use either the IPv4 and IPv6 (dual-stack) or IPv6 (single-stack) configuration. To temporarily disable IPv6 traffic without deleting your gateway,
disable IPv6 route exchange in the IPv4 BGP session or
disable the IPv6 session that you established for the HA VPN tunnels.
Click Create and continue .
The console page refreshes and displays your gateway information.
Two external IP addresses are automatically allocated for each of your
gateway interfaces. For future configuration steps, make
note of the details of your gateway configuration.
gcloud
To create an HA VPN gateway, run the following
commands. When the gateway is created, two external IP addresses are
automatically allocated, one for each gateway interface.
To support only IPv4 workloads, you can create an
HA VPN gateway with the IPV4_ONLY stack type.
To support both IPv4 and IPv6 workloads, you can create an
HA VPN gateway with the IPV4_IPV6 stack type.
To support only IPv6 workloads, you can create an
HA VPN gateway with the IPV6_ONLY stack type.
To create an HA VPN gateway with IPv4 interfaces,
run the following command. When the gateway is created, two external IPv4
addresses are automatically allocated, one for each gateway interface.
gcloud compute vpn-gateways create GW_NAME \
--network= NETWORK \
--region= REGION \
[--stack-type= IP_STACK ]
Replace the following:
GW_NAME : the name of the gateway
NETWORK : the name of your Google Cloud network
REGION : the Google Cloud
region where you create the
gateway and tunnel
IP_STACK : the IP stack to use. Specify
either IPV4_ONLY or IPV4_IPV6 .
If you don't specify this flag,
the stack type is IPV4_ONLY for the
HA VPN gateway. The --stack-type flag
is optional.
You can also specify --gateway-ip-version=IPV4 . However, this flag isn't
required. If you don't specify this flag, the HA VPN
gateway defaults to using external IPv4 addresses.
To create an HA VPN gateway with IPv6 interfaces, run
the following command. When the gateway is created, two external IPv6
addresses are automatically allocated, one for each gateway interface.
gcloud compute vpn-gateways create GW_NAME \
--network= NETWORK \
--region= REGION \
--gateway-ip-version=IPV6 \
--stack-type= IP_STACK
Replace the following:
GW_NAME : the name of the gateway
NETWORK : the name of your Google Cloud network
REGION : the Google Cloud
region where you create the
gateway and tunnel
IP_STACK : the IP stack to use. Specify
either IPV4_IPV6 or IPV6_ONLY .
If you don't specify this flag,
the stack type is IPV4_IPV6 for the
HA VPN gateway. The --stack-type flag
is optional.
The gateway that you create looks similar to the following example
output. If you specify --gateway-ip-version=IPV6 , IPv6 interfaces are
assigned.
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/vpnGateways/ha-vpn-gw-a].

API
To create the full configuration for an HA VPN gateway,
use the API commands in the following sections. All field values used in
these sections are example values.
To create an HA VPN gateway, make a POST request
by using the
vpnGateways.insert method :
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /vpnGateways
{
"name": "ha-vpn-gw-a",
"network": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/network-a",
"stackType": "IPV4_IPV6",
"gatewayIpVersion": "IPV4"
}
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/beta/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /vpnGateways
{
"name": "ha-vpn-gw-a",
"network": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/beta/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/network-a",
"gatewayIpVersion": "IPV6",
"stackType": "IPV6_ONLY"
}
When you create an HA VPN gateway with IPv4 interfaces,
the gatewayIpVersion and stackType fields are optional.
If you don't specify stackType , the default value is IPV4_ONLY .
If you don't specify gatewayIpVersion , the default value is IPV4 .
The only valid stackType values for a gateway with a
gatewayIpVersion of IPV4 are IPV4_IPV6 or IPV4_ONLY .
When you create an HA VPN gateway with IPv6 interfaces,
specify IPV6 as the gatewayIpVersion value. The
stackType field is optional.
If you don't specify stackType , the default value is IPV4_IPV6 .
The only valid stackType values for a gateway with a
gatewayIpVersion of IPV6 are IPV4_IPV6 or
IPV6_ONLY .
Create a peer VPN gateway resource
Console
The peer VPN gateway resource represents your non-Google Cloud gateway
in Google Cloud.
Note: If you specify a peer VPN gateway resource with one interface, the
Google Cloud console creates only one tunnel on one interface of the
HA VPN gateway. For your configuration to meet the
99.99% SLA, follow the instructions at the end of this procedure
for creating an additional tunnel.
To create a peer VPN gateway resource, follow these steps:
On the Create a VPN page, under Peer VPN gateway , select
On-prem or Non-Google Cloud .
Under Peer VPN gateway name , choose an existing peer gateway or
click Create a new peer VPN gateway .
If you choose an existing gateway, the Google Cloud console selects the
number of tunnels to configure based on the number of peer interfaces
that you configured on the existing peer gateway.
To create a new peer gateway, complete the following steps:
Specify a Name for the peer VPN gateway.
Under Peer VPN gateway interfaces , select one , two , or four
interfaces, depending on the type of interfaces your peer gateway
has. For examples of each type, see the
Topologies page .
In the field for each peer VPN interface, specify the external IP
address used for that interface. For more information, see
Configure the peer VPN gateway .
Click Create .
gcloud
Create an external VPN gateway resource that provides information to
Google Cloud about your peer VPN gateway or gateways. Depending on
the high availability recommendations for your peer VPN gateway, you can
create external VPN gateway resources for the following different types of
on-premises VPN gateways:
Two separate peer VPN gateway devices where the two devices are
redundant with each other, and each device has its own external IP address.
A single peer VPN gateway that uses two separate interfaces, each with its
own external IP address. For this kind of peer gateway, you can create a
single external VPN gateway with two interfaces.
A single peer VPN gateway with a single external IP address.
Option 1: Create an external VPN gateway resource for two separate peer
VPN gateway devices
For this type of peer gateway, each interface of the external VPN gateway
has one external IP address, and each address is from one of the peer VPN
gateway devices:
gcloud compute external-vpn-gateways create PEER_GW_NAME \
--interfaces 0= PEER_GW_IP_0 ,1= PEER_GW_IP_1
Replace the following:
PEER_GW_NAME : a name representing the peer gateway
PEER_GW_IP_0 : the external IP address for a peer gateway
PEER_GW_IP_1 : the external IP address for another peer gateway
The external VPN gateway resource that you created looks like the
following example where PEER_GW_IP_0 and
PEER_GW_IP_1 show the actual external IP addresses of
the peer gateway interfaces:
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/externalVpnGateways/peer-gw].
NAME INTERFACE0 INTERFACE1
peer-gw PEER_GW_IP_0 PEER_GW_IP_1
Option 2: Create an external VPN gateway resource for a single peer VPN
gateway with two separate interfaces
For this type of peer gateway, create a single external VPN
gateway with two interfaces:
gcloud compute external-vpn-gateways create PEER_GW_NAME \
--interfaces 0= PEER_GW_IP_0 ,1= PEER_GW_IP_1
Replace the following:
PEER_GW_NAME : a name representing the peer gateway
PEER_GW_IP_0 : the external IP address for one
interface from the peer gateway
PEER_GW_IP_1 : the external IP address for another
interface from the peer gateway
The external VPN gateway resource that you created looks like the
following example where PEER_GW_IP_0 and
PEER_GW_IP_1 show the actual external IP addresses of
the peer gateway interfaces:
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/global/externalVpnGateways/peer-gw].
NAME INTERFACE0 INTERFACE1
peer-gw PEER_GW_IP_0 PEER_GW_IP_1
Option 3: Create an external VPN gateway resource for a single peer VPN
gateway with a single external IP address
For this type of peer gateway, create an external VPN gateway with one
interface:
gcloud compute external-vpn-gateways create PEER_GW_NAME \
--interfaces 0= PEER_GW_IP_0
Replace the following:
PEER_GW_NAME : a name representing the peer gateway
PEER_GW_IP_0 : the external IP address for the interface from
the peer gateway
The external VPN gateway resource that you created looks like the
following example where PEER_GW_IP_0 shows the actual
external IP addresses of the peer gateway interface:
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/externalVpnGateways/peer-gw].
NAME INTERFACE0
peer-gw PEER_GW_IP_0
API
To create an external VPN gateway resource, make a POST request by using the
externalVpnGateways.insert
method.
For an external (peer) VPN gateway that has one interface, use the
following example, but specify only one interface ID and one ipAddress ,
with a redundancyType of SINGLE_IP_INTERNALLY_REDUNDANT .
For an external VPN gateway with two interfaces, or two external VPN
gateways with one interface each, use the TWO_IPS_REDUNDANCY example.
For one or more external VPN gateways with four external VPN interfaces,
for example, Amazon Web Services (AWS), use the following example, but
specify four instances of the interface ID and ipAddress and use a
redundancyType of FOUR_IPS_REDUNDANCY .
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/externalVpnGateways
{
"name": "my-peer-gateway",
"interfaces": [
{
"id": 0,
"ipAddress": "192.0.2.1"
},
{
"id": 1,
"ipAddress": "192.0.2.2"
}
],
"redundancyType": "TWO_IPS_REDUNDANCY"
}
Create a Cloud Router
Console
Under Cloud Router , if you haven't already, create a
Cloud Router specifying the following options.
You can use an existing Cloud Router as long as the
Cloud Router is not being used for Cloud NAT.
To create a new Cloud Router, specify the following:
A Name
An optional Description
A Google ASN for the new router
You can use any private ASN
( 64512 through 65534 , 4200000000 through 4294967294 )
that you are not using elsewhere in your network. The Google ASN is
used for all BGP sessions on the same Cloud Router, and you
cannot change the ASN later.
To create the new router, click Create .
gcloud
You can use an existing Cloud Router as long as the
Cloud Router is not being used for Cloud NAT. Otherwise,
create another Cloud Router.
To create a Cloud Router, run the following command:
gcloud compute routers create ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--network= NETWORK \
--asn= GOOGLE_ASN
Replace the following:
ROUTER_NAME : the name of the Cloud Router
in the same region as the Cloud VPN gateway
REGION : the Google Cloud
region where you create the
gateway and tunnel
NETWORK : the name of your VPC network
GOOGLE_ASN : any private ASN
( 64512 through 65534 , 4200000000 through 4294967294 )
that you are not already using in the peer network; the Google ASN is
used for all BGP sessions on the same Cloud Router, and it
cannot be changed later
The router that you create looks similar to the following example
output:
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
NAME REGION NETWORK
router-a us-central1 network-a
API
You can use an existing Cloud Router as long as the Cloud Router is not being
used for Cloud NAT. Otherwise, create another Cloud Router.
To create a Cloud Router, make a POST request by using the
routers.insert
method:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers
{
"name": "router-a",
"network": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/networks/network-a"
}
Create VPN tunnels
Console
If you configured your peer VPN gateway resource with one interface,
on the Create VPN page, configure your single tunnel in the single
VPN tunnel dialog. For a 99.99% SLA, you must create a second tunnel.
If you configured your peer VPN gateway resource with two or four
interfaces, configure the associated dialogs
that appear at the bottom of the Create VPN page.
There are two ways of creating a VPN tunnel, without cipher configuration
and with cipher configuration. If you don't want to configure ciphers, the
system uses a set of default values. Or, you can manually
configure the ciphers.
Note: You can only configure ciphers for tunnels that use IKEv2.
To create VPN tunnels, follow these steps:
If applicable, under Associated Cloud VPN gateway interface , select
the HA VPN interface and IP address combination that
you want to associate with your peer VPN gateway interface for this tunnel.
Under Associated peer VPN gateway interface , select the peer VPN
gateway interface and IP address combination that you want to associate
with this tunnel and with the HA VPN interface. This
interface must match the interface on your actual peer router.
Specify a Name for the tunnel.
Specify an optional Description .
Specify the IKE version . We recommend IKEv2, the default setting,
if your peer router supports it. To allow IPv6 traffic and to configure
ciphers, you must select IKEv2.
Specify an IKE pre-shared key by using your pre-shared key (shared
secret), which must correspond with the pre-shared key for the partner
tunnel that you create on your peer gateway. If you haven't configured
a pre-shared key on your peer VPN gateway and want to generate one,
click Generate and copy . Make sure that you record the
pre-shared key in a secure location because it cannot be retrieved
after you create your VPN tunnels.
Optional: Select cipher configuration. Select Default for automatic,
recommended security settings, or Custom to manually configure the
ciphers. For steps about how to configure ciphers, see
Configure ciphers . Skip this step if you don't want
to manually configure the ciphers.
Select routing options , route-based or policy-based.
Click Done .
On the Create VPN page, repeat the tunnel creation steps for any
remaining tunnel dialogs.
When you have configured all tunnels, click Create and continue .
Configure ciphers
You can configure ciphers when creating Cloud VPN
tunnels. If you don't configure ciphers, the system uses the default values .
To configure ciphers, do the following:
Go to the VPN cipher selection section.
Select Custom .
Configure the ciphers for IKE Phase 1 .
In the Encryption row, click edit Edit.
In the New Cipher section, select the encryption cipher.
Click Done .
To add more ciphers, click Add Cipher and select the encryption cipher,
and click Done .
Note: You can change the priority order of ciphers using the arrows.
Click Save .
Similarly, configure the following:
Integrity : in the Integrity row, click edit Edit, select ciphers, and then click Save .
PRF : in the PRF row, click edit Edit, select ciphers, and then click Save .
Diffie-Hellman (DH) : in the Diffie-Hellman (DH) row, click edit Edit, select ciphers, and then click Save .
Configure the following for IKE Phase 2 :
Encryption : in the Encryption row, click edit Edit, select ciphers, and then click Save .
Integrity : in the Integrity row, click edit Edit, select ciphers, and then click Save .
PFS : in the PFS row, click edit Edit, select ciphers, and then click Save .
Note: When selecting multiple ciphers, ensure that you order Authenticated
Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) ciphers before non-AEAD ciphers.
gcloud
Create two VPN tunnels, one for each interface on the
HA VPN gateway. When creating VPN tunnels, specify
the peer side of the VPN tunnels as the
external VPN gateway that you created earlier. Depending on the redundancy
type of the external VPN gateway, configure the tunnels by using one of the
following two options.
There are two ways of creating a VPN tunnel, without cipher configuration
and with cipher configuration. If you don't want to configure ciphers, the
system uses a set of default values. Alternatively, you can manually
configure the ciphers to create a more secure and customized tunnel. To
configure ciphers, see Configure ciphers .
Note: You can only configure ciphers for tunnels that use IKEv2.
Option 1: If the external VPN gateway is two separate peer VPN gateway
devices or a single device with two IP addresses
In this case, one VPN tunnel needs to connect to interface 0 of the
external VPN gateway, and the other VPN tunnel needs to connect to
interface 1 of the external VPN gateway.
Note: The VPN tunnels that you create aren't available until
the corresponding partner tunnels have been created on your peer VPN
gateway or gateways.

PEER_EXT_GW_IF0 and PEER_EXT_GW_IF1 :
the interface number configured earlier on the external peer gateway
IKE_VERS : 1 for IKEv1 or 2 for IKEv2; if
possible, use IKEv2 for the IKE version. If your peer gateway requires
IKEv1, replace --ike-version 2 with --ike-version 1 . To
allow IPv6 traffic, you must specify IKEv2.
SHARED_SECRET : your pre-shared key (shared secret),
which must correspond with the pre-shared key for the partner tunnel
that you create on your peer gateway; for recommendations, see
Generate a strong pre-shared key
GW_NAME : the name of the HA VPN
gateway
INT_NUM_0 : the number 0 for the first interface
on the HA VPN gateway that you created earlier
INT_NUM_1 : the number 1 for the second interface
on the HA VPN gateway that you created earlier
VPN_GATEWAY_REGION : the region of the
HA VPN gateway to operate on. Its value should
be the same as --region . If not specified, this option is
automatically set. This option overrides the default region
property value for this command invocation. The --vpn-gateway-region
flag is optional.
The output is similar to the following:

Option 2: If the external VPN gateway is a single peer VPN gateway with
a single external IP address
In this case, both VPN tunnels need to connect to interface 0 of the
external VPN gateway.
Note: The VPN tunnels that you create are not available until the

Configure ciphers
For both the previous options, you can also configure cipher algorithms
when
creating Cloud VPN tunnels. For example, to configure cipher
algorithms for the Cloud VPN tunnel that connects to interface 0 of
the external Cloud VPN gateway, run the following command:
gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create TUNNEL_NAME_IF0 \
--peer-external-gateway= PEER_GW_NAME \
--peer-external-gateway-interface= PEER_EXT_GW_IF0 \
--region= REGION \

--phase2-encryption= PH2_ENCRYPT_ALGRTHS \
--phase2-integrity= PH2_INTEGRITY_ALGRTHS \
--phase2-pfs = PH2_PFS_ALGRTHS
Replace the following:
PH1_ENCRYPT_ALGRTHS : a comma-separated list of
encryption algorithms that are supported for phase 1 IKE
security association (SA) negotiations. You can list the algorithms
in your order of preference.
PH1_INTEGRITY_ALGRTHS : a comma-separated list of
integrity algorithms that are supported for phase 1 IKE SA
negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order of preference.
PH1_PRF_ALGRTHS : a comma-separated list of
Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) algorithms that are supported for phase
1 IKE SA negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order
of preference.
PH1_DH_GROUP : a comma-separated list of
Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithms that are supported for phase 1 IKE SA
negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order of preference.
PH2_ENCRYPT_ALGRTHS : a comma-separated list of
encryption algorithms that are supported for phase 2 IKE SA
negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order of preference.
PH2_INTEGRITY_ALGRTHS : a comma-separated list of
integrity algorithms that are supported for phase 2 IKE SA

PH2_PFS_ALGRTHS : a comma-separated list of
PFS algorithms that are supported for phase 2 IKE SA
negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order of preference.
To learn more about the cipher algorithms supported by
Cloud VPN, see Supported IKE ciphers .
API
To create two VPN tunnels, one for each interface on the
HA VPN gateway, make a POST request by using the
vpnTunnels.insert
method. To get a 99.99% uptime SLA, you must create a tunnel
on each interface of your HA VPN gateway.
There are two ways of creating a VPN tunnel, without cipher configuration
and with cipher configuration. If you don't want to configure ciphers, the
system uses a set of default values. Alternatively, you can manually
configure the ciphers to create a more secure and customized tunnel.
Note: You can only configure ciphers for tunnels that use IKEv2.
Create the tunnels without configuring ciphers.
To create the first tunnel, run the following command:
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /vpnTunnels
{
"name": "ha-vpn-gw-a-tunnel-0",
"ikeVersion": 2,
"peerExternalGateway": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/externalVpnGateways/my-peer-gateway",
"peerExternalGatewayInterface": 0,
"router": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/router-a",
"sharedSecret": " SHARED_SECRET ",
"vpnGateway": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /vpnGateways/ha-vpn-gw-a",
"vpnGatewayInterface": 0
}
If you plan to enable IPv6 in the BGP session associated with this
tunnel, or configure ciphers, you must specify 2 for the
ikeVersion . IKEv2 is a prerequisite for both the features.
To create the second tunnel, repeat this command, but change the
following parameters:
name
peerExternalGatewayInterface
sharedSecret or sharedSecretHash (if needed)
vpnGatewayInterface : change to the value of the other
HA VPN gateway interface—in this example,
change this value to 1
Create the tunnels with cipher configuration.
For example, to configure ciphers for the VPN tunnel 0, run the following command:
POST https://www.googleapis.com/compute/{version}/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /vpntunnels/ha-vpn-gw-a-tunnel-0
{
"name": "ha-vpn-gw-a-tunnel-0",
"ikeVersion": 2,
"peerExternalGateway": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /global/externalVpnGateways/my-peer-gateway",
"peerExternalGatewayInterface": 0,
"router": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/router-a",
"sharedSecret": " SHARED_SECRET ",
"vpnGateway": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /vpnGateways/ha-vpn-gw-a",
"vpnGatewayInterface": 0
"ciphers": {
"phase1": {
"encryption": "3DES-CBC,AES-GCM-16-192,AES-GCM-16-256",
"integrity": "AES-XCBC-96,HMAC-SHA2-256-128",
"prf": "PRF-AES128-XCBC,PRF-AES128-CMAC,PRF-HMAC-SHA1",

"integrity": "HMAC-SHA2-256-128,HMAC-SHA2-512-256",
"pfs": "Group-14,Group-15,Group-16"
}
}
}
For phase 1, specify the following values:
encryption : a comma-separated list of encryption algorithms that are supported for phase 1 IKE security association (SA) negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order of preference.
integrity : a comma-separated list of integrity algorithms that are supported for phase 1 IKE SA negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order of preference.
prf : a comma-separated list of Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) algorithms that are supported for phase 1 IKE SA negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order of preference.
dh : a comma-separated list of Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithms that are supported for phase 1 IKE SA negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order of preference.
For phase 2, specify the following values:
encryption : a comma-separated list of encryption algorithms that are supported for phase 2 IKE SA negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order of preference.
integrity : a comma-separated list of integrity algorithms that are supported for phase 2 IKE SA negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order of preference.
pfs : a comma-separated list of PFS algorithms that are supported for phase 2 IKE SA negotiations. You can list the algorithms in your order of preference. To learn more about the cipher algorithms supported by Cloud VPN, see see Supported IKE ciphers .
Create BGP sessions
For each HA VPN tunnel, you can create an IPv4 BGP session,
an IPv6 BGP session, or both.
The following table lists the BGP session type for the
HA VPN stack and VPC network traffic.
To view specific instructions, select any BGP session type.
BGP session type
HA VPN gateway
VPC network type
Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) allowed?
IPv4 BGP sessions
IPv4 only or dual stack
IPv4 only or dual stack
yes
IPv6 BGP sessions
dual stack
dual stack
yes
Both IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions
dual stack
dual stack
no
To set up both an IPv4 and an IPv6 BGP session in the same tunnel or
to enable MP-BGP in the BGP session of an HA VPN tunnel,
use a dual-stack HA VPN gateway. However, if you set up
an IPv4 BGP session and an IPv6 BGP session in the same
HA VPN tunnel, you can't enable MP-BGP in either session.
IPv4 BGP sessions
Console
To create BGP sessions, follow these steps:
Click Configure BGP session .
On the Create BGP session page, complete the following steps:
For BGP session type , select IPv4 BGP session .
For Name , enter a name for the BGP session.
For Peer ASN , enter the peer ASN configured for the peer VPN
gateway.
Optional: For Advertised route priority (MED) , enter the priority of
routes advertised to this BGP peer.
Optional: To enable IPv6 route exchange, click the Enable IPv6
traffic toggle.
For Allocate BGP IPv4 address , select Automatically or Manually .
If you select Manually , do the following:
For Cloud Router BGP IPv4 address , enter the
Cloud Router BGP IPv4 address.
For BGP peer IPv4 address , enter the IPv4 address of the BGP
peer. The IPv4 address must meet the following requirements:
Each IPv4 address must belong to the same /30 subnet that
fits within the 169.254.0.0/16 address range.
Each IPv4 address is the first or second host of the /30
subnet. The first and the last IP addresses of the subnet
are reserved for network and broadcast addresses.
Each IPv4 address range for a BGP session must be unique
among all
Cloud Routers in all regions of a VPC network.
If you select Automatically , Google Cloud automatically selects
the IPv4 addresses for your BGP session.
Optional: If you enabled IPv6 route exchange in the previous step, for
Allocate BGP IPv6 next hop , select Automatically or
Manually . If you select Manually , do the following:
For Cloud Router BGP IPv6 next hop , enter an IPv6 address in the
2600:2d00:0:2::/63 address range. This IP address is the next hop address
for IPv6 routes that are advertised by the Cloud Router.
For Peer BGP IPv6 next hop , enter an IPv6 address in the
2600:2d00:0:2::/63 address range. This IP address is the next hop address
for IPv6 routes learned by the Cloud Router from the BGP peer.
Optional: Expand the Advanced options section.
To enable BGP peer , select Enabled . If enabled, the peer
connection is established with routing information. For more
information, see Establish BGP
sessions .
To enable MD5 authentication , select Enabled . If enabled,
MD5 authentication is used to authenticate BGP sessions For more
information, see Use MD5
authentication .
You can alternatively choose to enable MD5 authentication later.
To add outbound routes to the BGP session, for
Priority of all custom learned routes , enter a learned
route priority. For more information, see Learned
routes .
Click Save and continue .
Repeat the previous steps for the rest of the tunnels configured on the
gateway. For each tunnel, use a different Cloud Router BGP IP
address and BGP Peer IP address.
Click Save BGP configuration .
gcloud
To create BGP sessions, follow these steps:
In the commands, replace the following:
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 and
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 :
a name for the Cloud Router interface; it can be
helpful to use names related to the tunnel names configured previously
TUNNEL_NAME_0 and TUNNEL_NAME_1 :
the tunnel associated with the HA VPN gateway
interface that you configured
IP_VERSION : specify IPV4 or leave
unspecified. If unspecified, the default is IPV4 .
IP_PREFIXES and
CUSTOM_ROUTE_PRIORITY : values that let you manually
specify learned routes for a BGP session; for more information
about this feature, see
Learned routes .
AUTHENTICATION_KEY : the secret key to use
for MD5 authentication; for more information about this
optional feature, see Use MD5 authentication .
Assign IPv4 addresses for a BGP session
Choose the automatic or manual configuration method of configuring
addresses for BGP. These commands don't enable IPv6 for
BGP.
If you want to enable IPv6, run the commands listed in Assign IPv6 next-hop addresses .
Automatic
To let Google Cloud automatically choose the link-local BGP
IPv4 addresses, complete the following steps.
For the first VPN tunnel
Add an interface to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION
By default, if you don't specify an IP version,
the command assigns an IPv4 address to the interface.
The command output looks similar to the
following example:
Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
Add the BGP peer configuration to the interface for the first tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_0 with a name for the peer
VPN interface, and replace PEER_ASN with
the ASN of the BGP peer:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION
If you want to specify learned routes for the peer, add the
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges flag. You can also optionally use
the --custom-learned-route-priority flag to set a priority value of
between 0 and 65535 (inclusive) for the routes. Each BGP session
can have one priority value that applies to all the learned
routes that you configured for the session. For more information
about this feature, see
Learned routes .
For example, to add learned routes and set a priority for the
routes, run the following command:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges= IP_PREFIXES \
--custom-learned-route-priority= CUSTOM_ROUTE_PRIORITY
If you want to use MD5 authentication, add
the --md5-authentication-key flag. Use this field to
provide your secret key:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--md5-authentication-key= AUTHENTICATION_KEY
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Creating peer [bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0] in router [router-a]...done.
For the second VPN tunnel
Add an interface to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION
Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface for the second tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_1 with a name for the peer VPN
interface, and replace PEER_ASN with the ASN
configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION
If you configured learned routes on the first tunnel, you might
want to configure the same routes on the second tunnel. For example,
you can configure the second tunnel to function as a backup for the
routes; in this case, give the routes a less preferential priority (a
higher number). If you want to use both tunnels together as part of
an equal-cost multipath (ECMP) route, give the routes the same
priority that they had on the first tunnel. In either case, use
a command like the following:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges= IP_PREFIXES \
--custom-learned-route-priority= CUSTOM_ROUTE_PRIORITY
If you want to use MD5 authentication, use the --md5-authentication-key
flag to provide your secret key:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--md5-authentication-key= AUTHENTICATION_KEY
Manual
To manually allocate the IPv4 BGP addresses associated with the
Cloud Router interface and BGP peer, complete the following
steps.
For each VPN tunnel, decide on a pair of link-local IPv4 addresses
in a /30 block from the 169.254.0.0/16 address range (a total of four
/30 subnets, one per HA VPN gateway).
The IPv4 subnets that you specify must be unique
among all Cloud Routers in all regions of a
VPC network.
For each tunnel, assign one of these BGP IPv4 addresses to
the Cloud Router, and the other BGP IPv4 address to your
peer VPN gateway. Configure your peer VPN device
to use the peer BGP IPv4 address.
In the following commands, replace the following:
GOOGLE_BGP_IP_0 : the BGP IPv4 address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on
Cloud VPN gateway interface 0 ;
PEER_BGP_IP_0 represents the BGP IPv4
address of its peer
GOOGLE_BGP_IP_1 : the BGP IPv4 address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on
Cloud VPN gateway interface 1 ;
PEER_BGP_IP_1 represents the BGP IPv4
address of its peer
MASK_LENGTH : 30 ; Cloud Router
must use a unique /30 subnet from the 169.254.0.0/16 IPv4 address
range
For the first VPN tunnel
Add an interface to the Cloud Router; replace
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 with a name for the
interface:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_0 \
--ip-address= GOOGLE_BGP_IP_0 \
--mask-length 30 \
--region= REGION
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface; replace
PEER_NAME_0 with a name for the peer, and
replace PEER_ASN with the ASN configured for
the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IP_0 \
--region= REGION
If you want to specify learned routes for the peer, add the
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges flag. You can also optionally use
the --custom-learned-route-priority flag to set a priority value of
between 0 and 65535 (inclusive) for the routes. Each BGP session
can have one priority value that applies to all the learned
routes that you configured for the session. For more information
about this feature, see
Learned routes .
For example, to add learned routes and set a priority for the
routes, run the following command:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges= IP_PREFIXES \
--custom-learned-route-priority= CUSTOM_ROUTE_PRIORITY
If you want to use MD5 authentication, use the --md5-authentication-key flag to provide your secret key:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IP_0 \
--region= REGION \
--md5-authentication-key= AUTHENTICATION_KEY
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Creating peer [bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0] in router [router-a]...done.
For the second VPN tunnel
Add an interface to the Cloud Router; replace
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 with a name for the
interface:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_1 \
--ip-address= GOOGLE_BGP_IP_1 \
--mask-length 30 \
--region= REGION
Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface; replace
PEER_NAME_1 with a name for the peer, and
replace PEER_ASN with the ASN configured for
the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IP_1 \
--region= REGION
If you configured learned routes on the first tunnel, you might
want to specify the same routes on the second tunnel. For example,
you can configure the second tunnel to function as a backup for the
routes; in this case, give the routes a less preferential priority (a
higher number). If you want to use both tunnels together as part of
an equal-cost multipath (ECMP) route, give the routes the same
priority that they had on the first tunnel. In either case, use
a command like the following:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges= IP_PREFIXES \
--custom-learned-route-priority= PRIORITY
Optional: To enable MD5 authentication, use the
--md5-authentication-key flag to provide your secret key:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IP_0 \
--region= REGION \
--md5-authentication-key= AUTHENTICATION_KEY
Assign IPv6 next-hop addresses
Use the commands in this section only if you want VPN tunnels that
use MP-BGP and exchange both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
If you don't want to route IPv6 traffic over this tunnel, or if you
plan to add a single IPv6 BGP session
to this tunnel later, then you can use the commands listed in
Assign IPv4 BGP addresses .
Automatic
If you create an IPv4 BGP session that uses MP-BGP,
Google Cloud can assign IPv6 next-hop addresses
automatically for you.
Google Cloud assigns unused addresses from the
2600:2d00:0:2::/63 IPv6 address range.
This configuration has no relation to
whether you choose automatic or manual configuration for the
Cloud Router and BGP peer IPv4 addresses. The following
commands use automatic configuration. However, you can also assign
BGP IPv4 and BGP peer IPv4 addresses by using the --ip-address and
--peer-ip-address flags that are described
in Assign IPv4 BGP addresses .
For the first VPN tunnel
Add an interface to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface for the first tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_0 with a name for the peer
VPN interface, and replace PEER_ASN with
the ASN configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--enable-ipv6
By specifying the --enable-ipv6 flag, you enable IPv6 route
exchange in this IPv4 BGP session, which is required to assign IPv6
next hop addresses. You can disable IPv6 route exchange later. For
more information, see Configure multiprotocol BGP for IPv4 or IPv6
sessions .
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Creating peer [bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0] in router [router-a]...done.
For the second VPN tunnel
Add a second interface to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION
Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface for the second tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_1 with a name for the peer VPN
interface, and replace PEER_ASN with the ASN
configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--enable-ipv6
Manual
When you create an IPv4 BGP session that uses MP-BGP, you
can manually configure IPv6 next-hop addresses for both
Cloud Router and the BGP peer.
This configuration has no relation to
whether you choose automatic or manual configuration of the
Cloud Router and BGP peer IPv4 addresses.
For examples on how to configure those addresses manually,
see Assign IPv4 BGP addresses .
For each VPN tunnel, decide on a pair of IPv6 next hop addresses.
The IPv6 next hop addresses that you specify must be unique
among all Cloud Routers in all regions of a
VPC network, and selected from the internal
IPv6 address ranges that have been pre-allocated by Google:
2600:2d00:0:2::/63 .
To manually allocate the BGP IPv6 next-hop addresses, complete the
following steps.
For the first VPN tunnel
Add an interface to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface for the first tunnel .
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--enable-ipv6 \
--ipv6-nexthop-address= IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS \
--peer-ipv6-nexthop-address= PEER_IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS
In the commands, replace the following:
PEER_NAME_0 with a name for the peer
VPN interface
PEER_ASN with the ASN configured
for the peer VPN gateway
IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS : the next hop address
for IPv6 routes that are advertised by Cloud Router;
the address must be in the 2600:2d00:0:2::/63 IPv6
address range
PEER_IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS : the next hop address
for IPv6 routes that are learned by Cloud Router from the BGP peer;
the address must be in the 2600:2d00:0:2::/63 IPv6
address range
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Creating peer [bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0] in router [router-a]...done.
For the second VPN tunnel
Add a second interface to the Cloud Router.
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION
Add a BGP peer configuration to the second interface for the second tunnel .
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--enable-ipv6 \
--ipv6-nexthop-address= IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS \
--peer-ipv6-nexthop-address= PEER_IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS
In the commands, replace the following:
PEER_NAME_1 with a name for the peer
VPN interface
PEER_ASN with the ASN configured
for the peer VPN gateway
IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS : the next hop address
for IPv6 routes that are advertised by Cloud Router
PEER_IPV6_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS : the next hop address
for IPv6 routes learned by the Cloud Router from the BGP
peer
API
To create BGP sessions, follow these steps:
To create a Cloud Router interface, make one of the following requests:
PATCH : Use the routers.patch method
UPDATE : Use the routers.update method
The PATCH request updates only the parameters that you include,
whereas the UPDATE request updates all the parameters of
a Cloud Router.
Each BGP address range for each IPv4 BGP session
must be unique among all Cloud Routers in all regions of a
VPC network.
Repeat this step and command for each VPN tunnel on the second
HA VPN gateway.
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/ ROUTER_NAME
{
"interfaces": [
{
"name": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0",
"linkedVpnTunnel": "ha-vpn-gw-a-tunnel-0",
"ipRange": "169.254.0.1/30"
}
]
}
To add a BGP peer configuration to the interface, make one of the following requests:
PATCH : Use the routers.patch method
UPDATE : Use the routers.update method
Repeat this command for the other VPN tunnel, changing all options
except name and peerAsn .
For example:
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/ ROUTER_NAME
{
"bgpPeers": [
{
"interfaceName": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0",

"peerAsn": 65002,
"peerIpAddress": "169.254.0.2",
"advertiseMode": "DEFAULT"
}
]
}
The following example includes a command to add a BGP peer
with IPv6 route exchange enabled and manually configured IPv6 next-hop
addresses. If you omit ipv6NexthopAddress and peerIpv6NexthopAddress ,
then the IPv6 next-hop addresses are automatically assigned.
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/ ROUTER_NAME

"ipv6NexthopAddress: "2600:2d00:0:2::1"
"peerIpv6NexthopAddress: "2600:2d00:0:2::2"
}
]
}
If you want to specify learned routes for the peer, define
the IP prefixes for the routes. You can also optionally set a priority
value of between 0 and 65535 (inclusive) for the routes. Each BGP
session can have one priority value that applies to all the custom
learned routes that you configured for the session. For more
information about this feature, see

To create BGP sessions, follow these steps:
In the commands, replace the following:
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 and
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 :
a name for the Cloud Router interface; it can be
helpful to use names related to the tunnel names configured previously
TUNNEL_NAME_0 and TUNNEL_NAME_1 :
the tunnel associated with the HA VPN gateway
interface that you configured
IP_VERSION : IPV6 . This parameter is only required if
you want Google Cloud to assign the IPv6 address automatically
for this interface. If you are manually assigning an
IPv6 address to this interface, you can omit this flag.
IP_PREFIXES and
CUSTOM_ROUTE_PRIORITY : values that let you manually
specify learned routes for a BGP session; for more information
about this feature, see
Learned routes .
AUTHENTICATION_KEY : the secret key to use
for MD5 authentication; for more information about this
optional feature, see Use MD5 authentication .
Optional: Assign a BGP identifier range
When you add the first interface to a Cloud Router,
a BGP identifier range is automatically assigned to the
Cloud Router. If you prefer to define your own BGP identifier
range for a Cloud Router, you can create your own range.
You can also modify this range later.
For more information, see
Configure the BGP identifier range for a Cloud Router .
Assign IPv6 BGP addresses
The following procedures create IPv6 BGP sessions with automatically
or manually configured BGP IPv6 and BGP peer IPv6 addresses.
If you want to use IPv6 BGP with MP-BGP,
run the commands listed in
Assign IPv4 next-hop addresses .
Automatic
To let Google Cloud automatically choose the IPv6 addresses for the BGP session, complete the following steps.
For the first VPN tunnel
Add an interface to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--ip-version=IPV6
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface for the first tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_0 with a name for the peer
VPN interface, and replace PEER_ASN with
the ASN configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION
If you want to specify learned routes for the peer, add the
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges flag. You can also optionally use
the --custom-learned-route-priority flag to set a priority value of
between 0 and 65535 (inclusive) for the routes. Each BGP session
can have one priority value that applies to all the learned
routes that you configured for the session. For more information
about this feature, see
Learned routes .
For example, to add learned routes and set a priority for the
routes, run the following command:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges= IP_PREFIXES \
--custom-learned-route-priority= CUSTOM_ROUTE_PRIORITY
Optional: If you want to enable MD5 authentication, use the
--md5-authentication-key flag to provide your secret key:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--md5-authentication-key= AUTHENTICATION_KEY
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Creating peer [bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0] in router [router-a]...done.
For the second VPN tunnel
Add a second interface to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--ip-version=IPV6
Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface for the second tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_1 with a name for the peer VPN
interface, and replace PEER_ASN with the ASN
configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION
If you configured learned routes on the first tunnel, you might
want to configure the same routes on the second tunnel. For example,
you can configure the second tunnel to function as a backup for the
routes; in this case, give the routes a less preferential priority (a
higher number). If you want to use both tunnels together as part of
an equal-cost multipath (ECMP) route, give the routes the same
priority that they had on the first tunnel. In either case, use
a command like the following:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges= IP_PREFIXES \
--custom-learned-route-priority= CUSTOM_ROUTE_PRIORITY
Optional: If you want to enable MD5 authentication, use the
--md5-authentication-key flag to provide your secret key:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--md5-authentication-key= AUTHENTICATION_KEY
Manual
To manually allocate IPv6 addresses to the BGP session associated
with the Cloud Router interface and BGP peer, complete
the following steps.
For each VPN tunnel, decide on a pair of appropriate IPv6
addresses for the BGP session based on the type of BGP
session you are configuring.
Each IPv6 address must be unique local addresses (ULA) from the
fdff:1::/64 IPv6 address range with a mask length of /126 or lower. For example,
fdff:1::1 .
Each IPv6 address must be unique among all Cloud Routers
in all regions of a VPC network.
For each tunnel, assign one of these IPv6 addresses to
the Cloud Router, and the other IPv6 address to your
peer VPN gateway. Configure your peer VPN device
to use the peer IPv6 address of the BGP session.
In the following commands, replace the following:
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_0 : the IPv6 address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on
Cloud VPN gateway interface 0 ;
PEER_BGP_IPV6_0 represents the IPv6
address of its BGP peer and must match the IP version of
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_0
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_1 : the IPv6 address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on
Cloud VPN gateway interface 1 ;
PEER_BGP_IPV6_1 represents the IPv6
address of its BGP peer and must match the IP version of
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_1
For the first VPN tunnel
Add an interface to the Cloud Router; replace
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 with a name for the
interface:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_0 \
--ip-address= GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_0 \
--mask-length= MASK_LENGTH \
--region= REGION \
Replace MASK_LENGTH with a value of 126 or
lower.
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface; replace
PEER_NAME_0 with a name for the peer, and
replace PEER_ASN ` with the ASN configured for
the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IPV6_0 \
--region= REGION
If you want to specify learned routes for the peer, add the
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges flag. You can also
optionally use
the --custom-learned-route-priority flag to set a priority value of
between 0 and 65535 (inclusive) for the routes. Each BGP session
can have one priority value that applies to all the learned
routes that you configured for the session. For more information
about this feature, see
Learned routes .
For example, to add learned routes and set a priority for the
routes, run the following command:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges= IPV6_PREFIXES \
--custom-learned-route-priority= CUSTOM_ROUTE_PRIORITY
Optional: If you want to enable MD5 authentication, use the
--md5-authentication-key flag to provide your secret key:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IPV6_0 \
--region= REGION \
--md5-authentication-key= AUTHENTICATION_KEY
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Creating peer [bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0] in router [router-a]...done.
For the second VPN tunnel
Add a second interface to the Cloud Router; replace
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 with a name for the
interface:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_1 \
--ip-address= GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_1 \
--mask-length= MASK_LENGTH \
--region= REGION \
Replace MASK_LENGTH with a value of 64 or
lower.
Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface; replace
PEER_NAME_1 with a name for the peer, and
replace PEER_ASN with the ASN configured for
the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IPV6_1 \
--region= REGION
If you configured learned routes on the first tunnel, you might
want to specify the same routes on the second tunnel. For example,
you can configure the second tunnel to function as a backup for the
routes; in this case, give the routes a less preferential priority (a
higher number). If you want to use both tunnels together as part of
an equal-cost multipath (ECMP) route, give the routes the same
priority that they had on the first tunnel. In either case, use
a command like the following:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--set-custom-learned-route-ranges= IPV6_PREFIXES \
--custom-learned-route-priority= PRIORITY
Optional: If you want to enable MD5 authentication, use the
--md5-authentication-key flag to provide your secret key:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IPV6_1 \
--region= REGION \
--md5-authentication-key= AUTHENTICATION_KEY
Assign IPv4 next-hop addresses
Use the commands in this section only if you want VPN tunnels that use
MP-BGP. With MP-BGP, you can exchange IPv4 routes over IPv6 BGP sessions.
If you don't plan to use MP-BGP in the BGP session
for the tunnel, then use the commands listed in
Assign IPv6 BGP addresses .
You can choose to automatically or manually configure BGP peer next
hop IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
Automatic
If you create an IPv6 BGP session that uses MP-BGP,
Google Cloud can assign IPv4 next-hop addresses
automatically for you.
Google Cloud assigns unused addresses from the 169.254.0.0/16 address
range.
This configuration has no relation to
whether you choose automatic or manual configuration for the
Cloud Router and BGP peer IPv6 addresses. The following
commands use automatic configuration. However, you can also assign the
IPv6 addresses to the Cloud Router
interfaces and BGP peers by using the --ip-address and
--peer-ip-address flags that are described in
Assign IPv6 BGP IP addresses .
For the first VPN tunnel
Add an interface to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--ip-version=IPV6
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface for the first tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_0 with a name for the peer
VPN interface, and replace PEER_ASN with
the ASN configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--enable-ipv4
The command output looks similar to the
following example:
Creating peer [bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0] in router [router-a]...done.
For the second VPN tunnel
Add a second interface to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--ip-version=IPV6
Add a BGP peer configuration to the second interface for the second tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_1 with a name for the peer VPN
interface, and replace PEER_ASN with the ASN
configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION \
--enable-ipv4
Manual
When you create IPv6 BGP sessions that use MP-BGP, you
can manually configure IPv4 next-hop addresses for both
Cloud Router and the BGP peer.
This configuration has no relation to
whether you choose automatic or manual configuration of the
Cloud Router and IPv6 addresses for BGP sessions.
For examples on how to configure those addresses manually,
see Assign IPv6 BGP addresses .
For each VPN tunnel, select a pair of IPv4 next-hop addresses
from the link-local IPv4 address range 169.254.0.0/16 . These IPv4
addresses must be unique across all Cloud Routers in
your VPC network.
To manually allocate the BGP IPv4 next hop addresses, complete the
following steps.
For the first VPN tunnel
Add an interface to the Cloud Router.
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0 \

In the commands, replace the following:
PEER_NAME_0 with a name for the peer
VPN interface
PEER_ASN with the ASN configured
for the peer VPN gateway
IPV4_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS : the next hop address
for IPv4 routes that are advertised by Cloud Router;
the address must be in the 169.254.0.0/16 IPv4 address range
PEER_IPV4_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS : the next hop address
for IPv4 routes that are learned by Cloud Router from the
BGP peer; the address must be in the 169.254.0.0/16 IPv4 address
range
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Creating peer [bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0] in router [router-a]...done.
For the second VPN tunnel
Add a second interface to the Cloud Router.
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \

--ipv4-nexthop-address= IPV4_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS \
--peer-ipv4-nexthop-address= PEER_IPV4_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS
In the following commands, replace the following:
PEER_NAME_1 with a name for the peer
VPN interface
PEER_ASN with the ASN configured
for the peer VPN gateway
IPV4_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS : the next hop address
for IPv4 routes that are advertised by Cloud Router;
the address must be in the 169.254.0.0/16 IPv4 address range
PEER_IPV4_NEXTHOP_ADDRESS : the next hop address
for IPv4 routes that are learned by Cloud Router from the
BGP peer; the address must be in the 169.254.0.0/16 IPv4
address range
API
To create BGP sessions, follow these steps:
To create a Cloud Router interface and assign it an IPv6
address, make either a
PATCH or UPDATE request by using the
routers.patch method
or the routers.update method .
PATCH updates only the parameters that you include. UPDATE
updates all parameters for Cloud Router.
The following example creates an interface with a manually
configured IPv6 address.
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/ ROUTER_NAME
{
"interfaces": [
{
"name": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0",
"linkedVpnTunnel": "ha-vpn-gw-a-tunnel-0",
"ipRange": "fdff:1::/112"
}
]
}
Each BGP address range for each IPv6 BGP session
must be unique among all Cloud Routers in all regions of a
VPC network.
As another example, the following command creates an interface
with an automatically assigned IPv6 address.
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/ ROUTER_NAME
{
"interfaces": [
{
"name": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0",
"linkedVpnTunnel": "ha-vpn-gw-a-tunnel-0",
"ipVersion": "IPV6"
}
]
}
Repeat this step for each VPN tunnel on the HA VPN
gateway.
Add a BGP peer configuration to a Cloud Router for a VPN tunnel,
make either a PATCH or UPDATE request by using the
routers.patch method
or the routers.update method .
Repeat this command for the other VPN tunnel, changing all options
except name and peerAsn .
For example:
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/ ROUTER_NAME
{
"bgpPeers": [
{
"interfaceName": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0",
"ipAddress": "fdff:1::1",
"name": "bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0",
"peerAsn": 65002,
"peerIpAddress": "fdff:1::2",
"advertiseMode": "DEFAULT"
}
]
}
The following example includes a command to add a BGP peer for
the IPv6 BGP interface with IPv4 route exchange enabled and IPv4 next-hop
addresses manually configured. If you omit ipv4NexthopAddress and
peerIpv4NexthopAddress , then IPv4 next-hop addresses are automatically
assigned.
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers// ROUTER_NAME
{
"bgpPeers": [
{
"interfaceName": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0",
"ipAddress": "fdff:1::1",
"name": "bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0",
"peerAsn": 65002,
"peerIpAddress": "fdff:1::2",
"advertiseMode": "DEFAULT",
"enableIpv4": true,
"ipv4NexthopAddress: "169.254.0.1",
"peerIpv4NexthopAddress: "169.254.0.2"
}
]
}
If you want to specify learned routes for the peer, define
the IP prefixes for the routes. You can also optionally set a priority
value of between 0 and 65535 (inclusive) for the routes. Each BGP
session can have one priority value that applies to all the custom
learned routes that you configured for the session. For more
information, see
Learned routes .
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/ ROUTER_NAME
{
"bgpPeers": [
{

"peerAsn": 65002,
"peerIpAddress": "fdff:1::2",
"advertiseMode": "DEFAULT",

{
"range": "6.7.0.0/16"
},
{
"range": "2001:db8:abcd:12::/64"
}
]
}
]
}
If you want to configure the session to use MD5 authentication, your
request must include an authentication key, which means that it must
provide both the key and a name for the key. It must also reference the
key by name when creating the BGP peering session. For example:
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/ ROUTER_NAME
{
"md5AuthenticationKeys": [
{
"name": "bgppeer-1-key",
"key": "secret_key_value"
}
],
}
{
"bgpPeers": [
{
"interfaceName": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0",
"ipAddress": "fdff:1::1",
"name": "bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0",
"peerAsn": 65002,
"peerIpAddress": "fdff:1::2",
"advertiseMode": "DEFAULT",
"md5AuthenticationKeyName": "bgppeer-1-key"
}
]
}
Both IPv4 BGP and IPv6 BGP sessions
Use the following steps to create both an IPv4 BGP
session and an IPv6 BGP session that run in parallel in the same
HA VPN tunnel.
To create this configuration, add two BGP interfaces and two BGP peers to your
Cloud Router, linking them to the same VPN tunnel. You can't use MP-BGP
on either of the BGP sessions.

the same tunnel; it can be helpful to use names related to the tunnel names
configured previously
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1_ipv4 , ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1_ipv6 :
names for the second set of Cloud Router BGP interfaces
TUNNEL_NAME_0 and TUNNEL_NAME_1 :
the tunnel associated with the HA VPN gateway
interface that you configured
IP_PREFIXES and
CUSTOM_ROUTE_PRIORITY : values that let you manually
specify learned routes for a BGP session; for more information
about this feature, see
Learned routes .
AUTHENTICATION_KEY : the secret key to use
for MD5 authentication; for more information about this
optional feature, see Use MD5 authentication .
In addition, you can choose to automatically or manually
configure the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for your Cloud Router
interfaces and BGP peers.
Optional: Assign a BGP identifier range
When you add the first interface with an IPv6 address to
a Cloud Router, a BGP identifier range is automatically
assigned to the Cloud Router. If you prefer to define
your own BGP identifier range for a Cloud Router, you
can create your own range. You can also modify this range later.
For more information, see
Configure the BGP identifier range for a Cloud Router .
Automatic
To let Google Cloud automatically choose the BGP
addresses, complete the following steps.
For the first VPN tunnel
Add an interface with an IPv4 address to the Cloud Router.
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0_ipv4 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION
--ip-version=IPV4
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
Add a second interface with an IPv6 address to the same tunnel.
Run the following command:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0_ipv6 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_0 \
--region= REGION \
--ip-version=IPV6
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
Add a BGP peer configuration to the first interface with the IPv4 address for the first tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_0_ipv4 with a name for the peer
VPN interface, and replace PEER_ASN with
the ASN configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0_ipv4 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0_ipv4 \
--region= REGION
Add a BGP peer configuration to the second interface with the IPv6
address for the first tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_0_ipv6 with a name for the peer
VPN interface, and replace PEER_ASN with
the ASN configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0_ipv6 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0_ipv6 \
--region= REGION
In most cases the PEER_ASN is the same, but it can
be different depending on your on-premises network topology.
For the second VPN tunnel
Add an interface with an IPv4 address to the Cloud Router:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1_ipv4 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_1 \
--region= REGION
--ip-version=IPV4

--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1_ipv6 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1_ipv6 \
--region= REGION
In most cases the PEER_ASN is the same, but it can
be different depending on your on-premises network topology.
Manual
To manually allocate the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with the
Cloud Router interfaces and BGP peers, complete the following
steps.
For each VPN tunnel, decide on a pair of appropriate BGP addresses
based on the type of BGP session you are configuring.
You must select four IP addresses in total for each type
of session.
For your IPv4 BGP sessions, the four IPv4 addresses must
be link-local IPv4 addresses in a /30 block from the 169.254.0.0/16
range. For example, 169.254.0.1/30 .
For your IPv6 BGP sessions, the four IPv6 addresses must
be unique local addresses (ULA) from the fdff:1::/64 range with a
length of /126 or less. For example, fdff:1:1:1::/112 .
The BGP addresses that you specify must be unique
among all Cloud Routers in all regions of a
VPC network.
For each tunnel, assign the BGP IPv6 addresses to
the Cloud Router. Configure your peer VPN device
to use the BGP peer IPv6 addresses.
In the following commands, replace the following:
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV4_0 : the IPv4 address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on
Cloud VPN gateway interface 0 ;
PEER_BGP_IPV4_0 represents the IPv4
address of its BGP peer, matches with
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV4_0
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_0 : the IPv6 address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on
Cloud VPN gateway interface 0 ;
PEER_BGP_IPV6_0 represents the IPv6
address of its BGP peer, matches with
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_0
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV4_1 : the IPv4 address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on
Cloud VPN gateway interface 1 ;
PEER_BGP_IPV4_1 represents the IPv4
address of its BGP peer, matches with
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV4_1
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_1 : the IPv6 address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on
Cloud VPN gateway interface 1 ;
PEER_BGP_IPV6_1 represents the IPv6
address of its BGP peer, matches with
GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_1
For the first VPN tunnel
Add an interface with an IPv4 address to the Cloud Router; replace
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0_ipv4 with a name for the
interface:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0_ipv4 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_0 \
--ip-address= GOOGLE_BGP_IPV4_0 \
--mask-length 30 \
--region= REGION
The command output looks similar to the following example:
Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
Add an interface with an IPv6 address to the same tunnel; replace
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0_ipv6 with a name for the
interface:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0_ipv6 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_0 \
--ip-address= GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_0 \
--mask-length= MASK_LENGTH \
--region= REGION \
Replace MASK_LENGTH with a value of 64 or
lower.
Add a BGP peer configuration to the first interface for the first tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_0_ipv4 with a name for the
peer VPN interface, and replace PEER_ASN with the
ASN configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0_ipv4 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0_ipv4 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IPV4_0 \
--region= REGION
Add a BGP peer configuration to the second interface for the first tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_0_ipv6 with a name for the
peer VPN interface, and replace PEER_ASN with the
ASN configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_0_ipv6 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_0_ipv6 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IPV6_0 \
--region= REGION
In most cases the PEER_ASN is the same, but it can be
different depending on your on-premises network topology.
For the second VPN tunnel
Add an interface with an IPv4 address to the Cloud Router; replace
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1_ipv4 with a name for the
interface:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1_ipv4 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_1 \
--ip-address= GOOGLE_BGP_IPV4_1 \
--mask-length MASK_LENGTH \
--region= REGION
Add an interface with an IPv6 address to the same tunnel; replace
ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1_ipv6 with a name for the
interface:
gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER_NAME \
--interface-name= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1_ipv6 \
--vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL_NAME_1 \
--ip-address= GOOGLE_BGP_IPV6_1 \
--mask-length= MASK_LENGTH \
--region= REGION \
Replace MASK_LENGTH with a value of 64 or
lower.
Add a BGP peer configuration to the first interface for the second tunnel ; replace
PEER_NAME_1_ipv4 with a name for the peer, and
replace PEER_ASN with the ASN configured for
the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1_ipv4 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1_ipv4 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IPV4_1 \
--region= REGION
Add a BGP peer configuration to the second interface for the second tunnel ;
replace PEER_NAME_1_ipv6 with a name for the
peer VPN interface, and replace PEER_ASN with the
ASN configured for the peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER_NAME \
--peer-name= PEER_NAME_1_ipv6 \
--peer-asn= PEER_ASN \
--interface= ROUTER_INTERFACE_NAME_1_ipv6 \
--peer-ip-address= PEER_BGP_IPV6_1 \
--region= REGION
In most cases the PEER_ASN is the same, but it can be
different depending on your on-premises network topology.
API
To create BGP sessions, follow these steps:
To create two Cloud Router interfaces, make either a
PATCH or UPDATE request by using the
routers.patch method
or the routers.update method .
PATCH updates only the parameters that you include. UPDATE updates
all parameters for Cloud Router.
Create two Cloud Router interfaces for the first VPN tunnel on the
HA VPN gateway. You create interface with an
IPv4 address and an interface with an IPv6 address.
You can configure both interfaces and their BGP peers
in the same PATCH or UPDATE request.
The interfaces are associated with the same linkedVpnTunnel tunnel,
and the BGP peers are then associated with the interfaces.
The BGP address ranges for each interface
must be unique among all Cloud Routers in all regions of a
VPC network.
Repeat this step and command for each VPN tunnel on the
HA VPN gateway.
The following example adds one interface with an IPv4 address and one
interface with an IPv6 address to the same linkedVpnTunnel .
The example command manually specifies the IPv4 and IPv6 BGP addresses:
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/ ROUTER_NAME
{
"interfaces": [
{
"name": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0_ipv4",
"linkedVpnTunnel": "ha-vpn-gw-a-tunnel-0",
"ipRange": "169.254.0.1/30"
},
{
"name": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0_ipv6",
"linkedVpnTunnel": "ha-vpn-gw-a-tunnel-0",
"ipRange": "fdff:1::/126"
}
]
}
The following example adds an IPv4 BGP interface and an IPv6 BGP interface
to the same linkedVpnTunnel with automatically assigned IPv4 and IPv6
BGP addresses:
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/ ROUTER_NAME
{
"interfaces": [
{
"name": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0_ipv4",
"linkedVpnTunnel": "ha-vpn-gw-a-tunnel-0",
"ipVersion": "IPV4"
},
{
"name": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0_ipv6",
"linkedVpnTunnel": "ha-vpn-gw-a-tunnel-0",
"ipVersion": "IPV6"
}
]
}
To add the BGP peers to the Cloud Router for each VPN tunnel, make
either a PATCH or UPDATE request by using the
routers.patch method
or the routers.update method .
Repeat this command for the other VPN tunnels, changing all options
as needed.
For example:
PATCH https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers/ ROUTER_NAME
{
"bgpPeers": [
{
"interfaceName": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0_ipv4",

"name": "bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0_ipv4",
"peerAsn": 65002,
"peerIpAddress": "169.254.0.2",
"advertiseMode": "DEFAULT"
},
{
"interfaceName": "if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0_ipv6",
"ipAddress": fdff:1::1",
"name": "bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0_ipv6",
"peerAsn": 65002,
"peerIpAddress": "fdff:1::2",
"advertiseMode": "DEFAULT"
}
]
}

To verify the Cloud Router configuration, follow these steps:
List the BGP session IP addresses chosen by Cloud Router.
If you added a new interface to an existing
Cloud Router, the BGP IPv4 or IPv6 addresses for the new
interface might be listed with the highest index number. Use the
BGP IPv4 or BGP IPv6 address peerIpAddress to configure your peer VPN gateway:
gcloud compute routers get-status ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION \
--format='flattened(result.bgpPeerStatus[].name,
result.bgpPeerStatus[].ipAddress, result.bgpPeerStatus[].peerIpAddress)'
The expected output for a Cloud Router managing two
Cloud VPN tunnels (index 0 and index 1 ) looks
like the following example where the following is true:
GOOGLE_BGP_IP_0 represents the BGP IP address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on Cloud VPN
gateway interface 0 ; PEER_BGP_IP_0 represents the
BGP IP address of its peer.
GOOGLE_BGP_IP_1 represents the BGP IP address of the
Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on Cloud VPN
gateway interface 1 ; PEER_BGP_IP_1
represents the BGP IP address of its peer.
result.bgpPeerStatus[0].ipAddress: 169.254.0.1 GOOGLE_BGP_IP_0
result.bgpPeerStatus[0].name: bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0
result.bgpPeerStatus[0].peerIpAddress: 169.254.0.2 PEER_BGP_IP_0
result.bgpPeerStatus[1].ipAddress: 169.254.1.1 GOOGLE_BGP_IP_1
result.bgpPeerStatus[1].name: bgp-peer-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-1
result.bgpPeerStatus[1].peerIpAddress: 169.254.1.2 PEER_BGP_IP_1
You can also use the following command to get a full listing of the
Cloud Router configuration:
gcloud compute routers describe ROUTER_NAME \
--region= REGION
The full listing looks like the following example:
bgp:

bgpPeers:
- interfaceName: if-tunnel-a-to-on-prem-if-0
ipAddress: 169.254.0.1

API
To verify the Cloud Router configuration, make a GET request by
using the
routers.getRouterStatus method
, and use an empty request body:
GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /regions/ REGION /routers
Create an additional tunnel on a single-tunnel gateway
Console
To receive a 99.99% uptime SLA, configure a tunnel on each
HA VPN interface of an
HA VPN gateway.
Configure a second tunnel in the following circumstances:
If you configured an HA VPN gateway to a peer
VPN gateway that has a single peer VPN interface.
If you previously set up a single tunnel on an HA VPN
gateway to a peer VPN gateway that contains any number of interfaces,
but now want a 99.99% uptime SLA for your HA VPN
gateway.
To configure a second tunnel, follow the steps at
Add a tunnel from an HA VPN gateway to a peer VPN gateway .
Set the base advertised route priority (optional)
The BGP sessions that you create let each Cloud Router advertise
routes to peer networks. The advertisements use unmodified base priorities .
Use the configuration documented in
Creating an HA VPN gateway and tunnel pair to a peer VPN
for active-active routing configurations where the advertised route priorities
of the two VPN tunnels from the Google Cloud side and the peer side match.
To configure the same advertised route priorities from Google Cloud to
both BGP peers, omit the advertised route priority on the Google Cloud
side.
To create an active-passive configuration , configure unequal advertised route
priorities for the two HA VPN tunnels. One advertised
route priority must be higher than the other. For example:
BGP session1/tunnel1, route priority = 10
BGP session2/tunnel2, route priority = 20
For more information about the base advertised route priority, see
Advertised prefixes and priorities .
You can also specify which routes are advertised by using
custom advertisements :
Add the --advertisement-mode=CUSTOM flag ( gcloud ) or the
advertiseMode: custom flag (API).
Specify IP address ranges with the --set-advertisement-ranges flag
( gcloud ) or the advertisedIpRanges flag (API).
Complete the configuration
Before you can use a new Cloud VPN gateway and its associated VPN
tunnels, complete the following steps:
Set up the peer VPN gateway and configure the corresponding tunnel or tunnels
there. For instructions, see the following:
For specific configuration guidance for certain peer VPN devices, see
Use third-party VPNs .
For supported peer topologies, see
Cloud VPN topologies .
For general configuration parameters, see Configure the
peer VPN gateway .
Configure firewall rules
in Google Cloud and your peer network as required.
Check the status of your VPN tunnels .
This step includes checking the high-availability configuration of
your HA VPN gateway.
What's next
To control which IP addresses are allowed for peer VPN gateways, see
Restrict IP addresses for peer VPN gateways .
To use high-availability and high-throughput scenarios or multiple
subnet scenarios, see
Advanced configurations .
