Page Summary
outlined_flag
The Status type is a structured approach to define errors in APIs, containing an error code, message, and details for analysis.
The error model utilizes a JSON representation with fields for code, message, and an array for detailed error information.
Developers can integrate this model into REST APIs and RPC APIs, referencing the google.rpc.Code enum for standardized error codes.
Error messages are intended for developers and should be in English, while user-facing messages should be handled separately via localization.
The details field provides flexibility by allowing arbitrary objects to convey specific error information using a URI for type identification.
JSON representation
The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC . Each Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the API Design Guide .
JSON representation
{
"code" : integer ,
"message" : string ,
"details" : [
{
"@type" : string ,
field1 : ... ,
...
}
]
}
Fields
code
integer
The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code .
message
string
A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
details[]
object
A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" } .
