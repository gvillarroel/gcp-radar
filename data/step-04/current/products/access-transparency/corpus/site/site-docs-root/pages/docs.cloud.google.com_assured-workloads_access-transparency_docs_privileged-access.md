Privileged access at Google Cloud
Google Cloud systems are built with a focus on protecting your content
using controls and monitoring. Your content stored on Google Cloud
completely belongs to you. Occasionally, Google personnel might need to access
your content but these accesses are never without a valid business
justification.
Why Google personnel request access to Customer Data
The most common reason why Google personnel request access to
Customer Data is to resolve a
customer support ticket. If you create a customer support request,
then a Google personnel might be required to request access to your
data. Access Transparency exists to provide customers visibility into these accesses.
Google provides various controls to
support the privacy of your data, regardless of whether Access Transparency is enabled
on an organization. For more information about these controls, see
Google infrastructure security design overview .
What is privileged access
Google personnel's access to your data to fulfill an obligation of
providing a contracted service is called privileged access . Access to your
data in Google Cloud is usually because of the following reasons:
You are accessing your own data.
A service you are using is accessing data on your behalf.
When requested to provide a contracted service, Google personnel
acting as a privileged administrator can access your data.
Foundational principles of privileged access management
Google Cloud's privileged access management strategy strictly limits what a
single Google staff member can view and do with your data.
Google Cloud's privileged access philosophy is based on the following principles:
Least privilege : Access to Customer Data is denied by default for all
Google personnel. When access is granted, it is temporary and no greater than
what is absolutely necessary to provide the contracted service.
Limit singular access to data : Singularly accessing Customer Data without
another individual involved is extremely difficult for any and every
Google personnel.
All access must be justified : By default, Google personnel don't
have access to Customer Data. Google personnel can access your data
only with an active , valid business justification. Google
personnel can't access Customer Data for justifications that are closed or
where the Google person is not a directly linked collaborator.
For the list of valid business justifications,
see Justification reason codes .
Monitor and alerting : Monitoring and response processes exist to identify,
triage, and remediate violations of these principles.
For more information about Google Cloud's privileged access philosophy, see
Privileged access in
Google Cloud .
Google Cloud products regularly undergo independent, third-party audits and
certifications to verify that their data protection practices match their
controls and commitments. For more information about how Google Cloud products
provide customers with transparency and control over their content, see the
whitepaper on Trusting your data with Google Cloud .
