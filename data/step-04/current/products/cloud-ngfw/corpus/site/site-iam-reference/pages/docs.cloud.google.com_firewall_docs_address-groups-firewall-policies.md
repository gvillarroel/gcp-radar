Address groups for firewall policies
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
An address group contains multiple IP addresses, IP address ranges in CIDR
format, or both. Each address group can be used by multiple resources, such as
rules in Cloud NGFW firewall policies or rules in
Cloud Armor security policies.
Updates to an address group are automatically propagated to the resources that
reference the address group. For example, you can create an address group
containing a set of trusted IP addresses. To change the set of trusted IP
addresses, you update the address group. Your updates to the address group are
reflected in each associated resource automatically.
Specifications
Address group resources have the following characteristics:
Each address group is uniquely identified by a URL with
the following elements:
Container type: Determines the address group type— organization or project .
Container ID: ID of the organization or the project.
Location: Specifies if the address group is a global or regional resource (such as europe-west ).
Name: The address group name with the following format:
A string 1-63 characters long
Includes only alphanumeric characters
Must not start with a number
You can construct a unique URL identifier for an address group in the
following format:
<containerType>/<containerId>/locations/<location>/addressGroups/<address-group-name>
For example, a global address group example-address-group in project
myproject has the following unique 4-tuple identifier:
projects/myproject/locations/global/addressGroups/example-address-group
Each address group has an associated type that can be either IPv4 or IPv6,
but not both. The address group type cannot be changed later.
Each IP address or IP range in an address group is referred to as an item .
The number of items that you can add to an address group depends on the
address group's capacity. You can define the item capacity during address
group creation. This capacity cannot be changed later. The maximum capacity
that you can configure for an address group varies depending on the product
with which you use the address group.
You must specify the capacity and type when you create an address group. In
addition, when you use Cloud Armor, you must set the purpose
field to CLOUD_ARMOR .
When you create an address group with a purpose that is not
CLOUD_ARMOR , the address group has a maximum capacity of 1,000 IP
addresses.
Types of address groups
Address groups are classified based on their scope. The scope identifies the level
at which the address group is applicable in the
resource hierarchy .
Address groups are categorized into the following types:
Project-scoped address groups
Organization-scoped address groups
An address group can be either project-scoped or organization-scoped, but not
both.
Project-scoped address groups
Use project-scoped address groups when you want to define your own list of IP
addresses to be used within a project or a network to block or allow a list of
changing IP addresses. For example, if you want to define your own threat
intelligence list and add it to a rule, create an address group with the
required IP addresses.
The container type for project-scoped address groups is
always set to project . For more information about how to create and modify
project-scoped address groups, see Use project-scoped address groups .
Organization-scoped address groups
Use organization-scoped address groups when you want to define a central list of
IP addresses that can be used in high-level rules to provide
consistent control for the entire organization and reduce the overhead for
individual network and project owners to maintain common lists, such as trusted
services and internal IP addresses.
The container type for organization-scoped address groups is always set to
organization . For more information about how to create and modify
organization-scoped address groups, see
Use organization-scoped address groups .
IAM roles
To create and manage an address group, you need the
Compute Network Admin role ( roles/compute.networkAdmin ). You can also define
a custom role with an equivalent set of permissions.
The following table provides a list of Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions
required to perform a set of tasks on address groups.
Task
IAM role name
IAM permissions
Create and manage address groups
Compute Network Admin ( roles/compute.networkAdmin )
networksecurity.addressGroups.*
Discover and view address groups
Compute Network User ( roles/compute.networkUser )
networksecurity.addressGroups.list
networksecurity.addressGroups.get
networksecurity.addressGroups.use
For more information about which roles include specific IAM
permissions, see the
IAM roles and permissions index .
How address groups work with firewall policies
Address groups simplify the configuration and maintenance of firewall policies.
You can share the IP addresses across firewall policies and define more
complex, consistent, and robust firewall policies for your network with reduced
maintenance overhead. Consider the following additional specifications when you
use address groups with firewall policies:
The capacity of an address group gets added to the total attribute
count of the firewall policy where the address group is used. Make sure that
you set the capacity to an appropriate value based on your use case.
If an address group added to the firewall policy rule does not exist, the
address group filter is removed from the rule. For information about how
source address groups work with other source filters in the ingress rules,
see Sources for ingress rules in hierarchical firewall policies
and Sources for ingress rules in network firewall policies .
For information about how destination address groups work with other destination
filters in the egress rules, see
Destinations for egress rules .
Organization-scoped address groups can be used in
hierarchical firewall policies ,
global network firewall policies ,
and regional network firewall policies .
Project-scoped address groups can only be used in
global network firewall policies
and regional network firewall policies .
For both project-scoped and organization-scoped address groups, the location
of the address group must match with the location of the firewall policy.
