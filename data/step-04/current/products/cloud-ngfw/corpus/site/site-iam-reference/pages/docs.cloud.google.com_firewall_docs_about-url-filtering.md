URL filtering service overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The URL filtering service for Cloud Next Generation Firewall lets you control access to websites
and webpages by blocking or allowing their URLs. It lets you filter your
workload traffic by using domain and Server Name Indication (SNI) information
that is available in the egress HTTP(S) messages.
Because the URL filtering service inspects HTTP message headers, you can use the service to
block access to specific domains even when the destination server hosts trusted
sites that you don't want to block or when DNS-based access restrictions are
ineffective. You can use the URL filtering service along with the intrusion detection and prevention service to deny
traffic to malicious URLs, prevent access to malicious command-and-control (C2)
servers, and detect malware in executable files.
Cloud NGFW URL filtering service works by creating Google-managed zonal
firewall endpoints that use Google Cloud's packet intercept technology to
redirect and inspect traffic for a match against a list of configured
domain names and SNIs.
Packet intercept is a Google Cloud capability that transparently inserts
network appliances in the path of selected network traffic without
modifying their existing routing policies.
Benefits of using the URL filtering service
The URL filtering service helps you reduce required maintenance that is caused by
frequently changing IP addresses, by DNS changes, and by other
time-consuming IP address-based firewall changes. The service lets you
gain precise control over which remote URLs you can access. It lets you
gain finer control than what is possible with IP addresses, which can
host multiple services and domains.
TLS inspection
The URL filtering service can process both encrypted and unencrypted traffic. For
encrypted traffic, you can configure TLS inspection to let the URL filtering service
decrypt message headers and inspect the domain name in the message's host
header.
The URL filtering service can then use the domain details along with the plaintext SNI
sent during TLS negotiation to find a match against the configured URLs defined
by the associated security profile.
Without TLS inspection, the URL filtering service can still process the encrypted HTTP(S)
traffic, but the URL filtering service relies only on the SNI from clientHello during
TLS negotiation for URL matching. For unencrypted HTTP traffic, the
URL filtering service uses the HTTP host header for URL filtering regardless of whether
you have enabled TLS inspection.
Cloud NGFW only supports TLS interception and decryption to access
the domain information in the host header of the selected encrypted traffic.
The URL filtering service inspects both inbound and outbound connections, including
traffic to and from the internet and traffic within Google Cloud.

URL filtering service deployment model
The following diagram shows an example of the URL filtering service deployment with a
firewall endpoint, configured for a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network in a
single zone of a region.
Sample deployment model of the URL filtering service (click to enlarge).
Components of URL filtering service
The URL filtering service requires three main entities that you must configure. The URL
filtering security profile and its associated security profile group, a
firewall endpoint to receive traffic, and the firewall policies attached to the
endpoint.
Security profiles and security profile groups
Cloud NGFW uses security profiles and security profile groups to
implement the URL filtering service.
URL filtering security profiles are generic policy structures of type
url-filtering that include URL filters with matcher strings . The URL filtering service
uses these strings to match against the domain name and SNI of the HTTP(S) message. Each URL
filter contains a list of matcher strings, a unique priority, and an action.
To learn more about URL filtering security profiles, see
URL filtering security profile .
Security profile groups act as containers for security profiles. Each
group contains one or more security profiles of different types. For example,
a security profile group can contain security profiles belonging to url-filtering and
threat-prevention types. A firewall policy rule references a
security profile group to enable either the URL filtering service or the intrusion detection and prevention service,
or both, for the network traffic.
To learn more about security profile groups,
see Security profile group overview .
Firewall endpoint
A firewall endpoint is an organizational resource, created at the zonal level
that can inspect Layer 7 traffic in the same zone in which it is deployed. The
endpoints are associated with one or more VPCs in the same zone. To filter
traffic for a target virtual machine (VM) instance, create the firewall endpoint in the same zone as the
VPC where the target VM is located.
For the URL filtering service, the firewall endpoint matches the domain from the message's
host header, or the SNI obtained during TLS negotiation for encrypted traffic
without TLS inspection, against the URL filters in the URL filtering security
profile. If the endpoint detects a match, it performs the
action associated with the URL filter on the connection. This action can be the
default action or a configured action in the URL filtering security profile.
To learn more about firewall endpoints and how to configure them, see
Firewall endpoint overview .
Firewall policies
Firewall policies apply directly
to all ingress and egress traffic of a VM. You can use
hierarchical firewall policies and
global network firewall policies
to configure firewall policy rules with Layer 7 inspection.
Note: Cloud NGFW Enterprise capabilities are only available through
firewall policies. In this document, the term firewall rules refers to the
firewall policy rules, not the VPC firewall rules.
Firewall policy rules
Firewall policy rules let you control the type of traffic that is intercepted
and inspected. To configure the URL filtering service, create a firewall policy rule
that does the following:
Identifies the type of traffic to be inspected by using multiple Layer 3
and Layer 4 firewall policy rule components .
Specifies the security profile group name for the
apply_security_profile_group action on the matched traffic.
For the complete URL filtering service workflow, see
Configure the URL filtering service .
You can also use secure tags in
firewall rules to configure the URL filtering service. You can build on any segmentation
that you have set up by using tags in your network, and enhance the traffic
inspection logic to include the URL filtering service.
To configure a firewall policy rule that uses a security profile group for
wildcard domain filtering (such as *.example.com ), set the destination IP
range to 0.0.0.0/0 . This is required because wildcard matching is performed at
Layer 7 by the security profile. To restrict the firewall rule to match
internet-bound traffic, use network contexts set to INTERNET .
Note: If you configure a firewall rule to apply a security profile group and set
the destination to 0.0.0.0/0 , traffic originating from VMs in zones without an
attached firewall endpoint doesn't undergo Layer 7 inspection. The firewall rule
allows all traffic matching the other rule parameters (such as source, port, and
protocol). To ensure consistent policy enforcement, deploy firewall endpoints in
all zones within the VPC network where you have workloads that
require Layer 7 inspection.
How the URL filtering service works
The URL filtering service processes the HTTP(S) traffic in the following
sequence:
The URL filtering service applies firewall policy rules to the traffic to and from
the VM instances or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters in the network.
The URL filtering service intercepts and sends matched traffic to the firewall
endpoint for Layer 7 inspection.
For encrypted traffic where TLS inspection is enabled, the URL filtering service
decrypts the message headers and uses the domain specified in the host
header along with the SNI sent during TLS negotiation to check for a match
against the configured URLs.
If the traffic is encrypted but TLS Inspection isn't enabled, the message
header remains encrypted. Instead, the URL filtering service uses the domain
specified in the SNI during TLS negotiation.
For unencrypted traffic, the URL filtering service always uses the domain specified
in the host header to check for a match.
If the URL information matches, the URL filtering service performs the action
configured in the security profile on that connection.
If the URL filtering service allows the egress traffic, the
intrusion detection and prevention service
(if enabled) can further scan the traffic for threats.
Limitations
URL filtering only supports http/1. x and http/2 . It
doesn't support QUIC, encrypted SNI (ESNI), or Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)
with TLS inspection enabled.
If you enable TLS inspection, Cloud NGFW doesn't pass QUIC,
ESNI, or ECH traffic. However, if you disable TLS inspection,
Cloud NGFW passes such traffic without access to the domain and
SNI information. In this scenario, Cloud NGFW allows QUIC, ESNI,
and ECH traffic only when an explicit allow URL filter is available. In the
absence of an explicit allow filter, the default implicit deny URL filter
blocks the QUIC, ESNI, and ECH traffic. For more information about
explicit allow and implicit deny URL filters, see
Implicit deny URL filter .
Firewall endpoints can support IP packets of a limited size only. For more
information, see Supported packet size .
