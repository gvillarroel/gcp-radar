Reseller account with multiple Google Workspace billing account Account Starter Guide
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page is a starter guide focused on helping API partners understand how a
reseller account with multiple Google Workspace billing accounts works.
About Google Workspace billing accounts
A Google Workspace billing account is used to pay for an entitlement. A
Google Workspace billing account has a currency, region and legal entity;
these attributes are immutable and cannot be changed.
A reseller account with a single vs multiple Google Workspace billing accounts
A reseller account with a single Google Workspace billing account is defined
as an account
that only has a single Google Workspace billing account option for each
Google Workspace SKU type. There are three Google Workspace SKU types:
Google Workspace, Google Workspace Voice and Google Workspace Drive. This
means that when you select a specific SKU type, there is only a single
Google Workspace billing account that can be used and you do not need to
specify the Google Workspace billing account when you are transacting on the
Google Workspace subscription.
A reseller account with multiple Google Workspace billing accounts is when
there are two or more Google Workspace billing account options for any of the
Google Workspace SKU types. Given that there are two or more
Google Workspace billing account options when purchasing a particular SKU, you
need to specify the Google Workspace billing account. This means that you need
to add a "Select Google Workspace billing account" step to your transaction
flow. Note that the two or more Google Workspace billing account option could
have the same or different currency; either way you will need to select the
desired Google Workspace billing account when purchasing a Google Workspace
subscription.
Caution: When working with a reseller account with multiple Google Workspace
billing accounts, since there are two or more Google Workspace billing account
choices when purchasing a Google Workspace subscription, API users must add a
step in their transaction flow to select the desired Google Workspace billing
account, otherwise the transaction will fail.
Google Workspace billing account and Currency constraints
There are some Google Workspace billing account and currency constraints.
All Google Workspace subscriptions for a customer must be paid by
Google Workspace billing accounts in the same currency.
For certain SKUs, the corresponding Subscriptions need to be paid for by the
same Google Workspace billing account. For example,
Google Workspace Business Subscriptions and Google Workspace
Chrome Subscriptions must use the same Google Workspace billing account but
Google Workspace Voice Subscriptions require a different
Google Workspace billing account. The Google Workspace and Voice
Google Workspace billing account must still have the same currency to
satisfy condition 1.
Transition from a reseller account with a single Google Workspace billing account to a reseller account with multiple Google Workspace billing account
For partners that already have a reseller account with a single
Google Workspace billing account, you might notice that there is no
Google Workspace billing account selection step in your transaction flows. The
reason behind this is because for a given Google Workspace SKU type, there is
only one eligible Google Workspace billing account so our system automatically
selects that Google Workspace billing account for you. As mentioned above,
in a multiple Google Workspace billing account setup, there will be cases
where there are two or more Google Workspace billing account choices; this
means partners will need to explicitly choose the desired Google Workspace
billing account for a given transaction.
Step-by-step instruction to convert your reseller account from a single Google Workspace billing account to a multiple Google Workspace billing account.
Introduce a "Select Google Workspace billing account" step into your
transaction process. At this point, you still have a reseller account with a
single Google Workspace billing account. This means that there's only
going to be one Google Workspace billing account choice during the "Select
Google Workspace billing account" step. The benefit of doing this first is
that it enables you add the "Select Google Workspace billing account" step
into your transaction flow without any interruptions to day-to-day transact
operations.
Convert your reseller account from a single Google Workspace billing
account to a reseller account with multiple Google Workspace billing
accounts by adding a new Google Workspace billing account to your reseller
console.
That's it! Once the new Google Workspace billing account is added to your
account, the account conversion has been completed. You will see more
Google Workspace billing account options in the "Select Google Workspace
billing account" step, just select the Google Workspace billing account you
want to use and continue the
process. Detail step-by-step API integration guide
Default Google Workspace billing account logic under a reseller account with multiple Google Workspace billing account
Ideally, you have added the "Select Google Workspace billing account" step in
your transaction workflow where you always select a Google Workspace billing
account. This means that you won't need to rely on any default
Google Workspace billing account selection logic.
Caution: In the rare but unfortunate case where a partner added a second
Google Workspace billing account without introducing a "Select
Google Workspace billing account" step in their transaction flow, you will run
into transaction problem because our system won't know which Google Workspace
billing account to choose when there are two or more Google Workspace billing
account options.
To help mitigate these transactional issues, we introduced default
Google Workspace billing account selection logic to make the API as backward
compatible as possible.
Caution: The default Google Workspace billing account selection logic does not
work for all scenarios, see below.
Here is the default logic for each SKU type
Google Workspace SKU type - We will default to the first
Google Workspace billing account. For example, when you were in the
single Google Workspace billing account state, you had one
Google Workspace billing account, this will be the default
Google Workspace billing account.
Google Workspace Voice SKU type - If there is only one
Google Workspace Voice billing account, we default to this. Otherwise,
you must choose a specific Google Workspace Voice billing account, otherwise
we will throw an exception.
Google Workspace Drive SKU type - If there is only one
Google Workspace Drive billing account, we default to this. Otherwise,
you must specific a Google Workspace Drive billing account or else we
will throw an exception.
