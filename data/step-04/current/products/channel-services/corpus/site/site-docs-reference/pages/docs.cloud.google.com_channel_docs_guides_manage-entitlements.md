Manage Google Workspace and Google Chrome entitlements
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to manage customer entitlements for Google Workspace
and Google Chrome products.
Pre-requisite
Before you continue, determine whether your reseller account has a single
Google Workspace billing account or multiple Google Workspace billing
accounts. To learn more about this topic,
read Multiple Google Workspace Billing Account Starter Guide
.
Create entitlement
Before you begin
You need
a Customer
setup before you can proceed.
To create entitlement, follow these steps:
With the Customer name,
call listPurchasableSkus
to retrieve a list
of PurchasableSkus
ListPurchasableSkusRequest
{
"customer": "accounts/123/customers/abc",
"createEntitlementPurchase": {
"product": "products/-"
}
}
ListPurchasableSkusResponse
{
"purchasableSkus": [
{
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/sku_id1",
"product": {
"name": "products/product_id",
}
}
},
{
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/sku_id2",
"product": {
"name": "products/product_id",
},
}
}
]
}
With the selected PurchasableSku, use
the queryEligibleBillingAccounts
method to find a set of
Google Workspace BillingAccount
that can be used to pay for the entitlement.
If you want to pay in a specific currency, select a BillingAccount with
that currency.
QueryEligibleBillingAccountsRequest
{
"customer" : "accounts/123/customers/abc" ,
"skus" : [ "products/product_id/skus/sku_id1" ]
}
QueryEligibleBillingAccountsResponse
{
"skuPurchaseGroups" : [
{
"skus" : [
"products/product_id/skus/sku_id1"
],
"billingAccountPurchaseInfos" : [
{
"billingAccount" : {
"name" : "accounts/123/billingAccounts/billing_account_id1" ,
"displayName" : "Google_Workspace_USD_US_1" ,
"currencyCode" : "USD" ,
"regionCode" : "US"
}
},
{
"billingAccount" : {
"name" : "accounts/123/billingAccounts/billing_account_id2" ,
"displayName" : "Google_Workspace_CAD_CA_1" ,
"currencyCode" : "CAD" ,
"regionCode" : "CA"
}
}
]
}
]
}
With the selected PurchasableSku and BillingAccount, use the
listPurchasableOffers
method to find the
available PurchasableOffer
ListPurchasableOffersRequest
{
"customer": "accounts/123/customers/abc",
"createEntitlementPurchase": {
"sku": "products/product_id/skus/sku_id1",
"billingAccount": "accounts/123/billingAccounts/billing_account_id2"
}
}
ListPurchasableOffersResponse
{
"purchasableOffers": [
{
"offer": {
"name": "accounts/123/offers/offer_id1",
},
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/sku_id1",
},
"plan": {
"paymentPlan": "FLEXIBLE",
"paymentCycle": {
"duration": 1,
"periodType": "MONTH"
}
},
"priceReferenceId": "price_reference_id_123"
}
],
}
At this point you should have the BillingAccount that will pay for
the Entitlement
and the PurchasableOffer. Begin to create the entitlement by using
the create
method.
Create an Entitlement and populate the offer, billingAccount and any
other required parameters. Populate the price reference ID in the
entitlement when it's present in the PurchasableOffer to ensure that the
new entitlement has the above-quoted price. Without this price reference
ID, there is no guarantee that the discount and effective price returned
from the ListPurchasableOffersResponse will be the same in this
CreateEntitlement call. Populating this price reference ID ensures a
pricing match in this new entitlement.
CreateEntitlementRequest
{
"parent": "accounts/123/customers/abc",
"entitlement": {
"offer": "accounts/123/offers/offer_id1",
"maxUnits": 100,
"billingAccount": "accounts/123/billingAccounts/billing_account_id2",
"priceReferenceId": "price_reference_id_123"
}
}
CreateEntitlementResponse
{
"name": "operations/operation_id1"
}
Change payment plan on Google Workspace entitlements
Before you begin
Google Workspace entitlements with a Free or Trial
payment plan do not have a
Google Workspace billing account. In order to change the payment plan for an
Entitlement to a paid payment plan, there are a couple of additional steps to
select a Google Workspace billing account.
To change payment plan on Google Workspace entitlements, follow these
steps:
The first two steps are only required if the existing Entitlement has a Free
or Trial payment plan.
With the Offer, use
the lookupOffer
method to find Sku information on
the Offer.
LookupOfferRequest
{
"entitlement": "accounts/123/customers/abc/entitlements/entitlement_id1"
}
LookupOffer respones
{
"name": "accounts/123/offers/offer_id1",
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/sku_id1",
}
}
With the Customer and Sku, use the queryEligibleBillingAccounts method to
find a set of BillingAccount that can be used to pay for this
Entitlement. If you want to pay in a specific currency, select a
BillingAccount with
that currency.
QueryEligibleBillingAccountsRequest
{
"customer" : "accounts/123/customers/abc" ,
"skus" : [ "products/product_id/skus/sku_id1" ]
}
QueryEligibleBillingAccountsResponse
{
"skuPurchaseGroups" : [
{
"skus" : [
"products/product_id/skus/sku_id1"
],
"billingAccountPurchaseInfos" : [
{
"billingAccount" : {
"name" : "accounts/123/billingAccounts/billing_account_id1" ,
"displayName" : "Google_Workspace_USD_US_1" ,
"currencyCode" : "USD" ,
"regionCode" : "US"
}
},
{
"billingAccount" : {
"name" : "accounts/123/billingAccounts/billing_account_id2" ,
"displayName" : "Google_Workspace_CAD_CA_1" ,
"currencyCode" : "CAD" ,
"regionCode" : "CA"
}
}
]
}
]
}
```
With the Entitlement and BillingAccount, use the listPurchasableOffers
method to find any PurchasableOffer. The BillingAccount is not needed if the
existing entitlement already has a paid plan, in this case, the existing
BillingAccount will be used. To change the payment plan, the
purchase_option field needs to
be changeOfferPurchase
ListPurchasableOffersRequest
{
"customer": "accounts/123/customers/abc",
"changeOfferPurchase": {
"entitlement": "accounts/123/customers/abc/entitlements/entitlement_id1",
"billingAccount": "accounts/123/billingAccounts/billing_account_id2"
}
}
ListPurchasableOffersResponse
{
"purchasableOffers": [
{
"offer": {
"name": "accounts/123/offers/offer_id1",
},
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/sku_id1",
},
"plan": {
"paymentPlan": "FLEXIBLE",
"paymentCycle": {
"duration": 1,
"periodType": "MONTH"
}
},
"priceReferenceId": "price_reference_id_123"
}
],
}
At this point you should have the Entitlement, Offer and the BillingAccount.
Begin to change the payment plan by using
the changeOffer
method. Populate the price reference ID in the entitlement when it's present
in the PurchasableOffer to ensure that the new entitlement has the
above-quoted price. Without this price reference ID, there is no guarantee
that the discount and effective price returned from the
ListPurchasableOffersResponse will be the same in this ChangeOffer call.
Populating this price reference ID ensures a pricing match in this new
entitlement.
ChangeOfferRequest
{
"name": "accounts/abc/customers/123/entitlements/entitlement_id1",
"offer": "accounts/abc/offers/offer_id1",
"billing_account": "accounts/abc/billingAccounts/billing_account_id2",
"parameters": [{
"name": "max_units",
"value": {
"int64Value": "100"
}
}],
"priceReferenceId": "price_reference_id_123"
}
ChangeOfferResponse
{
"name": "operations/operation_id1"
}
Upgrade or downgrade Google Workspace entitlements
To upgrade or downgrade Google Workspace entitlements, follow these
steps:
With the Entitlement, call the listPurchasableSkus method to retrieve a
list of PurchasableSkus that can be used for upgrade or downgrade.
ListPurchasableSkusRequest
{
"customer": "accounts/123/customers/abc",
"changeOfferPurchase": {
"entitlement": "accounts/123/customers/abc/entitlements/entitlement_id1",
"changeType": "UPGRADE"
}
}
ListPurchasableSkusResponse
{
"purchasableSkus": [
{
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/sku_id1",
"product": {
"name": "products/product_id",
}
}
},
{
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/sku_id2",
"product": {
"name": "products/product_id",
},
}
}
]
}
With the PurchasableSku, use the queryEligibleBillingAccounts method to
find a set of BillingAccounts that can be used to pay for the Entitlement.
If you want to pay in a specific currency, select a BillingAccount with
that currency.
QueryEligibleBillingAccountsRequest
{
"customer" : "accounts/123/customers/abc" ,
"skus" : [ "products/product_id/skus/sku_id1" ]
}
QueryEligibleBillingAccountsResponse
{
"skuPurchaseGroups" : [
{
"skus" : [
"products/product_id/skus/sku_id1"
],
"billingAccountPurchaseInfos" : [
{
"billingAccount" : {
"name" : "accounts/123/billingAccounts/billing_account_id1" ,
"displayName" : "Google_Workspace_USD_US_1" ,
"currencyCode" : "USD" ,
"regionCode" : "US"
}
},
{
"billingAccount" : {
"name" : "accounts/123/billingAccounts/billing_account_id2" ,
"displayName" : "Google_Workspace_CAD_CA_1" ,
"currencyCode" : "CAD" ,
"regionCode" : "CA"
}
}
]
}
]
}
```
With the Entitlement and BillingAccount, use the listPurchasableOffers method to find any PurchasableOffer.
ListPurchasableOffersRequest
{
"customer": "accounts/123/customers/abc",
"changeOfferPurchase": {
"entitlement": "accounts/123/customers/abc/entitlements/entitlement_id1",
"billingAccount": "accounts/123/billingAccounts/billing_account_id2"
}
}
ListPurchasableOffersResponse
{
"purchasableOffers": [
{
"offer": {
"name": "accounts/123/offers/offer_id1",
},
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/sku_id1",
},
"plan": {
"paymentPlan": "FLEXIBLE",
"paymentCycle": {
"duration": 1,
"periodType": "MONTH"
}
},
"priceReferenceId": "price_reference_id_123"
}
],
}
```
At this point you should have the Entitlement, PurchasableOffer and the
BillingAccount. Begin to upgrade or downgrade by using the changeOffer
method.
Create an Entitlement object and populate the name, offer, billingAccount
and any required parameters. Populate the price reference ID in the
entitlement when it's present in the PurchasableOffer to ensure that the
new entitlement has the above-quoted price. Without this price reference
ID, there is no guarantee that the discount and effective price returned
from the ListPurchasableOffersResponse will be the same in this
ChangeOffer call. Populating this price reference ID ensures a pricing
match in this new entitlement.
ChangeOfferRequest
{
"name": "accounts/abc/customers/123/entitlements/entitlement_id1",
"offer": "accounts/abc/offers/offer_id1",
"billing_account": "accounts/abc/billingAccounts/billing_account_id2",
"parameters": [{
"name": "max_units",
"value": {
"int64Value": "100"
}
}],
"priceReferenceId": "price_reference_id_123"
}
ChangeOfferResponse
{
"name": "operations/operation_id1"
}
```
Transfer entitlements
This section helps you transfer entitlements for existing
Google Workspace and Chrome customers from their previous
partner.
For help transferring customers in the Partner Sales Console, see our guides
on transferring customers to
a partner account
or
a Google account
Google Workspace customers can only purchase entitlements from a single
partner or a single partner and Google.
During the transfer, existing entitlements are automatically canceled before
they are created again under the new partner. If a customer has commitment plan
entitlements, those will start a new commitment term after the transfer.
Before you begin
To manage entitlements for a customer, you need a customer-generated
transfer token .
Contact the customer and provide your
Partner Public Identifier
so they can generate a transfer token. After they create a token, the customer
needs to send their transfer token back to you to complete the process. These
tokens expire 14 days after creation. You also need the customer's domain
or Cloud Identity ID.
When the customer creates their transfer token, they select the entitlements
they want to transfer to their new reseller. You need to transfer all the
selected entitlements during the process.
To transfer entitlements, follow these steps:
If you only have the customer's domain, you can use the Cloud Channel API to
return their Cloud Identity ID. Call
checkCloudIdentityAccountsExist
with the customer's domain and, if the domain exists, the API will return the
customer's Cloud Identity ID.
Begin the transfer by using the
customers.import
method to import the customer's data.
ImportCustomerRequest
{
"parent": "accounts/abc",
"domain": "domain"
}
With the customer's Cloud Identity ID, call
listTransferableSkus
to retrieve a list of the customer's
transferableSku
Check each
object's transferEligibility
to make sure you can purchase the associated SKU.
ListTransferableSkusRequest
{
"parent": "accounts/abc",
"cloudIdentityId": "cloud_identity_id"
}
ListTransferableSkusResponse
{
"transferableSku": [
{
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/voice_sku_id1",
},
},
{
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/google_workspace_sku_id2",
},
},
{
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/google_workspace_chrome_sku_id3",
},
}
],
}
Now that you have a list of TransferableSkus, you need to determine what
BillingAccount to use to pay for the entitlements. Use the
queryEligibleBillingAccounts method to find a set of BillingAccount that
can
be used for each
TransferableSku.
Note that certain TransferableSkus must share the same Google Workspace
billing account,
which is why queryEligibleBillingAccounts returns a sku group that
informs you which TransferableSkus need to use the same BillingAccount.
If there are multiple Google Workspace billing account for a given SKU
group, you can pick one of the Google Workspace billing account and use
it for every TransferableSku in the group.
QueryEligibleBillingAccountsRequest
{
"customer" : "accounts/123/customers/abc" ,
"skus" : [ "products/product_id/skus/voice_sku_id1" , "products/product_id/skus/google_workspace_sku_id2" , "google_workspace_chrome_sku_id3" ]
}
QueryEligibleBillingAccountsResponse
{
"skuPurchaseGroups" : [
{
"skus" : [
"products/product_id/skus/voice_sku_id1"
],
"billingAccountPurchaseInfos" : [
{
"billingAccount" : {
"name" : "accounts/123/billingAccounts/voice_billing_account_id1" ,
"displayName" : "Google_Workspace_Voice_USD_US_1" ,
"currencyCode" : "USD" ,
"regionCode" : "US"
}
}
]
},
{
"skus" : [
"products/product_id/skus/google_workspace_sku_id2" , "google_workspace_chrome_sku_id3"
],
"billingAccountPurchaseInfos" : [
{
"billingAccount" : {
"name" : "accounts/123/billingAccounts/gw_billing_account_id1" ,
"displayName" : "Google_Workspace_USD_US_1" ,
"currencyCode" : "USD" ,
"regionCode" : "US"
}
},
{
"billingAccount" : {
"name" : "accounts/123/billingAccounts/gw_billing_account_id2" ,
"displayName" : "Google_Workspace_CAD_CA_1" ,
"currencyCode" : "CAD" ,
"regionCode" : "CA"
}
}
]
}
]
}
```
For each TransferableSku and BillingAccount pairs, use
the listTransferableOffers
method to find
available TransferableOffers
. At this point you should have the customer's list of tuples consisting of
TransferableSku, BillingAccounts, and TransferableOffer.
ListTransferableOffersRequest
{
"parent": "accounts/abc",
"cloudIdentityId": "cloud_identity_id",
"sku": "products/product_id/skus/voice_sku_id1",
"billingAccount": "ccounts/123/billingAccounts/voice_billing_account_id1"
}
ListTransferableOffersResponse
{
"transferableOffers": [
{
"offer": {
"name": "accounts/123/offers/voice_offer_id1",
},
"sku": {
"name": "products/product_id/skus/voice_sku_id1",
},
"plan": {
"paymentPlan": "FLEXIBLE",
"paymentCycle": {
"duration": 1,
"periodType": "MONTH"
}
},
"priceReferenceId": "price_reference_id_voice_offer_12"
}
],
}
For each tuple create a new corresponding Entitlement object, each
Entitlement needs an Offer, BillingAccount and any required parameters.
Populate the price reference ID in the entitlement when it's present in the
PurchasableOffer to ensure that the new entitlement has the above-quoted
price. Without this price reference ID, there is no guarantee that the
discount and effective price returned from the ListPurchasableOffersResponse
will be the same in this TransferEntitlements call. Populating this price reference ID
ensures a pricing match in this new entitlement.
To perform the transfer, call the
transferEntitlements
method.
TransferEntitlementsRequest
{
"parent": "accounts/abc/customers/123",
"entitlements": [
{
"offer": "accounts/123/offers/voice_offer_id1",
"maxUnits": 100,
"billingAccount": "accounts/123/billingAccounts/voice_billing_account_id1",
"priceReferenceId": "price_reference_id_voice_offer_12"
},
{
"offer": "accounts/123/offers/gw_offer_id2",
"maxUnits": 150,
"billingAccount": "accounts/123/billingAccounts/gw_billing_account_id1"
}
{
"offer": "accounts/123/offers/gw_chrome_offer_id3",
"maxUnits": 200,
"billingAccount": "accounts/123/billingAccounts/gw_billing_account_id1",
"priceReferenceId": "price_reference_id_chrome_offer_34"
}
]
}
TransferEntitlementsResponse
{
"name": "operations/operation_id1"
}
