Export Channel Services data to BigQuery
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Note: This export is only available to Google Cloud and Google Workspace
partners.
This page shows you how to configure a Channel Services export, and also
describes the available schema for an export.
Using BigQuery , you can export
Channel Services billing data to a specified
BigQuery dataset . This data can
help you perform a detailed analysis of how your customers or channel partners
are using the services you provide.
Exports from Channel Services contain reseller-specific data not otherwise
included in Cloud Billing exports. This includes costs, credits, and usage
data with your configured repricing rules. These exports also aggregate all
information about your customers' parent billing accounts into a single dataset.
However, data from a Channel Services export is compatible with
Cloud Billing exports, and you can use queries to join both datasets
for analysis.
For information about non-reseller Cloud Billing exports, see
setting up Cloud Billing exports to BigQuery .
Before you begin
Before you start exporting Channel Services billing data, you must:
Set up a project to host your BigQuery dataset. Make sure that
billing is enabled
on the project.
Enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service API on the project.
Create a dataset for your exported data.
If you already have a project and BigQuery dataset for
Cloud Billing data exports
, you can reuse that project and dataset for the Channel Services export.
For detailed information on setting up a project and dataset, see
Set up Cloud Billing data export to BigQuery .
Permissions required for exports
To enable and configure Channel Services exports, you need the following roles:
For BigQuery, if you created the target dataset, you need
BigQuery User for the project that contains the dataset. If the dataset
was created by someone else, you need the BigQuery Data Owner role.
To enable Google Cloud exports, in the Partner Sales Console, you
must have the Google Cloud Reseller administrator role.
Learn about assigning Google Cloud roles in the
Partner Sales Console
To enable Google Workspace exports, you must be a Reseller Admin or
have the Google Workspace Billing privileges.
Learn about assigning Google Workspace roles in the
Partner Sales Console
(Optional) Project Viewer for the project that contains the target
BigQuery dataset, to automatically check if
billing is enabled on the project .
Select a project and dataset
In the Partner Sales Console, select a project and dataset in
BigQuery to store the Channel Services data. Enable billing
on the project if not already enabled.
When you select or
create a BigQuery dataset ,
you can choose one of the supported BigQuery locations for the
dataset. When you enable the Channel Services data export for the first
time per data source (Google Cloud or Google Workspace):
If you configure your BigQuery dataset to use a multi-region location ,
BigQuery export data is available for each selected data
source from the start of the previous month. For example, if you enable
BigQuery export on September 23rd, your export will include
data beginning August 1st.
If you configure your BigQuery dataset to use a region location
(other than multi-region US or EU), your BigQuery export data
is available for each selected data source from the date you enable the
export, and after. That is, BigQuery export data isn't added
retroactively for non-multi-region dataset locations, so you won't see
BigQuery export data from before you enable export.
Note: For the Offline order billing export (preview), the export only supports
multi-region dataset locations.
Warning : For Partners who disable
and later re-enable the BigQuery export or change Export dataset
to a different BigQuery location, data might not be available for
the period when export was explicitly disabled or between the last export and
when cross-region dataset change occurred. We cannot backfill data in these
cases.
To export billing data for multiple Partner Sales Console accounts, follow
these steps:
On the BigQuery dataset that you want to export your data to,
make sure the Billing Administrators for each Partner Sales Console
account have permissions to view the dataset.
When you set up the billing data export in each Partner Sales Console
account, select the unified dataset.

Enable export
Before you enable the data export, note your fully-qualified dataset ID, which
is in the format PROJECT_ID : DATASET_NAME .
Caution: If you haven't previously
enabled Billing
on the project, BigQuery may run in the sandbox mode, which may
cause exports to behave unexpectedly. Learn about
upgrading from the BigQuery sandbox
.
To enable the Channel Services export:
In the Partner Sales Console, open the
Billing page .
Select Billing export .
Enter the fully-qualified dataset ID in the Rebilling dataset field.
Select the Data sources to export data for.
Click Update . If you see a prompt to update dataset permissions, click
Update .
After it's set up, the billing export delivers incremental usage data daily. The
export table won't show up until the billing export runs for your account for
the first time. The dataset contains data from when it was first configured to
retain data.
Warning : Don't modify exported data
tables.
Modifying these tables can cause data exports to stop. Data added manually is
lost until you revert your changes or delete the table. If you want to blend
data from previous Cloud Billing exports to BigQuery, we
recommend keeping the data in separate tables and using a UNION
query instead.
To stop exporting rebilling cost data to the dataset, click Disable billing
data export on the Customer rebilling page. To re-enable exporting, follow
the previous steps to specify a dataset ID.
Rebilling cost data may be unavailable for the duration it was disabled. If you
deleted any exported data during that time, we cannot backfill the deleted
records.
Required service account permissions
The Channel Services data export uses a service account that is owned and
managed by Google, and has permission to write billing records to a table. The
service account is:
cloud-channel-billing-reporting-rebilling@system.gserviceaccount.com
This service account requires the
predefined role: roles/bigquery.dataEditor
to allow exports. You can configure the permissions by following the steps to
enable export .
Warning : Removing this service
account while billing exports to BigQuery are enabled might
result in lost data.
If you remove the service account, you must add the service account again
or re-configure the dataset permission by clicking the Update
button on the Billing export page. We can't backfill deleted
or exported records if you remove exported data, or if you redirect your export
to a different dataset.
Query data efficiently
The BigQuery table is partitioned by export_time and clustered
by payer_billing_account_id by default. This means that the table is divided
into smaller partitions, each of which is further divided into smaller clusters.
Using the partition and cluster keys
in a query will help BigQuery to quickly locate the relevant data, which can
significantly reduce the cost of the query.
For example, this query is efficient compared to a query without partitioning
and clustering keys:
SELECT
billing_account_id
currency ,
invoice . month ,
-- Divide by currency_conversion_rate if converting non-USD to USD.
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM (
IFNULL (
( SELECT SUM ( c . amount ) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) AS c ), 0 ))
AS total
FROM PROJECT_ID . DATASET_NAME . reseller_billing_detailed_export_v1
WHERE
export_time BETWEEN TIMESTAMP ( START_DATE )
AND TIMESTAMP ( END_DATE )
AND payer_billing_account_id IN ( PAYER_BILLING_ACCOUNT_IDS )
GROUP BY
billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month
ORDER BY
billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month ;
For more information on partitioning, clustering, and best practices, see the
following links:
Query Partitioned tables
Query Clustered tables
Optimize query computation
Best Practices to control costs in BigQuery
Finding payer's billing account ID
To find the payer's billing account ID, open the
billing accounts page of the Partner Sales Console
and click the Partner billing tab.
You can see all the billing accounts and the payer billing account ids.
Setting up access controls for other users on the export dataset
There are multiple ways to set up access controls on the data in
BigQuery export. For more information, see the
BigQuery access controls .
To make sure that users only have access to data that they're authorized to
view, we recommend setting up
Authorized views to share data from your
exported dataset.
Caution: Don't use row-level or
column-level access control on the
dataset. Enabling these access control features causes the billing data export
to fail.
For continuous data export, when you set up permissions for users, make sure
that the service account
cloud-channel-billing-reporting-rebilling@system.gserviceaccount.com
always has full editor access on the export dataset.
Table schema
Warning : Attempting to modify the
export schema yourself can result in data no longer getting exported. If you
want to add or remove columns, you can create a
view or a
materialized view , or you
can join against your other tables in your queries.
If your table gets in this state, you must revert it back to having all of
the correct columns and nothing else. Afterwards, you might need to go to the
Billing export page and click Update .
The following schema describes the data in the BigQuery table.
In your BigQuery dataset, the detailed rebilling export is loaded
into a data table named reseller_billing_detailed_export_v1 .

Other notes about Google Workspace export
There are several special behaviors with Google Workspace exports:
Google Workspace data doesn't contain the reseller's own usage.
When cost_type is tax and adjustment , usage.amount_in_pricing_units
is always 1.
On Google Workspace invoices, taxes are shown as one line-item. In
the export, taxes are broken down by customer. While the total tax should
match the invoice, individual taxes might contain minor rounding
inaccuracies.
billing_account_id
For Google Cloud, this is the Cloud Billing account that the
usage is associated with.
For Google Workspace, this is the Cloud Identity of the
customer .
For offline orders, this is name of the customer.
service and sku
For Google Workspace, these columns represent the "Product" and "SKU"
associated with the usage.
Learn more about Product & SKU IDs
.
For Google Workspace consumptive SKUs (Google Voice and
Drive), the sku.id and service.id columns contain null .
Note: For legacy Google Drive SKUs, sku.description may not match the
"Subscription" column in the invoice CSV (for example, the CSV shows "Google
Drive storage 20 GB" but sku.description shows 20 GB ). This is expected for
legacy Google Drive SKUs. This value can be found on the
Partner Sales Console. Navigate to a specific Customer, click the legacy
subscription, and click "See payment plan". You should then see values that
correspond to sku.description .
usage_start_time and usage_end_time
In the Google Workspace invoice CSV, this is represented as dates. In
the exports, these are represented as timestamps:
For usage_start_time , this is the start time (inclusive) of the
subscription, at 0:00 PST on the start date.
For usage_end_time , this is the end time (exclusive) of the subscription,
at 0:00 PST on the day after the end date.
project.labels
For Google Cloud, these are the key:value pairs on the
Google Cloud project where the usage occurred. For more information, see
Using Labels
.
labels
For Google Cloud, these are the key:value pairs on the Google Cloud
resource where the usage occurred. For more information, see
Using Labels
.
system_labels
For Google Cloud, these are the key:value pairs on the
Google Cloud resource where the usage occurred. For more information,
see
Available system labels .
For Google Workspace, these are additional metadata regarding the
cost, which includes:
workspace.googleapis.com/domain_name : The domain name of the customer.
workspace.googleapis.com/order_id : The order ID.
workspace.googleapis.com/purchase_order_id : The purchase order (PO)
ID.
workspace.googleapis.com/subscription_id : The subscription ID.
workspace.googleapis.com/usage_type : The type of usage. Not applicable
if cost_type isn't regular .
Note: For Google Workspace consumptive SKUs Google Voice and
Drive), only workspace.googleapis.com/domain_name and
workspace.googleapis.com/subscription_id are populated.
The Google Workspace usage types include:
COMMITMENT_TERM_START_ITEM : Beginning of a subscription. Typically
associated with a partial month for a monthly billed commitment subscription
and for the billing or contract period for a prepaid subscription.
COMMITMENT_TERM_END_ITEM : End of a subscription. Typically associated with
the last month charges of a monthly billed commitment subscription.
COMMITMENT_TERM_RENEWAL_ITEM : Start of a follow-on subscription period.
COMMITMENT_MONTHLY_ITEM : Usage recorded for commitments existing at the
start of the month. In most cases, the charge will extend throughout the
entire month.
COMMITMENT_SEATS_CHANGE_ITEM : Recorded when the commitment level changes
(either increase or decrease). Often starts mid-month and extends to the end
of the month for a monthly billed commitment subscription or until the end
of the billing or contract period for a prepaid subscription.
COMMITMENT_CANCEL_ITEM : Recorded when a subscription is cancelled.
Includes charges associated with early termination. Represents either a
charge for the remainder of the contract period when contract is cancelled
mid-way or a credit issued for the remainder of the billing period when a
contracted is changed or cancelled mid-way.
FLEXIBLE_SEATS_ITEM : Records usage by for some number of users for a
contiguous block of some number of days. Only intended for users without a
commitment.
COUPON_DISCOUNT_ITEM : Discount amount associated with a coupon.
MIGRATED_CREDIT_ITEM : Credit from postini migration.
COMMITMENT_PREPAY_BILLING_PERIOD_ITEM : Represents a usage info that is
created at the start of the payment cycle for the entire cycle for a
commitment prepay subscription.
usage.amount
For Google Workspace seat-based usage, this indicates paid seats. For
example, committed seats for commitments or number of seats paid for flex.
For Google Workspace consumptive SKUs (Google Voice and
Drive), this is the number of minutes used.
usage.pricing_unit
