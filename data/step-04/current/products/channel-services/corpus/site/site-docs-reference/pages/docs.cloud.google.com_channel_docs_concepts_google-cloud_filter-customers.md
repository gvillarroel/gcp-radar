Set up a customer filter using the ListCustomers API
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
If you need to find information about a specific customer, you can use the
Cloud Channel API filter parameter through the
customers.list method .
If you use a filter, there is a short delay (usually a few seconds) during the
creation of a customer. If you need access to a customer immediately after
creation, we recommend using customers.list without a filter or
customers.get .
Available filters
Strings for the filter parameter support exact match, or exact match plus prefix
filtering. Filters are not case sensitive.
The following table describes the
available fields you can search for, and the methods they support.

Exact match support
Prefix support
domain
Yes
Yes
org_display_name
Yes
Yes
cloud_identity_id
Yes
No
channel_partner_id
Yes
No
You can find the complete filter syntax in the
API filtering guide .
Exact match syntax
Exact match filters will only find customers that contain the same fields as
those in the submitted string.
Syntax:
<domain | org_display_name | cloud_identity_id | channel_partner_id> = <value>
Example: domain = "domain.com" AND channel_partner_id = "12345"
Prefix syntax
Prefix filters allow the use of an asterisk as a wild-card symbol. This filter
will find customers that have fields with the prefix, regardless of the content
that comes after it.
Syntax: <domain | org_display_name> : <value>*
Example: domain : "uw.com*" AND org_display_name : "prefix*"
Examples of filters with logical operators
Cloud Channel API filters support the use of AND and OR logical operators.
You can use both operators in one filter by using a parenthetical statement.
AND example
domain = "domain.com" AND channel_partner_id = "12345" AND org_display_name :
"display*"
OR example
domain = "domain.com" OR channel_partner_id = "12345" OR org_display_name :
"display*"
AND + OR example
domain = "domain.com" OR (channel_partner_id = "12345" AND org_display_name :
"display*" )
You need to use parentheses if the filter contains an AND and an OR statement.
The following example is not a valid filter string.
domain = "domain.com" OR channel_partner_id = "12345" AND org_display_name :
"display*
