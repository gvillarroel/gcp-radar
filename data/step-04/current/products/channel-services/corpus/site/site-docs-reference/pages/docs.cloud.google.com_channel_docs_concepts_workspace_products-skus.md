Google Workspace products, SKUs, and plans
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Plans
Several payment plans are available, including:
Annual/Monthly: Annual commitment with monthly, post-paid payments
Annual/Yearly: Annual commitment with yearly pre-payment
Flexible: Non-commitment plan with post-paid monthly payments
Perpetual: One-time, non-recurring payment
Free trial plan
Trial length is variable up to a maximum of 30 days.
For more information on these plans, see our page on
Choosing a payment plan for your customers .
Key Point: These plans do not define the billing relationship between a reseller
and their customers. Resellers define their own billing terms with their
customers.

Upgrades and Downgrades
For new customers, create a new entitlement with the
entitlements.create
method.
You can upgrade an entitlement using the
entitlements.changeOffer
method with an offer for the SKU that you want to upgrade to.
It isn't possible to upgrade Annual/Yearly subscriptions, but you can
switch to Flexible using the entitlements.changeRenewalSettings
method, then perform an adjustment after the renewal event.
You can downgrade an entitlement using the
entitlements.changeOffer
method with an offer for the SKU that you want to downgrade to.
It isn't possible to downgrade Annual/Monthly and Annual/Yearly
entitlements during term, and it cannot be done via renewal settings:
the downgrade must be done manually on or after renewal time. We recommend that
you switch to Flexible via entitlements.changeRenewalSettings ,
then perform an adjustment after the renewal event.
See more details about downgrades on this Help Center article .
Transfer and SKU switch operations cannot be combined. For example, if you
have a potential customer who is using Business Starter and wants
to buy Enterprise Standard from you, you must transfer the customer first
with the existing Business Starter SKU and then switch the SKU to
Enterprise Standard.
Upgrades/downgrades start a new entitlement and terminates the previous one.
For commit plans, a new commitment starts when the call to
entitlements.changeOffer is made,
and does not co-term with the existing entitlement.
Caution: Payment plans impact how upgrades and downgrades work.
Read above for details.
