BigQuery export query examples
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page provides examples of how to query Channel Services data exported to a
BigQuery dataset.
For more information about the Channel Services data export, see
how to set up Channel Services data export to BigQuery .
For additional troubleshooting tips, see
Troubleshoot issues with BigQuery exports .
Identifying and accessing the BigQuery table
Channel Services exports are set up using the
Partner Sales Console .
The table's name uses the format: PROJECT_ID . DATASET_NAME .reseller_billing_detailed_export_v1
To let other users view a Channel Services export, you must
apply the correct permissions . For example, you
can assign the bigquery.dataViewer role to your credentials on the project,
dataset, or the table itself.
Query examples
The following examples include a sample query and a basic explanation of how to
interpret the results. The results contain Google Cloud usage costs for
every configured Customer or channel partner in the
Partner Sales Console.
Note: You can also use the BigQuery API to execute queries and
programmatically retrieve query results.

Sum of partner costs by billing account
You can use this query to verify an invoice you receive from Google. The values
cost and credit.amount are the sums for all rows. These include usage costs,
taxes, adjustments, and rounding errors.
SELECT
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM (
IFNULL (
( SELECT SUM ( c . amount ) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) AS c ), 0 ))
AS total
FROM ` PROJECT_ID . DATASET_NAME . reseller_billing_detailed_export_v1 `
WHERE
export_time BETWEEN TIMESTAMP ( START_DATE )
AND TIMESTAMP ( END_DATE )
GROUP BY
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month
ORDER BY
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month ;
Sum of customer costs by Cloud Billing subaccount
You can use this query to summarize billable usage for each customer. The values
customer_cost and credit.customer_amount show the sums of all rows that
represent usage costs. Rows that represent taxes, adjustments, and rounding show
a null value.
For credits where type is set to RESELLER_MARGIN , its customer_amount is
set to zero to make sure the margin isn't visible in customer billing.
The values customer_cost and credit.customer_amount show your Repricing
configurations. For example, if the RebillingBasis for a particular customer's
Google Cloud entitlement is set to Direct Customer Cost minus 5% , the
customer_cost value is 0.95 multiplied by cost . This reflects the configured
reduction from your cost.
The results of this query contain each Cloud Billing subaccount, its
associated
Partner Sales customer
resource name, invoice month, and total billable usage.
SELECT
customer_name ,
billing_account_id ,
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month ,
SUM ( customer_cost )
+ SUM (
IFNULL (
( SELECT SUM ( c . customer_amount ) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) AS c ), 0 ))
AS total
FROM ` PROJECT_ID . DATASET_NAME . reseller_billing_detailed_export_v1 `
WHERE
export_time BETWEEN TIMESTAMP ( START_DATE )
AND TIMESTAMP ( END_DATE )
GROUP BY
customer_name ,
billing_account_id ,
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month
ORDER BY
customer_name ,
billing_account_id ,
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month ;
Sum of customer costs by Cloud Billing subaccount, as shown to the subaccount owner
This query shows you how the data cost numbers map with what a resold customer
(or you as the partner) sees when they open the Google Cloud console for their
subaccount.
For credits where type is set to RESELLER_MARGIN , this is hidden in
SBA view.
For costs where cost_type is tax , this is hidden in SBA view. The
Reseller is supposed to add applicable Taxes separately to their Resold's
invoices.
Occasionally, cost_at_list could be null for some records, causing this result
to differ from what you see in the Google Cloud console. If this happens, use
IFNULL(cost_at_list, cost) instead. For more information, see
Charges without list costs .
SELECT
customer_name ,
currency ,
SUM ( cost_at_list ) AS list_cost ,
SUM ( cost - cost_at_list ) AS negotiated_savings ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM (
IFNULL (
(
SELECT
SUM ( c . amount )
FROM
UNNEST ( credits ) AS c
WHERE
c . type != 'RESELLER_MARGIN'
),
0 )) AS total
FROM
` PROJECT_ID . DATASET_NAME . reseller_billing_detailed_export_v1 `
WHERE
cost_type != 'tax'
AND billing_account_id = ' BILLING_SUBACCOUNT_ID '
AND invoice . month = ' YYYYMM '
GROUP BY
customer_name ,
currency
ORDER BY
customer_name ,
currency ;
Sum of channel partner costs by billing account
If you are a distributor, you can use this query to summarize billable usage for
each channel partner. The values channel_partner_cost and
credit.channel_partner_amount show the sum of all rows that represent usage
costs. Rows that represent taxes, adjustments, and rounding show a null value.
For credits where type is set to RESELLER_MARGIN , its
channel_partner_amount is set to zero to make sure the margin isn't visible in
channel partner billing.
The values channel_partner_cost and credit.channel_partner_amount show your
Repricing configurations. For example, if the RebillingBasis for a particular
channel partner is set to Direct Customer Cost minus 5% , the
channel_partner_cost value is 0.95 multiplied by cost . This reflects the
configured reduction from your cost.
The results of this query contain each billing account, the channel partner
resource_name attached to customers under that billing account, the invoice
month, and total billable usage.
SELECT
channel_partner_name ,
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month ,
SUM ( channel_partner_cost )
+ SUM (
IFNULL (
( SELECT SUM ( c . channel_partner_amount ) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) AS c ), 0 ))
AS total
FROM ` PROJECT_ID . DATASET_NAME . reseller_billing_detailed_export_v1 `
WHERE
export_time BETWEEN TIMESTAMP ( START_DATE )
AND TIMESTAMP ( END_DATE )
GROUP BY
channel_partner_name ,
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month
ORDER BY
channel_partner_name ,
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month ;
Sum of costs not assigned to a customer
You can use this query to summarize costs not linked to a Channel Services
customer, but that may represent usage billable to other customers. The values
cost and credit.amount show the sum of all rows where the
billing_account_id and payer_billing_account_id are different. The
billing_account_id represents the Cloud Billing subaccount.
For credits where type is set to RESELLER_MARGIN , this query excludes the
credit amount. The credit amount is intended for your allocation and isn't
considered a customer cost. The RESELLER_MARGIN amount is included in your
cost and reflected on invoices sent by Google.
SELECT
billing_account_id ,
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM (
IFNULL (
( SELECT SUM ( c . amount ) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) AS c WHERE c . type != 'RESELLER_MARGIN' ), 0 ))
AS total
FROM ` PROJECT_ID . DATASET_NAME . reseller_billing_detailed_export_v1 `
WHERE
export_time BETWEEN TIMESTAMP ( START_DATE )
AND TIMESTAMP ( END_DATE )
AND customer_name IS NULL
GROUP BY
billing_account_id ,
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month
ORDER BY
billing_account_id ,
payer_billing_account_id ,
currency ,
invoice . month ;
Google Workspace data view similar to invoice CSV
If you are a Google Workspace reseller, you may get a view of the
Google Workspace billing data with similar columns as the invoice CSV
files.
SELECT
(
SELECT
ws_labels . value
FROM
UNNEST ( system_labels ) AS ws_labels
WHERE
ws_labels . key = 'workspace.googleapis.com/domain_name'
) AS domain_name ,
billing_account_id AS customer_id ,
sku . description AS sku_name ,
sku . id AS sku_id ,
(
SELECT
ws_labels . value
FROM
UNNEST ( system_labels ) AS ws_labels
WHERE
ws_labels . key = 'workspace.googleapis.com/usage_type'
) AS description ,
(
SELECT
ws_labels . value
FROM
UNNEST ( system_labels ) AS ws_labels
WHERE
ws_labels . key = 'workspace.googleapis.com/order_id'
) AS order_name ,
FORMAT_TIMESTAMP ( '%b %d' , usage_start_time , 'America/Los_Angeles' )
AS start_date ,
FORMAT_TIMESTAMP (
'%b %d' ,
TIMESTAMP_SUB ( usage_end_time , INTERVAL 1 MINUTE ),
'America/Los_Angeles' )
AS end_date ,
SUM ( usage . amount_in_pricing_unit ) AS quantity ,
(
SELECT ws_labels . value
FROM UNNEST ( system_labels ) AS ws_labels
WHERE ws_labels . key = 'workspace.googleapis.com/purchase_order_id'
) AS po_number ,
SUM ( cost ) AS amount ,
SUM ( cost_at_list ) AS list_amount ,
FROM ` PROJECT_ID . DATASET_NAME . reseller_billing_detailed_export_v1 `
WHERE
export_time BETWEEN TIMESTAMP ( START_DATE )
AND TIMESTAMP ( END_DATE )
AND payer_billing_account_id = ' EXTERNAL_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID '
AND invoice . month = ' INVOICE_MONTH '
GROUP BY
domain_name ,
customer_id ,
sku_name ,
sku_id ,
description ,
order_name ,
start_date ,
end_date ,
po_number
HAVING amount != 0
ORDER BY
domain_name ,
order_name ,
start_date ,
end_date ;
Other columns of interest to add to SELECT and GROUP BY clauses:
billing_account_id : Represents the Customer Cloud Identity ID.
customer_name : Represents the customer resource which can be used in API
calls.
channel_partner_name : (For distributors) Represents the channel partner.
entitlement_name : Resource name of the Entitlement in Channel Services.
customer_correlation_id : A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) ID that
you can define for a customer.
usage.amount : For Google Workspace seat-based usage, this
indicates paid seats. For example, purchased seats for commitments or number
of assigned seats for flex subscriptions.
The query result differs from the CSV invoice in the following ways:
The CSV "Description" column uses a human-readable string, whereas the
BigQuery export uses enum values.
The CSV "Start/End date" columns aren't zero-padded (e.g. May 1), whereas
the BigQuery query uses padded values (e.g. May 01). You may
also use the timestamp values directly. The usage_start_time is inclusive,
but the usage_end_time is exclusive.
The CSV has a single "Tax" line at the end, whereas the
BigQuery export has tax lines on the subscription-level that
sum up to the same amount as the CSV "Tax" line.
Offline order billing data view similar to invoice PDF (preview)
If you're a reseller who also places offline orders (orders that you don't use
the Partner Sales Console to place), you can get a view of billing data with
similar columns as the invoice CSV files.
SELECT
billing_account_id AS customer_name ,
service . description AS sku_name ,
sku . id AS sku_id ,
FORMAT_TIMESTAMP ( '%b %d' , usage_start_time , 'America/Los_Angeles' )
AS start_date ,
FORMAT_TIMESTAMP ( '%b %d' , usage_end_time , 'America/Los_Angeles' )
AS end_date ,
SUM ( usage . amount_in_pricing_unit ) AS quantity ,
SUM ( cost ) AS amount ,
FROM ` PROJECT_ID . DATASET_NAME . reseller_billing_offline_orders_detailed_export_v0 `
WHERE
export_time BETWEEN TIMESTAMP ( START_DATE )
AND TIMESTAMP ( END_DATE )
AND payer_billing_account_id = ' EXTERNAL_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID '
AND invoice . month = ' INVOICE_MONTH '
GROUP BY
customer_name ,
sku_name ,
sku_id ,
start_date ,
end_date
HAVING amount != 0
ORDER BY
customer_name ,
start_date ,
end_date ,
sku_id ;
The query result differs from the PDF invoice in the following ways:
You can convert the timestamp value to a date value in the
"America/Los_Angeles" timezone. Both the usage_start_time and the
usage_end_time are exclusive.
The PDF has a detailed tax breakdown of local versus state sales tax, where
the BigQuery export has tax lines on the subscription-level
that sum up to the tax amount for the whole subscription.
