Risk Engine feature support
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Premium and Enterprise service tiers (requires organization-level activation )
This page describes the services and findings that the Security Command Center
Risk Engine feature supports and the supportability limits it
is subject to.
Risk Engine generates attack exposure scores and attack path simulations
for the following:
Supported finding categories in the Vulnerability and Misconfiguration
finding classes .
Toxic combination class findings.
Chokepoint class findings.
Resource instances of supported resource types that you designate as
high value. For more information, see
Resource types supported in high-value resource sets .
Security Command Center can provide attack exposure scores and attack path
visualizations for multiple cloud service provider platforms. Detector support
differs for each cloud service provider. Risk Engine depends on
vulnerability and misconfiguration detectors that are specific to each cloud
service provider. The following sections describe the supported resources for
each cloud service provider.
Google Cloud
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Microsoft Azure
Organization-level support only
The attack path simulations that Risk Engine uses to
generate the attack exposure scores and
attack paths require Security Command Center to be activated at the
organization level .
Attack path simulations are not supported with
project-level activations
of Security Command Center.
To view attack paths, your Google Cloud console view must be set to
your organization. If you select a project or folder view in the
Google Cloud console, you can see attack exposure scores, but you
cannot see the attack paths.
Required roles
Attack paths are associated with specific components of Security Command Center, like
findings and high-value resources. To view Security Command Center attack paths,
you must have the correct IAM roles to let you view each of your
Security Command Center resources.
To get the permissions that
you need to view attack paths,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on your organization:
Security Center Attack Paths Reader ( roles/securitycenter.attackPathsViewer )
View attack paths generated from findings and issues (for example, toxic combinations and chokepoints):
Security Center Findings Viewer ( roles/securitycenter.findingsViewer )
Allow access to attack paths for high-value resources:
Security Center Assets Viewer ( roles/securitycenter.assetsViewer )
Security Center Valued Resources Reader ( roles/securitycenter.valuedResourcesViewer )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Size limits for organizations
For attack path simulations, Risk Engine limits the number of
active assets and active findings that an organization can contain.
If an organization exceeds the limits shown in the following table,
attack path simulations don't run.
Type of limit
Usage limit
Maximum number of active findings
250,000,000
Maximum number of active assets
26,000,000
If the assets, findings, or both in your organization are approaching
these limits or exceed them, contact Cloud Customer Care to request an
evaluation of your organization for a possible increase.
High-value resource set limits
A high-value resource set supports only certain resource types and can
contain only a certain number of resource instances.
A high-value resource set for a cloud service provider platform can
contain up to 1,000 resource instances.
You can create up to 100 resource value configurations per organization
on Google Cloud.
User interface support
You can work with attack exposure scores in either the Google Cloud console,
the Security Operations console, or the Security Command Center API.
You can work with attack exposure scores and attack paths for toxic
combination cases in the Security Operations console only.
You can create resource value configurations either on the
Attack path simulations tab of the Security Command Center Settings
page in the Google Cloud console, or through the Security Command Center API .

sqladmin.googleapis.com/Instance
storage.googleapis.com/Bucket
Supported finding categories
Attack path simulations generate attack exposure scores and attack paths
for only the Security Command Center finding categories from the
Security Command Center detection services that are listed in this section.
Risk Engine findings
The toxic combination and chokepoint findings categories that are generated by Risk Engine support attack exposure scores.
Vulnerability Assessment for Google Cloud findings

Pub/Sub notification support
Changes to attack exposure scores cannot be used as a trigger for
notifications to Pub/Sub.
Also, findings sent to Pub/Sub when the findings are created
don't include an attack exposure score because they are sent before a score
can be calculated.

Azure support
Risk Engine can generate attack exposure
scores and attack path visualizations for your resources on Microsoft Azure.
After you establish a connection to Azure ,
you can designate Azure high-value resources by creating
resource value configurations, as you would for resources on Google Cloud and
AWS. For instructions, see section Define and manage your high-value resource set .
Before you create your first resource value configuration for Azure, Security Command Center
uses a default high-value resource set that is specific to the cloud service provider.
Security Command Center runs simulations for a cloud platform that are independent of
simulations run for other cloud platforms.
