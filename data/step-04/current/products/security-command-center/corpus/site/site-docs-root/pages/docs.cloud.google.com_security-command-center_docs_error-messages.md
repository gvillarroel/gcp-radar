Web Security Scanner
To contact us about the error messages below,
send feedback about the specific scan.
Error message
Description
The app often redirected the scanner to an authentication page
If you're using Google authentication, the scanner detects auth redirects.
Most likely the credentials you're using to scan the site are invalid.
To check the validity of credentials, start a Chrome incognito session and
try to log in with the test credentials on your application.
The app produced a high number of errors during this scan
Web Security Scanner found that a high percentage of requests resulted
in 4xx or 5xx HTTP responses. Verify your
scanning credentials and the target URL. If the problem continues to
occur, file a bug .
The scan found a small number of results during crawling
Web Security Scanner didn't find many pages to test. This error is
expected for sites that don't often change the URL and sites that have
application features behind multi-step navigation bars. Try adding more
seed URLs, like the URL for each feature that a navigation bar leads to.
The scan found too many URLs while crawling results and has not tested all
of them.
This problem can appear if your app has many URLs that lead to the same
template. In this case,
file a feature request and the team might
be able to tune the duplicate-page logic for you.
An internal error occurred during the scan.
This message can indicate one or more internal errors. If you get this
message, send feedback about the specific
scan.
The scan timed out while crawling the app
There is a time limit for each stage of the crawler.
If you have a large site, then this error may occur.
File a feature request , and the team can
manually increase your crawl timeout.
If you have a small site, then something might have gone wrong with
the crawler. File a bug with your scan
details to request a review.
The scan triggered a DDOS protection mechanism and has been stopped
This error is caused by too many queries, too fast. Try reducing the
Queries Per Second (QPS).
Fixing issues
If Web Security Scanner reports an issue, you need to disable browser
cross-site scripting (XSS) protection and then verify the location. For more
information, see
Verify the issue .
Important: If you disable XSS protection in the browser, only use that browser
instance to test your own security issues.
