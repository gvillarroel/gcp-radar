VPC Service Controls at the
organization level.

The service account that you used to set up Assured OSS.
The Artifact Registry service agent
that was created automatically when you set up Assured OSS.
The user account that set up Assured OSS.

Complete this task for your Artifact Registry repositories and for the
Google Cloud resources that initiate downloads (for example,
Compute Engine VMs).
Configure the following egress rule:
- egressFrom :
