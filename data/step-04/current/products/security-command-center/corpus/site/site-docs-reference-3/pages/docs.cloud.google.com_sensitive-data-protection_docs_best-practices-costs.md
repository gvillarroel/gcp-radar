Keeping costs under control
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Sensitive Data Protection has many powerful capabilities, but depending on the quantity
of information that you instruct Sensitive Data Protection to scan, it is possible
for costs to become prohibitively high. This topic describes several methods
that you can use to keep costs down while also ensuring that you're using
Sensitive Data Protection to scan the exact data that you intend to.
Inspection
Google recommends the following practices to help you control your inspection
costs.
Use sampling to restrict the number of bytes inspected
If you are scanning BigQuery tables or Cloud Storage buckets,
Sensitive Data Protection can scan a small subset of the dataset. This can provide
a sampling of scan results without incurring the potential costs of scanning an
entire dataset.
Once you find a sample with sensitive data, you can schedule a second, more
exhaustive scan of that dataset to discover the entire list of findings.
For more information, see Limiting the amount of content
inspected in Inspecting storage and
databases for sensitive data .
Scan only data that has changed
You can instruct Sensitive Data Protection to avoid scanning data that hasn't
been modified since the last inspection. Setting a
timespan
lets you control what data to scan based on when the data was last modified.
If you're using job triggers , you can set the
flag enable_auto_population_of_timespan_config in TimespanConfig to
automatically skip content that was scanned during the last scheduled job.
For more information, see Limit scans to only new
content
in Creating and scheduling Sensitive Data Protection inspection
jobs .
Limit scans of files in Cloud Storage to only relevant files
By specifying the
CloudStorageRegexFileSet
message, you can use regular expression filters for finer control over which
files or folders in buckets to include or exclude.
This is useful in situations where you want to skip scanning files that you
know have no sensitive data, such as backups, TMP files, static Web content,
and so on.
Discovery
We recommend the following practices to help you control your data
profiling costs.
Run an estimation
Before you start a data profiling operation, consider running an estimation
first. Running an estimation lets you understand the size and shape of the
BigQuery data to be profiled. Each estimate provides the
approximate table count, data size, and profiling cost. It also shows a
projection of the monthly growth of your BigQuery data.
For more information on running an estimation, see the following:
Estimate data profiling cost for an organization or folder
Estimate data profiling cost for a single project
Add schedules in your scan configurations
To help control the cost of data profiling, consider creating a
schedule where you set
filters and conditions. The following are examples of things you can do:
If you don't need to profile certain tables, you can specify that tables
that match your filters must never be profiled.
If you want to profile only certain tables, you can turn off profiling
for all tables, except for those that match your filter.
If you want certain tables to be profiled only once and never again, you can
specify that those tables must never be reprofiled.
If you don't need to profile old tables, you can set a condition to profile
only the tables that were created after a certain date.
If you don't need to profile tables that are new, you can set a condition to
profile tables only when they reach a certain age or a minimum row count.
View costs using a dashboard and query your audit logs
Create a dashboard to view your billing data so you can make adjustments to your
Sensitive Data Protection usage. Also consider streaming your audit logs to
Sensitive Data Protection so you can analyze usage patterns.
You can export your billing
data to
BigQuery and visualize it in a tool such as
Looker Studio. For a tutorial on creating a billing dashboard, see
Visualize Google Cloud Billing using BigQuery and
Looker Studio .
You can also stream your audit logs to
BigQuery and analyze the logs for usage patterns such as query
costs by user.
Set budget alerts
Set a budget alert to track how your spend is
growing toward a particular amount. Setting a budget does not cap API usage;
it only alerts you when your spend amount gets near the specified amount.
