Blog posts
Get started with Google Cloud's built-in tokenization for sensitive data protection
This blog post explains the use of tokenization as a way to de-identify
sensitive data elements without losing the ability to join or aggregate data
across datasets. This post also introduces the tokenization capabilities of
Sensitive Data Protection.

Automatic data risk management for BigQuery using DLP
The sensitive data discovery service
continuously scans data across your entire organization to give
you general awareness of what data you have and specific visibility into where
sensitive data is stored and processed. This awareness is a critical first step
in protecting and governing your data and acts as a key control to help improve
your security, privacy, and compliance posture.

How tokenization makes data usable without sacrificing privacy
Tokenization, sometimes referred to as pseudonymization or surrogate
replacement, is widely used in industries like finance and healthcare to help
reduce the use of data in use, compliance scope, and minimize sensitive data
being exposed to systems that do not need it. With Sensitive Data Protection,
customers can perform tokenization at scale with minimal setup.

Sensitive Data Protection hybrid inspection for SQL databases using JDBC
This tutorial shows how to use the Sensitive Data Protection
hybrid inspection method with a JDBC driver to
inspect samples of tables in a SQL database like MySQL, SQL Server, or
PostgreSQL running virtually anywhere.

Speech Redaction Framework using Sensitive Data Protection
This tutorial includes a collection of components and code that you can use
to redact sensitive information from audio files. Using files uploaded to
Cloud Storage, it can discover and write sensitive findings or
redact sensitive information from the audio file.
Additionally, a second tutorial, the Speech Analysis Framework includes a
collection of components and code that you can use to transcribe audio, create
a data pipeline for analytics of transcribed audio files, and redact sensitive
information from audio transcripts with Sensitive Data Protection.

Event-driven serverless scheduling architecture with Sensitive Data Protection
This tutorial shows a simple yet effective and scalable event-driven serverless
scheduling architecture with Google Cloud services. The example included
demonstrates how to work with the DLP API to inspect
BigQuery data.

Sensitive Data Protection Filter for Envoy
Sensitive Data Protection Filter for Envoy is a WebAssembly ("Wasm") HTTP filter
for Envoy sidecar proxies inside an Istio service mesh. Sensitive Data Protection
Filter for Envoy captures proxy data plane traffic and sends it for inspection
to Sensitive Data Protection, where the payload is scanned for sensitive data,
including PII.

Envoy
Anomaly detection using streaming analytics & AI
In this post, we walk through a real-time AI pattern for detecting anomalies in
log files. By analyzing and extracting features from network logs, we helped a
telecommunications (telco) customer build a streaming analytics pipeline to
detect anomalies. We also discuss how you can adapt this pattern to meet your
organization's real-time needs. This proof of concept solution uses
Pub/Sub, Dataflow, BigQuery ML, and
Sensitive Data Protection.

De-identification and re-identification of PII in large-scale datasets using Sensitive Data Protection
This solution discusses how to use Sensitive Data Protection to create an automated
data transformation pipeline to de-identify sensitive data like personally
identifiable information (PII). This inspection and migration solution reads
structured and unstructured data from storage systems like Amazon S3 and
Cloud Storage. Data can be automatically de-identified using
DLP API and sent to BigQuery and Cloud Storage.

Relational database import to BigQuery with Dataflow
This proof-of-concept uses Dataflow and Sensitive Data Protection to
securely tokenize and import data from a relational database to
BigQuery. The example describes how to use this pipeline with a
sample SQL Server database created in Google Kubernetes Engine and use of
Sensitive Data Protection template to tokenize PII data before it's persisted.
