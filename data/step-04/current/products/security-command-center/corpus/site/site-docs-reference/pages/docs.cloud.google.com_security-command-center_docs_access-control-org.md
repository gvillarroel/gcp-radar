IAM for organization-level activations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Standard-legacy, Standard, Premium, and Enterprise service tiers
This page describes how to use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to
resources in an organization-level activation of Security Command Center.
This page is relevant to you if either of the following conditions apply:
Security Command Center is activated at the organization level and not at the
project level.
Security Command Center Standard is already activated at the organization level.
Additionally, you have Security Command Center Premium activated on one or more
projects.
If you activated Security Command Center at the project level—and not the
organization level—see IAM for project-level
activations instead.
In an organization-level activation of
Security Command Center, you can control access to resources at different levels of
your resource hierarchy. Security Command Center uses IAM roles to let
you control who can do what with assets, findings, and security sources in your
Security Command Center environment. You grant roles to individuals and applications,
and each role provides specific permissions.
Permissions
Required for activation
To activate Security Command Center, see one of the following based on your service tier:
Activate Security Command Center Standard tier for an organization .
Activate Security Command Center Premium tier for an organization .
Activate the Security Command Center Enterprise tier .
Required for ongoing administration and use
This section describes permissions needed to administer and use Security Command Center Premium and Standard.
For information about Security Command Center Enterprise,
see Configure permissions for ongoing use of Security Command Center Enterprise .
To change the configuration of your organization, you need both of the following roles
at the organization level:
Organization Administrator ( roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin )
Security Center Admin ( roles/securitycenter.admin )
If a user doesn't require edit permissions, consider granting them viewer roles.
To view all assets, findings, and attack paths in Security Command Center, users need the
Security Center Admin Viewer
( roles/securitycenter.adminViewer ) role at the organization level.
To view settings, users need the
Security Center Admin ( roles/securitycenter.admin ) role at the organization level.
To restrict access to individual folders and projects, don't grant all roles at the organization
level. Instead, grant the following roles at the folder or
project level:
Security Center Assets Viewer ( roles/securitycenter.assetsViewer )
Security Center Findings Viewer
( roles/securitycenter.findingsViewer )
Each detection service may require
additional permissions to enable or configure it. See the documentation specific to each service
for more information.
Organization-level roles
When IAM roles are applied at the organization level, projects
and folders under that organization inherit its role bindings .
The following figure illustrates a typical Security Command Center resource hierarchy
with roles granted at the organization level.
Security Command Center resource hierarchy and organization-level roles
(click to enlarge)
IAM roles include permissions to view, edit, update, create, or
delete resources. Roles granted at the organization level in Security Command Center
let you perform prescribed actions on findings, assets, and security sources
throughout your organization. For example, a user granted the
Security Center Findings Editor role ( roles/securitycenter.findingsEditor )
can view or edit findings attached to any resource in any project or folder in
your organization. With this structure, you don't have to grant users roles in
each folder or project.
For instructions on managing roles and permissions, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
Organization-level roles are not suitable for all use cases, particularly for
sensitive applications or compliance standards that require strict access
controls. To create fine-grained access policies, you can grant roles at the
folder and project levels.
Folder-level and project-level roles
Security Command Center lets you grant
Security Command Center IAM roles
for specific folders and projects, creating multiple views, or silos, within
your organization. You grant users and groups different access and edit
permissions to folders and projects across your organization.
The following video describes how to grant folder-level and project-level roles
and how to manage them in the Security Command Center console.
With folder and project roles, users with Security Command Center roles have the
ability to manage assets and findings within designated projects or folders. For
example, a security engineer can be given limited access to select folders and
projects while a security administrator can manage all resources at the
organization level.
Folder and project roles allow Security Command Center permissions to be applied at
lower levels of your organization's resource hierarchy, but do not change the
hierarchy. The following figure illustrates a user with Security Command Center
permissions to access findings in a specific project.
Security Command Center resource hierarchy and project-level
roles - dashed items are inaccessible (click to enlarge)
Users with folder and project roles see a subset of an organization's resources.
Any actions they take are limited to the same scope. For example, if a user has
permissions for a folder, they can access resources in any project in the
folder. Permissions for a project give users access to resources in that
project.
For instructions on managing roles and permissions, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
Role restrictions
By granting Security Command Center roles at the folder or project level,
Security Command Center administrators can do the following:
Limit Security Command Center view or edit permissions to specific folders and
projects
Grant view and edit permissions for groups of assets or findings to specific
users or teams
Restrict the ability to view or edit finding details, including updates
to security marks and finding state, to individuals or groups with access to
the underlying finding
Control access to Security Command Center settings, which can only be viewed by
individuals with organization-level roles
Security Command Center functions
Security Command Center functions are also restricted based on view and edit
permissions.
In the Google Cloud console, Security Command Center lets
individuals without organization-level
permissions choose only resources to which they have access. Their selection
updates all elements of the user interface, including assets, findings, and
settings controls. Users see the privileges attached to their roles and whether
they can access or edit findings at their current scope.
The Security Command Center API and Google Cloud CLI also restrict
functions to prescribed folders and projects. If calls to list or group assets
and findings are made by users granted folder or project roles, only findings or
assets at those scopes are returned.
For organization-level activations of Security Command Center, calls to create or
update findings and finding notifications only support the organization scope.
You need organization-level roles to perform these tasks.
To view the attack paths that are generated by attack path simulations,
the appropriate permissions must be granted at the organization level
and the Google Cloud console view must be set to the organization.
Parent resources for findings
Usually, a finding is attached to a resource, like a virtual machine (VM)
or firewall. Security Command Center attaches findings to the most immediate
container for the resource that generated the finding. For example, if a VM
generates a finding, the finding is attached to the project that contains the
VM. Findings that are not connected to a Google Cloud resource are attached to
the organization and are visible to anyone with organization-level
Security Command Center permissions.
Security Command Center roles
The following IAM roles are available for Security Command Center. You
can grant these roles at the organization, folder, or project level.

Service agent roles
A service agent allows a service to access your resources.
After you activate Security Command Center, the following service agents are created
for you:
service-org- ORGANIZATION_ID @security-center-api.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
This service agent requires the roles/securitycenter.serviceAgent
IAM role.
service-org- ORGANIZATION_ID @gcp-sa-ktd-hpsa.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
This service agent requires the roles/containerthreatdetection.serviceAgent
IAM role.
service-org- ORGANIZATION_ID @gcp-sa-csc-hpsa.iam.gserviceaccount.com (Premium tier only)
This service agent requires the roles/cloudsecuritycompliance.serviceAgent
IAM role.
service-org- ORGANIZATION_ID @gcp-sa-dspm-hpsa.iam.gserviceaccount.com (Premium tier only)
This service agent is used by Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and requires the
roles/dspm.serviceAgent IAM role.
During the activation process
of Security Command Center, you are prompted to grant one or more required
IAM roles to each service agent. Granting
the roles to each service agent is required for Security Command Center to
function.
To view the permissions for each role, see the following:
Security Center Service Agent
Container Threat Detection Service Agent
To grant the roles, you must have the roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin
role.
If you don't have the roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin role,
your organization administrator can grant the roles to the service
agents for you with the following gcloud CLI command:
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding ORGANIZATION_ID \
--member=" SERVICE_AGENT_NAME " \
--role=" IAM_ROLE "
Replace the following:
ORGANIZATION_ID : your organization ID
SERVICE_AGENT_NAME : the name of the service agent
that you are granting the role to. The name is one of the following
service agent names:
service-org- ORGANIZATION_ID @security-center-api.iam.gserviceaccount.com
service-org- ORGANIZATION_ID @gcp-sa-ktd-hpsa.iam.gserviceaccount.com
IAM_ROLE : the following required role that
corresponds to the specified service agent:
roles/securitycenter.serviceAgent
roles/containerthreatdetection.serviceAgent
For more information about IAM roles, see
understanding roles .
