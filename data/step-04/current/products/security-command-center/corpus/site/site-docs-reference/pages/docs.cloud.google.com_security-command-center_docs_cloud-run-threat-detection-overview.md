Cloud Run Threat Detection overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Premium and Enterprise service tiers
Cloud Run Threat Detection is a built-in service of Security Command Center that continuously
monitors the state of supported Cloud Run resources to detect the most
common runtime attacks. If Cloud Run Threat Detection detects an attack, it generates a
finding in Security Command Center in near real-time.
Cloud Run Threat Detection runtime detectors monitor Cloud Run
resources for suspicious binaries and libraries and use natural language
processing (NLP) to detect malicious Bash and Python code.
In addition, control plane detectors are available through
Event Threat Detection .
These detectors monitor the Cloud Logging
stream of your organization or projects to detect potential attacks to the
control plane of your Cloud Run resources.
Supported resources
Cloud Run Threat Detection monitors the following resources:
Cloud Run services
Cloud Run jobs
Supported execution environments
The supported execution environments differ for runtime detectors and
control plane detectors.
Supported execution environments for runtime detectors
Cloud Run Threat Detection runtime detectors support only
Cloud Run resources that run on the second generation execution
environment . Consider the following
before enabling Cloud Run Threat Detection:
When you enable Cloud Run Threat Detection, you can't create a
Cloud Run service or service revision that runs on the first
generation execution environment. The Cloud Run service must
use the second generation execution environment. We recommend that you test
your workloads on the second generation execution environment before enabling
Cloud Run Threat Detection.
To enable runtime threat detection for a service, deploy a
revision that sets the execution environment of
the service to either the second generation or the default execution
environment.
Supported execution environments for control plane detectors
The control plane detectors support both first
and second generation execution environments.
How Cloud Run Threat Detection runtime threat detection works
When you enable Cloud Run Threat Detection, it collects telemetry from the
supported Cloud Run resources to analyze
processes, scripts, and libraries that might indicate a runtime attack. The
following is the execution path when events are detected:
Cloud Run Threat Detection uses a watcher process to collect container and
event information for the complete duration of a Cloud Run
workload.
Cloud Run Threat Detection analyzes the collected event information to determine
whether an event is indicative of an incident. It uses NLP to analyze Bash
and Python scripts for malicious code.
If Cloud Run Threat Detection identifies an incident, it reports the incident as
a finding in Security Command Center.
If Cloud Run Threat Detection doesn't identify an incident, no information is
stored.
All data collected is ephemeral and isn't persistently stored.
For information about how to review Cloud Run Threat Detection findings in the
Google Cloud console, see Review
findings .
Known issues
If the watcher process prematurely stops in a running instance of your
Cloud Run service or job, the watcher process doesn't restart.
The instance stops sending telemetry information to Cloud Run Threat Detection.
Cloud Run Threat Detection logs are absent from the instance logs. There's no
indicator that a watcher process has stopped.
Detectors
This section lists the runtime and control plane detectors that are available.
We regularly add new detectors as new cloud threats emerge.
Runtime detectors
Cloud Run Threat Detection includes the following runtime detectors:
Display name
API name
Description
Command and Control: Steganography Tool Detected
CLOUD_RUN_STEGANOGRAPHY_TOOL_DETECTED
A program identified as a steganography tool was executed, signaling a
potential attempt to conceal communication or data transfer.
Attackers might utilize steganographic techniques to embed malicious
command and control (C2) instructions or exfiltrated data within
seemingly benign digital files, aiming to evade standard security
monitoring and detection. Identifying the use of such tools is crucial
for uncovering hidden malicious activity.
Credential Access: Find Google Cloud Credentials
CLOUD_RUN_FIND_GCP_CREDENTIALS
A command was executed to search for Google Cloud private keys,
passwords, or other sensitive credentials within the container
environment.
An attacker can use stolen Google Cloud credentials to gain
unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources within the targeted
Google Cloud environment.
Credential Access: GPG Key Reconnaissance
CLOUD_RUN_GPG_KEY_RECONNAISSANCE
A command was executed to search for GPG security keys.
An attacker can use stolen GPG security keys to gain unauthorized
access to encrypted communications or files.
Credential Access: Search Private Keys or Passwords
CLOUD_RUN_SEARCH_PRIVATE_KEYS_OR_PASSWORDS
A command was executed to search for private keys, passwords, or other
sensitive credentials within the container environment, indicating a
potential attempt to harvest authentication data.
Attackers often search for credential files to gain unauthorized
access to systems, escalate privileges, or move laterally within the
environment. Detecting such activity is critical to preventing
security breaches.
Defense Evasion: Base64 ELF File Command Line
CLOUD_RUN_BASE64_ELF_FILE_CMDLINE
A process was executed that contains an argument that is an ELF
(Executable and Linkable Format) file.
Detecting an encoded ELF file execution signals that an attacker might
be trying to encode binary data for transfer to ASCII-only command
lines. Attackers can use this technique to evade detection and run
malicious code embedded in an ELF file.
Defense Evasion: Base64 Encoded Python Script Executed
CLOUD_RUN_BASE64_ENCODED_PYTHON_SCRIPT_EXECUTED
A process was executed that contains an argument that is a base64-
encoded python script.
If an encoded python script execution is detected, it's a signal that
an attacker is trying to encode binary data for transfer to ASCII-only
command lines. Attackers can use this technique to evade detection and
run malicious code embedded in a python script.
Defense Evasion: Base64 Encoded Shell Script Executed
CLOUD_RUN_BASE64_ENCODED_SHELL_SCRIPT_EXECUTED
A process was executed that contains an argument that is a base64-
encoded shell script.
If an encoded shell script execution is detected, it's a signal that
an attacker is trying to encode binary data for transfer to ASCII-only
command lines. Attackers can use this technique to evade detection and
run malicious code embedded in a shell script.
Defense Evasion: Launch Code Compiler Tool In Container
CLOUD_RUN_LAUNCH_CODE_COMPILER_TOOL_IN_CONTAINER
A process was initiated to launch a code compiler tool within the
container environment, indicating a potential attempt to build or
modify executable code in an isolated context.
Attackers might use code compilers within containers to develop
malicious payloads, inject code into existing binaries, or create
tools to bypass security controls, all while operating in a less
scrutinized environment to evade detection on the host system.
Execution: Added Malicious Binary Executed
CLOUD_RUN_ADDED_MALICIOUS_BINARY_EXECUTED
A binary that meets the following conditions was executed:
Identified as malicious based on threat intelligence
Not part of the original container image
If an added malicious binary is executed, it's a strong sign that an
attacker has control of the workload and they're executing malicious
software.
Execution: Added Malicious Library Loaded
CLOUD_RUN_ADDED_MALICIOUS_LIBRARY_LOADED
A library that meets the following conditions was loaded:
Identified as malicious based on threat intelligence
Not part of the original container image
If an added malicious library is loaded, it's a strong sign that an
attacker has control of the workload and they're executing malicious
software.
Execution: Built in Malicious Binary Executed
CLOUD_RUN_BUILT_IN_MALICIOUS_BINARY_EXECUTED
A binary that meets the following conditions was executed:
Identified as malicious based on threat intelligence
Included in the original container image
If a built-in malicious binary is executed, it's a sign that the
attacker is deploying malicious containers. They might have gained
control of a legitimate image repository or container build pipeline
and injected a malicious binary into the container image.
Execution: Container Escape
CLOUD_RUN_CONTAINER_ESCAPE
A process was executed within the container that attempted to break
out of the container's isolation, using known escape techniques or
binaries. This type of attack can give the attacker access to
the host system. These processes are identified as potential threats
based on intelligence data.
If a container escape attempt is detected, it might indicate that an
attacker is exploiting vulnerabilities to break out of the container.
As a result, the attacker might gain unauthorized access to the host
system or broader infrastructure, compromising the entire environment.
Execution: Fileless Execution in /memfd:
CLOUD_RUN_FILELESS_EXECUTION_DETECTION_MEMFD
A process was executed using an in-memory file descriptor.
A process launched from an in-memory file might indicate an attacker
is trying to bypass other detection methods to execute malicious code.
Execution: Kubernetes Attack Tool Execution
CLOUD_RUN_KUBERNETES_ATTACK_TOOL_EXECUTION
A Kubernetes-specific attack tool was executed within the environment,
which can indicate that an attacker is targeting Kubernetes cluster
components. These attack tools are identified as potential threats
based on intelligence data.
If an attack tool is executed within the Kubernetes environment, it
can suggest that an attacker has gained access to the cluster and
is using the tool to exploit Kubernetes-specific vulnerabilities or
configurations.
Execution: Local Reconnaissance Tool Execution
CLOUD_RUN_LOCAL_RECONNAISSANCE_TOOL_EXECUTION
A local reconnaissance tool not typically associated with the
container or environment was executed, suggesting an attempt to
gather internal system information. These reconnaissance tools are
identified as potential threats based on intelligence data.
If a reconnaissance tool is executed, it suggests that the attacker
might be trying to map out the infrastructure, identify vulnerabilities,
or collect data on system configurations to plan their next steps.
Execution: Malicious Python executed
CLOUD_RUN_MALICIOUS_PYTHON_EXECUTED
A machine learning model identified the specified Python code as
malicious. Attackers can use Python to transfer tools or other files
from an external system into a compromised environment and execute
commands without binaries.
The detector uses NLP techniques to evaluate the content of executed
Python code. Because this approach isn't based on signatures,
detectors can identify known and novel Python code.
Note: If you enable data residency
for a specific location, then this detector can't be enabled and doesn't
generate findings in that location.
Execution: Modified Malicious Binary Executed
CLOUD_RUN_MODIFIED_MALICIOUS_BINARY_EXECUTED
A binary that meets the following conditions was executed:
Identified as malicious based on threat intelligence
Included in the original container image
Modified from the original container image during the runtime
If a modified malicious binary is executed, it's a strong sign that
an attacker has control of the workload and they're executing
malicious software.
Execution: Modified Malicious Library Loaded
CLOUD_RUN_MODIFIED_MALICIOUS_LIBRARY_LOADED
A library that meets the following conditions was loaded:
Identified as malicious based on threat intelligence
Included in the original container image
Modified from the original container image during the runtime
If a modified malicious library is loaded, it's a strong sign that an
attacker has control of the workload and they're executing malicious
software.
Execution: Netcat Remote Code Execution in Container
CLOUD_RUN_NETCAT_REMOTE_CODE_EXECUTION_IN_CONTAINER
Netcat, a versatile networking utility, was executed within the
container environment, potentially indicating an attempt to establish
unauthorized remote access or exfiltrate data.
The use of Netcat in a containerized environment might signal an
attacker's effort to create a reverse shell, enable lateral movement,
or execute arbitrary commands, which can compromise system
integrity.
Execution: Possible Arbitrary Command Execution through CUPS (CVE-2024-47076)
CLOUD_RUN_POSSIBLE_ARBITRARY_COMMAND_EXECUTION_THROUGH_CUPS
This rule detects the foomatic-rip process executing
common shell programs, which might indicate that an attacker has
exploited CVE-2024-47076. foomatic-rip is part of the
OpenPrinting CUPS, an open source printing service that is a part of
many Linux distributions. Most container images have this printing
service disabled or removed. If this detection occurs, evaluate that
this is intended behavior or disable the service immediately.
Execution: Possible Remote Command Execution Detected
CLOUD_RUN_POSSIBLE_REMOTE_COMMAND_EXECUTION_DETECTED
A process was detected spawning common UNIX commands through a network
socket connection, indicating a potential attempt to establish
unauthorized remote command execution capabilities.
Attackers frequently utilize techniques that mimic reverse shells to
gain interactive control over a compromised system, allowing them to
execute arbitrary commands remotely and bypass standard network
security measures like firewall restrictions. Detecting command
execution over a socket is a strong indicator of malicious remote
access.
Execution: Program Run with Disallowed HTTP Proxy Env
CLOUD_RUN_PROGRAM_RUN_WITH_DISALLOWED_HTTP_PROXY_ENV
A program was executed with an HTTP proxy environment variable that is
disallowed. This can indicate an attempt to bypass security controls,
redirect traffic for malicious purposes, or exfiltrate data through
unauthorized channels.
Attackers might configure disallowed HTTP proxies to intercept sensitive
information, route traffic through malicious servers, or establish
covert communication channels. Detecting the execution of programs
with these environment variables is crucial for maintaining network
security and preventing data breaches.
Execution: Socat Reverse Shell Detected
CLOUD_RUN_SOCAT_REVERSE_SHELL_DETECTED
The socat command has been used to create a reverse shell.
This rule detects the execution socat to create a reverse
shell by redirecting stdin, stdout, and stderr file descriptors. This
is a common technique used by attackers to gain remote access to a
compromised system.
Execution: Suspicious OpenSSL Shared Object Loaded
CLOUD_RUN_SUSPICIOUS_OPENSSL_SHARED_OBJECT_LOADED
OpenSSL has been executed to load a custom shared object.
Attackers might load custom libraries and replace existing libraries
used by OpenSSL in order to run malicious code. Its use in production
is uncommon and should warrant an immediate investigation.
Exfiltration: Launch Remote File Copy Tools in Container
CLOUD_RUN_LAUNCH_REMOTE_FILE_COPY_TOOLS_IN_CONTAINER
A remote file copy tool execution was detected within the container,
indicating potential data exfiltration, lateral movement, or the
deployment of malicious payloads.
Attackers often use these tools to transfer sensitive data outside of
the container, move laterally within the network to compromise other
systems, or introduce malware for further malicious activities.
Detecting the use of remote file copy tools is crucial for preventing
data breaches, unauthorized access, and further compromise of the
container and potentially the host system.
Impact: Detect Malicious Cmdlines
CLOUD_RUN_DETECT_MALICIOUS_CMDLINES
A command was executed with arguments known to be potentially
destructive, such as attempts to delete critical system files or
modify password-related configurations.
Attackers might issue malicious command lines to cause system
instability, prevent recovery by deleting essential files, or gain
unauthorized access by manipulating user credentials. Detecting these
specific command patterns is critical to preventing significant system
impact.
Impact: Remove Bulk Data From Disk
CLOUD_RUN_REMOVE_BULK_DATA_FROM_DISK
A process was detected performing bulk data deletion operations, which
might indicate an attempt to erase evidence, disrupt services, or
execute a data-wiping attack within the container environment.
Attackers might remove large volumes of data to cover their tracks,
sabotage operations, or prepare for ransomware deployment. Detecting
such activity helps in identifying potential threats before critical
data loss occurs.
Impact: Suspicious cryptocurrency mining activity using the Stratum Protocol
CLOUD_RUN_SUSPICIOUS_CRYPTO_MINING_ACTIVITY_USING_STRATUM_PROTOCOL
A process was detected communicating over the Stratum protocol, which
is commonly used by cryptocurrency mining software. This activity
suggests potential unauthorized mining operations within the container
environment.
Attackers often deploy cryptocurrency miners to exploit system
resources for financial gain, leading to degraded performance,
increased operational costs, and potential security risks. Detecting
such activity helps mitigate resource abuse and unauthorized access.
Malicious Script Executed
CLOUD_RUN_MALICIOUS_SCRIPT_EXECUTED
A machine learning model identified the specified Bash code as
malicious. Attackers can use Bash to transfer tools or other files
from an external system into a compromised environment and execute
commands without binaries.
The detector uses NLP techniques to evaluate the content of executed
Bash code. Because this approach isn't based on signatures, detectors
can identify known and novel malicious Bash code.
Note: If you enable data residency
for a specific location, then this detector can't be enabled and doesn't
generate findings in that location.
Malicious URL Observed
CLOUD_RUN_MALICIOUS_URL_OBSERVED
Cloud Run Threat Detection observed a malicious URL in the argument list of
a running process.
The detector checks URLs that are observed in the argument list of
running processes against the lists of unsafe web resources that are
maintained by the Google
Safe Browsing
service. If a URL is incorrectly classified as a phishing site or
malware, report it at
Reporting Incorrect Data .
Privilege Escalation: Abuse of Sudo For Privilege Escalation (CVE-2019-14287)
CLOUD_RUN_ABUSE_SUDO_FOR_PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION
sudo has been executed with arguments that attempt to
elevate privileges.
This rule detects an attempt to exploit CVE-2019-14287, a
vulnerability that allows for privilege escalation by abusing the
sudo command. sudo versions prior to v1.8.28
had an exploit that allowed a non-root user to gain root privileges.
Privilege Escalation: Polkit Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2021-4034)
CLOUD_RUN_POLKIT_LOCAL_PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION_VULNERABILITY
A non-root user has executed pkexec with environment
variables that attempt to escalate privileges.
This rule detects an attempt to exploit a privilege escalation
vulnerability (CVE-2021-4034) in Polkit's pkexec . By
running specially crafted code, a non-root user can use this flaw to
gain root privileges on a compromised system.
Privilege Escalation: Sudo Potential Privilege Escalation (CVE-2021-3156)
CLOUD_RUN_SUDO_POTENTIAL_PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION
A non-root user has executed sudo or sudoedit
with a pattern of arguments that attempt to escalate privileges.
Detects an attempt to exploit a vulnerability affecting
sudo versions 1.9.5p2 and earlier. Executing
sudo or sudoedit with certain arguments,
including one that ends with a single backslash character, as an
unprivileged user can elevate the user's privileges to that of a root
user.
Reverse Shell
CLOUD_RUN_REVERSE_SHELL
A process started with stream redirection to a remote connected
socket. The detector looks for stdin bound to a remote
socket.
With a reverse shell, an attacker can communicate from a compromised
workload to an attacker-controlled machine. The attacker can then
command and control the workload—for example, as part of a
botnet.
Unexpected Child Shell
CLOUD_RUN_UNEXPECTED_CHILD_SHELL
A process that does not normally invoke shells spawned a shell
process.
The detector monitors all process executions. When a shell is
invoked, the detector generates a finding if the parent process is known
to not typically invoke shells.
Control plane detectors
The following control plane detectors are available through Event Threat Detection.
These detectors are enabled by default. You manage these detectors the same way
you do other Event Threat Detection detectors. For more information, see Use
