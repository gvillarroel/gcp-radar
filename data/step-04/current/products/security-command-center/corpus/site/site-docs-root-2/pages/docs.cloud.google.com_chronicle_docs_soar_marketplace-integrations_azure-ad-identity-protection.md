Integrate Microsoft 365 Identity Protection with
Google SecOps
Important: In the Google SecOps platform, the Microsoft 365
Identity Protection integration is called Azure AD Identity Protection .
This document describes how to integrate Microsoft 365 Identity Protection with
Google Security Operations (Google SecOps).
Prerequisites
Before you configure the integration in the Google SecOps
platform, complete the following prerequisite steps:
Create the Microsoft Entra app.
Configure the API permissions for your app.
Create a client secret.
Create Microsoft Entra app
Sign in to the Azure portal as a user
administrator or a password administrator.
Select Microsoft Entra ID .
Go to App registrations > New registration .
Enter the name of the app.
Click Register .
Save the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID values
to use them later when configuring the integration parameters.
Configure API permissions
Go to API Permissions > Add a permission .
Select Microsoft Graph .
In the Select Permissions section, select the following permissions:
IdentityRiskEvent.Read.All
IdentityRiskyUser.ReadWrite.All
Click Add permissions .
Click Grant admin consent for YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME .
When the Grant admin consent confirmation dialog appears, click Yes .
Create client secret
Navigate to Certificates and secrets > New client secret .
Provide a description for a client secret and set its expiration deadline.
Click Add .
Save the value of the client secret (not the secret ID) to use it as the
Client Secret parameter value when configuring the integration. The client
secret value is only displayed once.
Integration parameters
Use the following parameters to configure the integration:

Connectors
To learn more about configuring connectors in Google SecOps,
see Ingest your data (connectors) .
Note: To prevent data loss, connectors utilize Event Flattening . If a raw alert
contains a list of entities (such as multiple email addresses, hostnames, or IP addresses),
connectors automatically flatten them into separate, unique events.
For example, a single raw alert containing three different email addresses is ingested as three
separate events, each containing one distinct email address.
This process ensures that every entity is correctly indexed as a unique asset, making it fully
searchable and actionable in playbooks.
Azure AD Identity Protection - Risk Detections Connector
Pull information about risk detections from Microsoft 365 Identity Protection.
The dynamic list filter works with the riskEventType parameter.
Connector parameters
Use the following parameters to configure the connector:
Parameter Display Name
Type
Default Value
Is Mandatory
Description
Login API Root
String
https://login.microsoftonline.com
No
API root used to authenticate with the Microsoft identity platform.
API Root
String
https://graph.microsoft.com
Yes
API root of the Microsoft 365 Identity Protection instance.
Product Field Name
String
Product Name
Yes
The name of the field where the product name is stored.
The product name primarily impacts mapping. To streamline and improve the mapping process for
the connector, the default value resolves to a fallback value that is referenced
from the code. Any invalid input for this parameter resolves to a fallback
value by default.
The default value is Product Name .
Event Field Name
String
riskEventType
Yes
The name of the field that determines the event name (subtype).
Environment Field Name
String
""
No
The name of the field where the environment name is stored.
If the
environment field is missing, the connector uses the default value.
Environment Regex Pattern
String
.*
No
A regular expression pattern to run on the value found in the
Environment Field Name field. This parameter lets you manipulate
the environment field using the regular expression logic.
Use the default value .* to retrieve the required raw
Environment Field Name value.
If the regular expression pattern is null or empty, or the environment
value is null, the final environment result is the default environment.
PythonProcessTimeout
Integer
180
Yes
The timeout limit, in seconds, for the Python process that runs the
current script.
API Root
String
https://graph.microsoft.com
Yes
API root of the Microsoft 365 Identity Protection instance.
Tenant ID
String
N/A
Yes
Tenant ID of the Microsoft 365 Identity Protection account.
Client ID
String
N/A
Yes
Client ID of the Microsoft 365 Identity Protection account.
Client Secret
Password
N/A
Yes
Client Secret of the Microsoft 365 Identity Protection account.
Lowest Risk Level To Fetch
String
N/A
No
The lowest risk that needs to be used to fetch alerts.
Possible values: Low , Medium , High .
If no value is specified, the connector ingests risk detections with all risk
levels.
Max Hours Backwards
Integer
1
No
The number of hours for which risk detections should be fetched.
Max Alerts To Fetch
Integer
100
No
The number of alerts to process per one connector iteration.
Use whitelist as a blacklist
Checkbox
Unchecked
Yes
If selected, the connector uses the dynamic list as a blocklist.
Verify SSL
Checkbox
Checked
Yes
If selected, the integration validates the SSL certificate when connecting to
the Microsoft 365 Identity Protection server.
Proxy Server Address
String
N/A
No
The address of the proxy server to use.
Proxy Username
String
N/A
No
The proxy username to authenticate with.
