Integrate LevelBlue USM Anywhere with
Google SecOps
This document describes how to integrate LevelBlue Unified Security Management
(USM) Anywhere with Google Security Operations (Google SecOps).
Important: AlienVault USM Anywhere became LevelBlue USM Anywhere. In the
Google SecOps platform, the
integration for LevelBlue USM Anywhere is called AlienVault USM Anywhere .

Connectors
To learn more about configuring connectors in Google SecOps,
see Ingest your data (connectors) .
Note: To prevent data loss, connectors utilize Event Flattening . If a raw alert
contains a list of entities (such as multiple email addresses, hostnames, or IP addresses),
connectors automatically flatten them into separate, unique events.
For example, a single raw alert containing three different email addresses is ingested as three
separate events, each containing one distinct email address.
This process ensures that every entity is correctly indexed as a unique asset, making it fully
searchable and actionable in playbooks.
AlienVault USM Anywhere Connector
Google SecOps fetches alarms from LevelBlue USM Anywhere
in near real-time and forwards them as alerts for cases.
Connector parameters
Use the following parameters to configure the connector:
Parameter name
Type
Default value
Is mandatory
Description

The AlienVault USM Anywhere Connector has two
parameters, allowing smart filtering of the alerts being ingested into
Google SecOps, regarding the suppressed attribute that those
alerts have:
Use Suppressed Filter : This parameter determines whether to filter the
incoming alerts using the Show Suppressed filter or not.
Show Suppressed : This parameter determines whether to include suppressed
alarms in the search or not. There are three options in this connector:
Bring all the AV alerts in, suppressed and not suppressed - clear both
boxes.
Bring only the non-suppressed alarms from AV - select the
Use Suppressed Filter box and clear the Show Suppressed box.
Bring only the suppressed alarms from AV but nothing else - select both
the Use Suppressed Filter and Show Suppressed boxes. It's a default
option.

Suppression Rules from the Alarms
