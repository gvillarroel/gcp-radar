Configure OAuth authentication in Google SecOps
To configure the OAuth authentication for Microsoft Defender for Cloud in
Google SecOps platform, complete the following steps:
Configure the integration parameters and save them.
Generate a refresh token:
Optional: Simulate a case in Google SecOps.
Manually run the Get OAuth Authorization Code action.
Manually run the Generate Token action.
Input the obtained refresh token as the Refresh Token parameter value and
save the configuration.
Configure integration parameters
In Google SecOps, configure the integration parameters
with Client ID, Client secret, Tenant ID, and Subscription ID values that you've
obtained in previous steps.
Generate refresh token
Generating a refresh token requires running manual actions on any existing case.
If your Google Security Operations instance is new and has no existing cases, simulate one.
Simulate case
To simulate a case in Google SecOps, follow these steps:
In the left navigation, select Cases .
On the Cases page, click
add > Simulate Cases .
Select any of the default cases and click Create . It doesn't matter what
case you choose to simulate.
Click Simulate .
If you have an environment other than default and would like to use it,
select the correct environment and click Simulate .
In the Cases tab, click Refresh . The case you have simulated appears
in the case list.
Run the Get OAuth Authorization Code action
Use the Google SecOps case you've simulated or any existing one to run
the Get OAuth Authorization Code action manually.
In the Cases tab, select your simulated case to open a Case View.
Click Manual Action .
In the Manual Action Search field, input Azure Security Center .
In the results under the Azure Security Center integration, select
Get OAuth Authorization Code .
This action returns an authorization link used to interactively sign in to
the Microsoft Entra app.
In the Redirect URL parameter field, input the URL that you've used when
creating the Microsoft Entra app .
Click Execute .
After the action is executed, navigate to the Case Wall of your simulated
case. In the Azure Security Center_Get OAuth Authorization Code action
record, click View More and copy the authorization link.
Open a new browser window in the incognito mode and paste the generated
authorization URL. The Azure sign-in page opens.
Sign in with the user credentials you selected for the integration. After
signing in, your browser should be redirected with a code in the
address bar.
An example of the resulting URL with the code is as follows:
http://localhost/?code=0.ATwAylKP1BpbCEeO0Ou5iiakalBV.......nIAA&state=12345&session_state=28084547-3dea-449a-8b4c-c1671342a39d#
From the URL, copy the access code part that comes after
http://localhost/?code= . You need this access code to run the Get OAuth
Refresh Token action.
Run the Get OAuth Refresh Token action
Use a the Google SecOps case you've simulated to run the
Get OAuth Refresh Token action manually.
In the Cases tab, select your simulated case to open a Case View.
Click Manual Action .
In the Manual Action Search field, type in Azure Security Center .
In the results under the Azure Security Center integration, select
Get OAuth Refresh Token .
In the Authorization Code parameter field, input the access code
that you've obtained after running the Get OAuth Authorization Code action.
Click Execute .
After the action is executed, navigate to the Case Wall of your simulated
case. In the Azure Security Center_Get OAuth Refresh Token action record,
click View More .
Copy the entire value of the generated refresh token.
