Integrate Azure Monitor with Google SecOps
This document explains how to integrate Azure Monitor
with Google Security Operations (Google SecOps).
Use cases
The Azure Monitor integration can address the following use cases:
Log enrichment and context : Use Google SecOps capabilities
to search Azure Monitor logs (such as, Azure Activity or Security Events) during
an incident to retrieve additional context, confirming suspicious activities or
identifying the scope of a breach involving Azure resources.
Investigating Azure authentication events : Use
Google SecOps capabilities to query sign-in logs when a
suspicious IP address or user entity is identified, quickly retrieving all
related authentication attempts and access history from Azure to aid in account
compromise investigations.
Validation of cloud misconfigurations : Use Google SecOps
capabilities to execute specific Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries against the
Azure Activity log to check for recent changes to network security groups,
firewall rules, or key Azure service configurations that may have triggered an
alert.
Before you begin
Before you configure the integration in the Google SecOps
platform, verify that you have the following:
Azure AD Application Registration : An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
application with the necessary permissions (such as, Observability Analytics
Reader) to access log data, from which you must obtain the Client ID and Client
Secret. For detailed steps on setting up this application for API access, see
Access the Azure Monitor Logs API .
Tenant ID : The unique identifier for your Azure Active Directory instance,
which is required to complete the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
Log Analytics Workspace ID : The unique identifier of the specific Azure
Monitor Observability Analytics workspace that the integration queries for
logs. For more information on how to locate the Workspace ID, see
Workspaces .
