BlueLiv
This document describes how to integrate BlueLiv with
Google Security Operations.
Integration guide
The integration purpose is to ingest the threats from BlueLiv, using the
relevant filters to only show the desired threats within
Google Security Operations, using the Threats Connector, and then have additional
actions performed on those threats according to the relevant use cases.
In this quick guide we will go through a few things to make the usage of the
integration easier for Google SecOps customers.
Integration configuration
We will go over the parameters and where to find those so it will be easier for
you to configure the integration:
API Root - this is the URL you are using in order to view the BlueLiv
homepage, when the suffix /api/v2 added to it. For example:
https://tcdach.blueliv.com/api/v2 should be the value on this parameter.
User name - same user name you use to connect to the BlueLiv homepage.
Password - same password you use to connect to the BlueLiv homepage.
Organization ID - you can easily spot the organization ID on the URL you are
using in order to browse the product itself, so for example:
For this example, here the organization ID is 117 :
https://tcdach.blueliv.com/dashboard/organizations/117/indexed
After going through the integration parameters, we can deep dive to the other
terms in our integration.
Module Types
BlueLiv have divided the threats section to module types, and on this
integration we use those types to help the SOAR platform and ingest only the
relevant information if you want to filter by module type. The following module
types are currently available in BlueLiv:
Credentials
Social Media
Credit Cards
Domain Protection
Malware
Data Leakage
Hacktivism
Dark Web
Custom
Media Tracker
Mobile Apps
Note: You can have a number of modules with the same type, for example: Data
Leakage, Siemplify Leakage are the Data Leakage type modules. You can easily
see that by looking at the icon right next to the module name
in the navigation bar.
Threat ID and Module ID
https://tcdach.blueliv.com/dashboard/organizations/117/modules/1303/resource/31024379
Every threat you can find in BlueLiv has a UID, a number that represents it.
This one can also be easily spotted in the URL. A threat is
also called a resource. For example, here the threat UID is 31024379 .
Also, for every module that you have on BlueLiv you have a UID, a number that
represents it. For example, here the threat UID is 1303 .
Recommendation regarding configuration
Blueliv only allows one open session a time. It is recommended to use different
users for integration configuration and connectors for stability purposes. Note:
each connector would need a separate user.
Use Cases
Proactive cyber threat monitoring
Brand Protection
Data Breach Protection
Fraud Prevention
Counterfeit Detection

Connector
BlueLiv - Threats Connector
Description
Pull security threats from BlueLiv. Connector fetches all of the latest threats
from BlueLiv modules.
Whitelist and blacklist filters work with BlueLiv module types. For example, if
you want to get threats only from Hacktivism modules, you can turn on the
whitelist and type in the "Hacktivism" type name.
For each module type, there's a different structure of data being ingested into
Google SecOps. Please modify the mapping in your
Google SecOps instance to best suit your needs. Please make sure to
see the different "event_type" values for each event coming back from BlueLiv.
For the Malware threat type, we currently provide the basic event data only.
We will add an additional event very soon, to better handle the special data
that comes back from a Malware threat type.
Configure BlueLiv - Threats Connector in Google SecOps
For detailed instructions on how to configure a connector in
Google SecOps, see Configuring the
connector .
Connector parameters
Use the following parameters to configure the connector:
Parameter Display Name
Type
