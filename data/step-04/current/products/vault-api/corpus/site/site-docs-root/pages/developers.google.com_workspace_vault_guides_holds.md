Manage holds
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Holds preserve data indefinitely to meet legal or preservation obligations.
Usually, holds are placed on one or more users to ensure that data relevant
to a matter cannot be deleted until that matter is no longer active.
If a user subject to a hold deletes held data, the data is removed from the
user's view, but it is preserved in Google Vault. As long as the hold is in
place, a Vault administrator can search and export that data.
Holds have the following components:
A service. The application responsible for the data to be held. The service can be set to mail, Drive, or Groups.
A scope. The entities covered by the hold. The scope can be set to one or more user accounts, or to an organizational unit (OU).
Additional options (optional). The specific details (search queries or configuration options) used to narrow down the data to be held within the defined scope. Options include:
mail, Groups: search query to narrow down the hold
Drive: include shared drives in the hold
To work with Vault resources, an account must have the
required Vault privileges
and access to the matter. To access a matter, an account must have created the
matter, have the matter shared with them, or have the View All Matters
privilege. A matter must exist before you can
create a hold.
Create a hold for mail on specific user accounts with a search query
The following example shows how a hold named "My First mail Accounts Hold" is created for:
Service: mail
Entity: user accounts "user1" and "user2"
Additional options: search query "to:ceo@company.com"
Retrieve user account IDs from the
Directory API . The HeldAccount can take an
account ID or email. If both are given, the email is used and the account ID is
ignored.
Java
HeldMailQuery mailQuery = new HeldMailQuery (). setTerms ( "to:ceo@company.com" );
List accounts = Lists . newArrayList ();
accounts . add ( new HeldAccount (). setAccountId ( user1accountId ));
accounts . add ( new HeldAccount (). setEmail ( user2Email ));
Hold hold = new Hold ()
. setName ( "My First mail Accounts Hold" )
. setCorpus ( "MAIL" );
. setQuery ( new CorpusQuery (). setMailQuery ( mailQuery ))
. setAccounts ( accounts );
Hold createdHold = client . matters (). holds (). create ( matterId , hold ). execute ();
Python
def create_hold_mail_accounts ( service , matter_id , account_id ):
mail_query = { 'terms' : 'to:ceo@company.com' }
accounts = [
{ 'accountId' : user1_account_id },
{ 'email' : user2_email }
]
wanted_hold = {
'name' : 'My First mail Accounts Hold' ,
'corpus' : 'MAIL' ,
'query' : {
'mailQuery' : mail_query
},
'accounts' : accounts
}
return service . matters () . holds () . create (
matterId = matter_id , body = wanted_hold ) . execute ()
Create a hold for Drive on an OU and include shared drive content
The following example shows how a hold named "My First Drive OU
Hold" is created for the following:
Service: Drive
Entity: org unit "Finance" (OU ID is captured in orgUnitId)
Additional options: include shared drives that users in this org unit are members of
Retrieve organizational unit IDs from the Directory API .
Java
HeldOrgUnit orgUnit = new HeldOrgUnit (). setOrgUnitId ( orgUnitId );
// Include shared drives content.
HeldDriveQuery driveQuery = new HeldDriveQuery (). setIncludeSharedDriveFiles ( true );
// Create the hold.
Hold hold = new Hold ()
. setName ( "My First Drive OU Hold" )
. setCorpus ( "DRIVE" )
. setQuery ( new CorpusQuery (). setDriveQuery ( driveQuery ))
. setOrgUnit ( orgUnit );
Hold createdHold = client . matters (). holds (). create ( matterId , hold ). execute ();
return createdHold ;
Python
def create_hold_drive_org ( service , matter_id , org_unit_id ):
drive_query = { 'includeSharedDriveFiles' : True }
org_unit = { 'orgUnitId' : org_unit_id }
wanted_hold = {
'name' : 'My First Drive OU Hold' ,
'corpus' : 'DRIVE' ,
'orgUnit' : org_unit ,
'query' : {
'driveQuery' : drive_query
}
}
return service . matters () . holds () . create (
matterId = matter_id , body = wanted_hold ) . execute ()
Create a hold for Groups on specific group accounts with a date range
The following example shows how a hold named "My First Group Hold" is created
for the following:
Service: Groups
Entity: group accounts "group1" and "group2"
Additional options: hold only messages with sent dates between "startTime" and "endTime"
Retrieve group account IDs from the
Directory API .
Java
String APRIL_2_2017_GMT = "2017-04-02T00:00:00Z" ; // See below for format*.
List accounts = Lists . newArrayList ();
accounts . add ( new HeldAccount (). setAccountId ( accountId ));
accounts . add ( new HeldAccount (). setAccountId ( accountId2 ));
HeldGroupsQuery groupQuery = new HeldGroupsQuery ();
// Restrict by sent date.
groupQuery . setStartTime ( APRIL_2_2017_GMT );
groupQuery . setEndTime ( APRIL_2_2017_GMT );
// create the hold
Hold hold = new Hold ()
. setName ( "My First Group Hold" )
. setCorpus ( "GROUPS" )
. setQuery ( new CorpusQuery (). setGroupsQuery ( groupQuery ));
hold . setAccounts ( accounts );
Hold createdHold = client . matters (). holds (). create ( matterId , hold ). execute ();
Python
def create_hold_groups_date_range ( service , matter_id , group_account_id ):
groups_query = {
'startTime' : '2017-04-02T00:00:00Z' , # See below for format*
'endTime' : '2017-04-02T00:00:00Z'
}
accounts = [{ 'accountId' : group_account_id }]
wanted_hold = {
'name' : 'My First Group Hold' ,
'corpus' : 'GROUPS' ,
'query' : {
'groupsQuery' : groups_query
},
'accounts' : accounts
}
return service . matters () . holds () . create (
matterId = matter_id , body = wanted_hold ) . execute ()
Timestamp format .
Additionally, start/endTimes are converted to GMT and rounded down to the
start of the given date.
Query and modify existing holds
The following example shows how to list all accounts included in a hold.
Java
client . matters (). holds (). accounts (). list ( matterId , holdId ). execute (). getAccounts ();
Python
# If no accounts are on hold, ['accounts'] will raise an error.
def list_held_accounts ( service , matter_id , hold_id ):
return service . matters () . holds () . accounts () . list (
matterId = matter_id , holdId = hold_id ) . execute ()[ 'accounts' ]
The following example shows how to add and remove an account from a hold.
Java
// Add an account by ID.
client
. matters ()
. holds ()
. accounts ()
. create ( matterId , holdId , new HeldAccount (). setAccountId ( accountId ))
. execute ();
// Remove an account by ID.
client . matters (). holds (). accounts (). delete ( matterId , holdId , accountId ). execute ();
String email = "email@email.com" ;
// Add an account by email.
client
. matters ()
. holds ()
. accounts ()
. create ( matterId , holdId , new HeldAccount (). setEmail ( email ))
. execute ();
Python
def add_held_account ( service , matter_id , hold_id , account_id ):
held_account = { 'accountId' : account_id }
return service . matters () . holds () . accounts () . create (
matterId = matter_id , holdId = hold_id , body = held_account ) . execute ()
def remove_held_account ( service , matter_id , hold_id , account_id ):
return service . matters () . holds () . accounts () . delete (
matterId = matter_id , holdId = hold_id , accountId = account_id ) . execute ()
def add_held_account ( service , matter_id , hold_id , email ):
held_account = { 'email' : email }
return service . matters () . holds () . accounts () . create (
matterId = matter_id , holdId = hold_id , body = held_account ) . execute ()
The following example shows how to modify the organizational unit on an existing
hold.
Java
Hold hold = client . matters (). holds (). get ( matterId , holdId ). execute ();
hold . getOrgUnit (). setOrgUnitId ( newOrgUnitId );
Hold modifiedHold = client . matters (). holds (). update ( matterId , holdId , hold ). execute ();
return modifiedHold ;
Python
def update_hold_ou ( service , matter_id , hold_id , org_unit_id ):
current_hold = get_hold ( matter_id , hold_id )
current_hold [ 'orgUnit' ] = { 'orgUnitId' : org_unit_id }
return service . matters () . holds () . update (
matterId = matter_id , holdId = hold_id , body = current_hold ) . execute ()
The following example shows how to list all holds for a matter.
Java
String matterId = "Matter Id" ;
// List all holds.
List holdsList =
client . matters (). holds (). list ( matterId ). execute (). getHolds ();
// Paginate on holds.
ListHoldsResponse response = client
. matters ()
. holds ()
. list ( matterId )
. setPageSize ( 10 )
. execute ();
String nextPageToken = response . getNextPageToken ();
if ( nextPageToken != null ) {
client
. matters ()
. holds ()
. list ( matterId )
. setPageSize ( 10 )
. setPageToken ( nextPageToken )
. execute ();
}
Python
# This can paginate in the same manner as with matters.
def list_holds ( service , matter_id ):
return service . matters () . holds () . list ( matterId = matter_id ) . execute ()
