Manage matters
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A matter is a container for data related to a specific topic, such as a
litigation case or an investigation. A matter includes the following items:
Saved search queries
Holds
Accounts with which the matter is shared
Export sets
Audit trail
To work with Google Vault resources, an account must have the
required Vault privileges
and access to the matter. To access a matter, an account must have created the
matter, have the matter shared with them, or have the View All Matters
privilege.
A matter has the following states:
State Description
Open The matter is active, and you can create holds, run
searches, and export data within it.
Closed Usually when an investigation is complete, the matter is
closed. Closed matters can be reopened at any time. Before closing a
matter, delete all holds associated with it.
Deleted A matter can be deleted so that it becomes completely
unavailable. A deleted matter remains in Trash for approximately 30 days,
during which time it can be restored. After that period, the matter is
permanently purged. Only closed matters can be deleted.
Create a matter
The following example creates a new matter with a name and description.
Java
Matter matter = new Matter ();
matter . setName ( "Matter Name" );
matter . setDescription ( "Matter Description" );
Matter createdMatter = client . matters (). create ( matter ). execute ();
Python
def create_matter ( service ):
matter_content = {
'name' : 'Matter Name' ,
'description' : 'Matter Description' ,
}
matter = service . matters () . create ( body = matter_content ) . execute ()
return matter
Get a matter
There are two views of a matter: BASIC (default) and FULL . The FULL view
adds matter permissions to the BASIC view.
The following example retrieves the specified matter.
Java
client . matters (). get ( matterId ). execute (); // Returns BASIC view.
client . matters (). get ( matterId ). setView ( "BASIC" ). execute ();
client . matters (). get ( matterId ). setView ( "FULL" ). execute ();
Python
matter_id = getMatterId ()
service . matters () . get ( matterId = matter_id ) . execute (); // Returns BASIC view .
service . matters () . get ( matterId = matter_id , view = 'BASIC' ) . execute ();
service . matters () . get ( matterId = matter_id , view = 'FULL' ) . execute ();
List matters
The following example shows how to list all open, closed, and deleted matters.
By default, the API returns up to 100 matters per request.
Java
List mattersList = client . matters (). list (). execute (). getMatters ();
Python
mattersList = service . matters () . list () . execute ()
The following example shows how to list all open, closed, and deleted matters
over multiple requests.
Java
ListMattersResponse firstPageResponse = client . matters (). list (). setPageSize ( 20 ). execute ();
String nextPageToken = firstPageResponse . getNextPageToken ();
if ( nextPageToken != null ) {
client . matters (). list (). setPageToken ( nextPageToken ). setPageSize ( 20 ). execute ();
}
Python
list_response1 = service . matters () . list (
view = 'FULL' , pageSize = 10 ) . execute ()
for matter in list_response1 [ 'matters' ]:
print ( matter )
if 'nextPageToken' in list_response1 :
list_response2 = service . matters () . list (
pageSize = 10 , pageToken = list_response1 [ 'nextPageToken' ]) . execute ()
for matter in list_response2 [ 'matters' ]:
print ( matter )
The following example shows how to list matters of a specified state.
Java
// Only get open matters.
List openMattersList = client . matters (). list (). setState ( "OPEN" )
. execute (). getMatters ();
// Only get closed matters.
List closedMattersList = client . matters (). list (). setState ( "CLOSED" )
. execute (). getMatters ();
// Only get deleted matters.
List deletedMattersList = client . matters (). list (). setState ( "DELETED" )
. execute (). getMatters ();
Python
# Only get open matters.
openMattersList = client . matters () . list (
state = 'OPEN' ) . execute ()
# Only get closed matters.
closedMattersList = client . matters () . list (
state = 'CLOSED' ) . execute ()
# Only get deleted matters.
deletedMattersList = client . matters () . list (
state = 'DELETED' ) . execute ()
Update a matter
The following example updates the name and description of a matter.
Java
String matterId = "matterId" ;
Matter matter = new Matter (). setName ( "New Name" )
. setDescription ( "New Description" );
client . matters (). update ( matterId , matter ). execute ();
Python
def update_matter ( service , matter_id ):
wanted_matter = {
'name' : 'New Matter Name' ,
'description' : 'New Description'
}
updated_matter = service . matters () . update (
matterId = matter_id , body = wanted_matter ) . execute ()
return updated_matter
Close a matter
The following example shows how to close a matter.
Java
String matterId = "matterId" ;
// If the matter still has holds, this operation will fail.
client . matters (). close ( matterId , new CloseMatterRequest ()). execute ();
Python
def close_matter ( service , matter_id ):
close_response = service . matters () . close (
matterId = matter_id , body = {}) . execute ()
return close_response [ 'matter' ]
Delete, undelete, or reopen a matter
The following example shows how to delete, undelete, or reopen a matter.
Java
Matter matter = client . matters (). get ( matterId ). execute ();
// Delete the matter.
client . matters (). delete ( matter . getMatterId ());
// Undelete the matter.
client . matters (). undelete ( matter . getMatterId (), new UndeleteRequest ());
// Reopen the matter.
client . matters (). reopen ( matter . getMatterId (), new ReopenMatterRequest ());
Python
def reopen_matter ( service , matter_id ):
reopen_response = service . matters () . reopen (
matterId = matter_id , body = {}) . execute ()
return reopen_response [ 'matter' ]
def delete_matter ( service , matter_id ):
service . matters () . delete ( matterId = matter_id ) . execute ()
return get_matter ( matter_id )
def undelete_matter ( service , matter_id ):
undeleted_matter = service . matters () . undelete (
matterId = matter_id , body = {}) . execute ()
return undeleted_matter
Matter permissions
Each matter has a permission set of who can access or edit it. You can view
this by getting the FULL view of a matter.
Java
String matterId = "Matter Id" ;
String accountId = "Account Id" ;
// List permissions for a matter.
Matter matter = client . matters (). get ( matterId ). setView ( "FULL" ). execute ();
List matterPermissions = matter . getMatterPermissions ();
// Add a user to the permission set.
client
. matters ()
. addPermissions ( matterId )
. setMatterPermissionAccountId ( accountId )
. setMatterPermissionRole ( "COLLABORATOR" )
. execute ();
// Remove a user from the permission set.
client
. matters ()
. removePermissions ( matterId )
. setAccountId ( accountId )
. execute ();
Python
def list_matter_permission ( service , matter_id ):
matter = service . matters () . get ( matterId = matter_id , view = 'FULL' ) . execute ()
return matter [ 'matterPermissions' ]
def add_matter_permission ( service , matter_id , account_id ):
permission = service . matters () . addPermissions (
matterId = matter_id ,
matterPermission_accountId = account_id ,
matterPermission_role = 'COLLABORATOR' ,
sendEmails = 'False' ,
ccMe = 'False' ) . execute ()
return permission
def remove_matter_permission ( service , matter_id , account_id ):
service . matters () . removePermissions (
matterId = matter_id , accountId = account_id ) . execute ()
