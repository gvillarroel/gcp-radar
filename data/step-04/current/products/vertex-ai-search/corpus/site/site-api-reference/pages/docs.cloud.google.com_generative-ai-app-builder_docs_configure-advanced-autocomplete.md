Configure advanced autocomplete
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes Vertex AI Search's advanced autocomplete feature.
In the same way as basic autocomplete, advanced autocomplete generates query
suggestions based on the first few characters entered for the query.
Before reading this page, become familiar with Vertex AI Search's
basic autocomplete. See Configure autocomplete .
Key features of advanced autocomplete
The key features of advanced autocomplete that distinguish it from the basic
autocomplete are as follows:
Blended search: Advanced autocomplete can be used with blended search
apps , those are custom search apps that are
connected to more than one data store.
Access control: Advanced autocomplete respects access controls. (Access
controls are also referred to as ACLs, access control lists.) Advanced
autocomplete only suggests search queries that are related to documents that
the searcher has access to. For information about access control, see Use
data source access control .
Language boost: Advanced autocomplete can be set to boost suggestions in one or more
languages. For example, if the browser language is Dutch, autocomplete
suggestions in that language could be boosted. For more information, see
Send an autocomplete request with a language boost .
Recent queries: With advanced autocomplete, instead of regular
autocomplete query suggestions, users can get their recent queries that
prefix-match the letters that they type. For more information, see Send an
autocomplete request and return recent queries .
Before you begin
Before you begin to use advanced autocomplete, do the following:
Review and optionally edit the autocomplete settings for your app. See
Update autocomplete settings .
For smaller data stores, set Enable autocomplete to Now . We recommend
this because small data stores might not contain sufficient data to provide
accurate suggestions.
If your data stores contain any personally identifiable information (PII) or
if you use the search history or user events query suggestions model, review
Protect against PII leaks and set up data loss prevention (DLP)
safeguards that might be needed to prevent leaks of PII.
Send autocomplete requests
The following shows how to send advanced autocomplete requests using the
completionConfig.completeQuery method.
REST
To send an autocomplete request using the API, follow these steps:
Find your app ID. If you already have your app ID, skip to the next step.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the AI Applications page.
Go to Apps
On the Apps page, find the name of your app and get the app's ID from
the ID column.
Call the completionConfig.completeQuery
method.
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/ APP_ID /completionConfig:completeQuery" \
-d '{
"query":" QUERY_STRING "
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project.
APP_ID : the ID of the Vertex AI Search app.
QUERY_STRING : the typeahead input used to fetch
suggestions.
Send an autocomplete request with a language boost
You can boost or bury autocomplete suggestions according to language code, for
example, make autocomplete suggestions in some languages more or less likely to
appear.
The boost value must be between -1 and 1. Setting a negative number "buries"
autocomplete suggestions in that language and a positive number boosts the
language.
Use two-letter language tags defined by BCP 47—for example, en , fr , hi ,
and zh .
REST
To send an autocomplete request that includes a language boost value,
follow these steps:
Find your app ID. If you already have your app ID, skip to the next step.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the AI Applications page.
Go to Apps
On the Apps page, find the name of your app and get the app's ID from
the ID column.
Call the completionConfig.completeQuery
method.
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/ APP_ID /completionConfig:completeQuery" \
-d '{
"query":" QUERY_STRING ",
"boostSpec": {
"conditionBoostSpecs": [{
"condition": "(langCode: ANY( LANG_CODE ))",
"boost": BOOST_VALUE
}]
}
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project.
APP_ID : the ID of the Vertex AI Search app.
QUERY_STRING : the typeahead input used to fetch suggestions.
LANG_CODE : the two-letter code for one or more languages,
in escaped quotes. For example, \"fr\", \"es\" to apply
the boost value to Spanish and French.
BOOST_VALUE : a floating point number between -1 and 1. When
the value is negative, autosuggestions in the language are demoted (they
appear lower down in the list of suggestions). When the value is
positive, suggestions are promoted (they appear higher up in the list).
Example command
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project-123/locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/my-app/completionConfig:completeQuery" \
-d '{
"query": "hol",
"boostSpec": {
"conditionBoostSpecs": [{
"condition": "(langCode: ANY(\"es\", \"fr\"))",
"boost": 0.75 }, {
"condition": "(langCode: ANY(\"en\"))",
"boost": -1
}]
}
}'
In this example, the autocomplete suggestions for the query Co are
boosted (placed higher in the autosuggestion list) if they are in French
or Spanish and buried (placed lower in the autosuggestion list) if
they are in English.
Send an autocomplete request and return recent queries
Return, as suggestions, a list of the user's most recent queries that
prefix-match the query in the request.
The matching query suggestions are listed from the most recent to the oldest. To
use recent search, the user pseudo ID must be provided.
Example
An employee is querying their company intranet site to get information about
taking vacations. The employee has performed the following queries, listed from
most recent to oldest:
PTO , Vacation blackout periods , How much vacation time do I have? , Time
off , Vacation policy , covering a vacant position during absences , and Can I
take unpaid time off? .
Now, in response to the employee typing vac in the search box, the
autocomplete suggestions would be as follows:
Vacation blackout periods
How much vacation time do I have?
Vacation policy
Covering a vacant position during absences
Procedure
To send an autocomplete request that returns the user's most recent queries,
follow these steps:
REST
Find your app ID. If you already have your app ID, skip to the next step.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the AI Applications page.
Go to Apps
On the Apps page, find the name of your app and get the app's ID from
the ID column.
Call the completionConfig.completeQuery
method.
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/ APP_ID /completionConfig:completeQuery" \
-d '{
"query":" QUERY_STRING ",
"suggestionTypes": ["RECENT_SEARCH"],
"userPseudoId": " USER_PSEUDO_ID "
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project.
APP_ID : the ID of the Vertex AI Search app.
QUERY_STRING : the typeahead input used to fetch suggestions.
USER_PSEUDO_ID : a pseudonymized identifier of the user. You
can use an HTTP cookie for this field, which uniquely identifies a
visitor on a single device. Don't set this field to the same identifier
for multiple users. This would combine their query histories. Don't
include personally identifiable information (PII) in this field.
Example command and result
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/my-project-123/locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/my-app/completionConfig:completeQuery" \
-d '{
"query": "hol",
"suggestionTypes": ["RECENT_SEARCH"],
"userPseudoId": "test_user"
}'
{
"recentSearchSuggestions": [
{
"suggestion": "holiday readiness",
"recentSearchTime": "2025-05-19T18:27:07.261698Z"
},
{
"suggestion": "holiday freeze",
"recentSearchTime": "2025-05-19T18:25:45.744021Z"
},
{
"suggestion": "holiday",
"recentSearchTime": "2025-05-19T18:20:08.916884Z"
}
]
}
Note: If you specify suggestionTypes as RECENT_SEARCH , then any
boostSpec , queryModel , or
includeTailSuggestions parameters in your curl
command are ignored.
Use an autocomplete denylist
You can use a denylist to prevent specific terms from appearing as autocomplete
suggestions.
Although advanced autocomplete is at the app-level, denylists are at the
data-store-level. This is significant if your app is a blended search app.
Create a denylist for each data store connected to the app.
For information about creating and using denylists, see Use an autocomplete
denylist .
Use an imported list of autocomplete suggestions
You can choose to provide your own list of autocomplete suggestions instead of
using autocomplete suggestions generated from an autocomplete data model.
For information about how to import a list, see Use an imported list of
autocomplete suggestions .
