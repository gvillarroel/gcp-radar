Check data quality for media recommendations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to find out whether various metrics for your media data meet
their requirement thresholds.
About checking media data quality
Because recent user events are so important for media recommendations, you must
regularly check the quality of your ingested data and user events. You can do
this by reviewing the Optimization tab for your media recommendations app to
determine what improvements you can make to your data in order to optimize for
better quality recommendations.
If a metric's threshold isn't met, then the metric has a warning status.
Then, you need to review the metric and its description to determine what action
you should take to improve your media quality.
All models and objectives need to pass the General quality metric thresholds.
Some model and objectives have additional App-specific quality metrics and
thresholds. The general quality metrics are the same for all apps using the same
data store, but app-specific quality metrics vary according to the app's model
and objectives.
For information about the recommendation models and objectives, see
About media app recommendations types .
Check data quality
Console
To check the quality of your media recommendations data, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the AI Applications page.
AI Applications
Click the name of the media recommendations app that you want check data
quality for.
In the navigation menu, click Data quality and click the
Optimization tab. This page shows the status of various metrics for the
data associated with your app.
Review the General quality and the App-specific quality statuses at
the top of the page. The summary status at the top of the page shows as a
warning if one or more metrics has exceeded its threshold.
The two metrics tables ( General quality and the App-specific
quality ) list the individual metrics.
In the metrics tables, click View details for more information about any metrics in the warning
state.
Optional: If you want to see the threshold for a compliant metric, click
View Details . Thresholds for compliant metrics are not shown in the
metrics table.

This feature is a Preview offering, subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms"
of the GCP Service Specific Terms .
Pre-GA products and features may have limited support, and
changes to pre-GA products and features may not be compatible with other pre-GA
versions. For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Further, by using this feature, you agree to the
Generative AI Preview terms and conditions
("Preview Terms"). For this feature, you can process personal data as outlined in the
Cloud Data Processing Addendum ,
subject to applicable restrictions and obligations in the Agreement (as defined in the Preview Terms).
Use the requirements:checkRequirement method to check the
quality of your media recommendations data, as shown.
To check the quality from the command line, follow these steps:
Find your data store ID. If you already have your data store
ID, skip to the next step.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the AI Applications page and
in the navigation menu, click Data Stores .
Go to the Data Stores page
Click the name of your data store.
On the Data page for your data store, get the data store ID.
Run the following curl command to learn if your media recommendations meets
the thresholds for the general metrics:
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-GFE-SSL: yes" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID " \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/requirements:checkRequirement" \

Review the output:
Look for the value of result :
If the value is SUCCESS , then your data passes the general requirements;
continue to step 4.
If the value is WARNING , continue to step b.
If you don't see result in the output, there are a couple possible reasons:
The PROJECT_ID or DATA_STORE_ID in the request is incorrect.
Some metric values are unavailable. Try again in 6 hours or reach out to a customer engineer for help.
Look for the expression ( requirement.Condition.Expression ): If this
expression evaluates to false, then there is a problem with your data.
Note: The less-than sign in the expression appears in
unicode, \u003c , instead of as "<".
The value of the metrics are in the
requirementCondition.metricResults.value field. The warning threshold
values are in the thresholdBindings.thresholdValues fields. The
description fields can help you understand the purpose of the metric.
For example, the value of doc_with_same_title_percentage is 30.47 and
the warning threshold for doc_with_same_title_percentage_threshold is
1 . There is a data problem that so many of the titles in the data store
are the same, and this needs to be investigated.
If the model and objective combination used for your recommendations app
appears in this table, then you also need to call the check requirement
method, updated with the values for your model and objective:
