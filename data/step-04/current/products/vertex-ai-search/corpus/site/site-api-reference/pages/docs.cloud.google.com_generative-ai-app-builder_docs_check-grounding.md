Check grounding with RAG
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
As part of your
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
experience in Vertex AI Search, you can
check grounding to determine how
grounded a piece of text (called an answer candidate ) is in a given set of
reference texts (called facts ).
The check grounding API returns an overall support score of 0 to 1, which
indicates how much the answer candidate agrees with the given facts. The
response also includes citations to the facts supporting each claim in the
answer candidate.
Perfect grounding requires that every claim in the answer candidate must be
supported by one or more of the given facts. In other words, the claim is
wholly entailed by the facts. If the claim is only partially entailed, it is
not considered grounded. For example, the claim "Google was founded by Larry
Page and Sergey Brin in 1975" is only partially correct—the names of the
founders are correct but the date is wrong—and as such the whole claim is
considered ungrounded. In this version of the check grounding API, a sentence is
considered a single claim.
You can use the check grounding API to check any piece of text. It can be a
human-generated blurb or a machine-generated response. A typical use case is to
check an LLM-generated response against a given set of facts. The check
grounding API is designed to be fast, with latency less than 500ms. This speed
allows chat bots to call the check grounding API during each inference, without
incurring a significant slowdown. The check grounding API can also provide
references to support its findings, so that users can tell which parts of the
generated response are reliable. The API also provides a support score to
indicate the overall accuracy of the response. By setting a citation threshold,
chat bots can filter out responses at inference time that are likely to contain
hallucinated claims.
This page describes how to check grounding using the check grounding API.
Terms defined and explained
Before you use the check grounding API, it helps to understand the inputs and
outputs, and how to structure your grounding facts for best results.
Input data
The check grounding API requires the following inputs in the request.
Answer candidate: An answer candidate can be any piece of text whose
grounding you want to check. For example, in the context of
Vertex AI Search, the answer candidate might be the generated search
summary that answers a query. The API would then determine how grounded the
summary is in the input facts. An answer candidate can have a maximum length
of 4096 tokens, where a token is defined as a word in a sentence or a period
(a punctuation mark used to end the sentence). For example, the sentence
"They wore off-the-rack clothes in 2024." is seven tokens long, including six
words and a period.
Facts: A set of text segments to be used as references for grounding.
A set of metadata attributes (key-value pairs) can be supplied with each
text segment. For example, "Author" and "Title" are typical attribute keys.
The service supports up to 200 facts, each with a maximum of 10k characters.
Google recommends against supplying one very large fact that contains all of
the information. Instead, you can get better results by breaking large facts
into smaller facts and supplying appropriate attributes for the smaller
facts. For example, you can break up a large fact by title, author, or URL,
and supply this information in attributes.
Citation threshold : A float value from 0 to 1 that controls the confidence
for the citations that support the answer candidate. A higher threshold
imposes stricter confidence. Therefore, a higher threshold yields fewer but
stronger citations.
Output data
The check grounding API returns the following for an answer candidate:
Support score: The support score is a number from 0 to 1 that
indicates how grounded an answer candidate is in the provided set of facts.
It loosely approximates the fraction of claims in the answer candidate
that were found to be grounded in one or more of the given facts.
Cited chunks: Cited chunks are portions of the input facts that
support the answer candidate.
Claims and citations: The claims and citations connect a claim (typically
a sentence) of the answer candidate to one or more of the cited chunks that
corroborate the claim.
A claim is demarcated using its start and end positions. These are the byte
positions of the UTF-8 encoded claim string. Note that this is not measured
in characters and, therefore, must be rendered in the user interface keeping
in mind that some characters take more than one byte.
For example, if the claim text contains non-ASCII characters, the start and
end positions vary when measured in characters
(programming-language-dependent) and when measured in bytes
(programming-language-independent).
Claim-level support score: When the claim-level score is enabled, with
each claim, a support score is returned as a number from 0 to 1 that
indicates how grounded the claim is in the provided set of facts. For more
information, see Obtain claim-level
scores for an answer candidate .
Grounding check required : With each claim, a
grounding-check-required boolean is returned. When this returns as False ,
it means that the system deems that the claim doesn't require grounding,
and, therefore, citations aren't returned. For example, a
sentence like "Here is what I found." isn't a fact by itself and, thus,
doesn't require a grounding check.
When the grounding-check-required returns as true , it means that a
grounding check was performed and support scores, citations, if any,
are returned.
Obtain a support score for an answer candidate
To find out how grounded an answer candidate is in a set of facts, follow these
steps:
Prepare your set of facts. For more information and examples, see Terms
defined and explained .
Call the check method using the following code:
REST
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID " \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/groundingConfigs/default_grounding_config:check" \
-d '{
"answerCandidate": " CANDIDATE ",
"facts": [
{
"factText": " TEXT_0 ",
"attributes": {" ATTRIBUTE_A ": " VALUE_A0 "," ATTRIBUTE_B ": " VALUE_B0 "}
},
{
"factText": " TEXT_1 ",
"attributes": {" ATTRIBUTE_A ": " VALUE_A1 "," ATTRIBUTE_B ": " VALUE_B1 "}
},
{
"factText": " TEXT_2 ",
"attributes": {" ATTRIBUTE_A ": " VALUE_A2 "," ATTRIBUTE_B ": " VALUE_B2 "}
}
],
"groundingSpec": {
"citationThreshold": " CITATION_THRESHOLD "
}
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the project number or ID of your
Google Cloud project.
CANDIDATE : the answer candidate string for which
you want to get a support score—for example, Titanic was directed by
James Cameron. It was released in 1997. An answer candidate can have
a maximum length of 4096 tokens, where a token is defined as a word in a
sentence or a period (a punctuation mark used to end the sentence). For
example, the sentence "They wore off-the-rack clothes in 2024." is seven
tokens long, including six words and a period.
TEXT : the text segment to be used
for grounding—for example, Titanic is a 1997 American epic... Academy
Awards. (See the full text in Examples of facts .)
ATTRIBUTE : the name of a metadata
attribute associated with the fact—for example, author or title . This
is a user-defined label to add more information to the fact text. For
example, if the fact text Toronto is the capital of Ontario has an
author attribute with its value as Wikipedia , then the following
claims are considered grounded in the fact:
Wikipedia cites that Toronto is the capital of Ontario
Toronto is the capital of Ontario
However, the claim that Government of Ontario claims that Toronto is
the capital of Ontario is not as grounded as the first two claims.
VALUE : the value for the
attribute—for example, Simple Wikipedia or Titanic (1997 film) .
CITATION_THRESHOLD : a float value from 0 through 1
that determines whether a fact must be cited for a claim in the answer
candidate. A higher threshold leads to fewer but stronger citations
and a lower threshold leads to more but weakier citations. If unset, the
default threshold value is 0.6 .
