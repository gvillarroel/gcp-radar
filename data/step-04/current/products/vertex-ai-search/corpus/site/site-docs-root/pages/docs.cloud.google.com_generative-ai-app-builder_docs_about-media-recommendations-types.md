About media app recommendations types
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes the recommendations types that are available when you
create a media recommendations app ,
including the business objectives, context event types, and other customizations
that are available with each recommendations type.
Recommendations types
The following recommendations types are available with media recommendations
apps:
Others You May Like
Recommended for You
More Like This
Most Popular
Others You May Like
The Others You May Like recommendations type recommends the next document that a
user is most likely to engage with. The recommendation is based on the user's
engagement history and the current context document.
Default optimization objective: click-through rate
Default serving config: N/A
Available customizations:
Business objective
Supported pages for app deployment:
Detail page. For more information, see the view-item and media-play events.
User event requirements:
view-item or media-play for click-through rate objective
media-complete and either media-play or view-item for conversion rate
objective and watch duration per session objective
Recommended for You
The Recommended for You recommendations type predicts the next document that a
user is most likely to engage with based on the engagement history of that user.
This recommendations type is typically used on the home page.
If you use Recommended for You on the home page, select Home Page Context as the
context event type for the app. Home Page Context can deliver better performance
because it uses additional usage signals that are not available with the Generic
option. Only use the Generic option if you don't have view-home-page events.
Default optimization objective: click-through rate
Default context event type: Home page context
Default serving config: N/A
Available customizations:
Business objective
Context event type
Supported pages for app deployment:
All. On category pages, you must provide filter tags.
User event requirements:
view-item or media-play for click-through rate objective. For home page
context, view-home-page is also required.
( media-play or view-item ) and media-complete for conversion rate
objective and watch duration per session objective. For home page context,
view-home-page is also required.
More Like This
The More Like This recommendations type recommends media that is similar to a
context item and is likely to be engaged with next by a viewer of the context
item. More Like This is based on the context item and the aggregate viewing
history of all users who viewed the context item. A More Like This app is
typically used on detail pages or on the home page with a fixed context item.
The More Like This recommendations type uses a variety of factors to determine
how similar two media documents are, including the categories field of the
media documents. For best results, media documents that are similar should have
overlapping categories—for example, ["Action", "Comedy"] categories are
somewhat similar to ["Action", "Thriller"] , but not similar to ["Drama"] .
Default optimization objective: click-through rate
Default serving config: N/A
Available customizations:
Business objective
Supported pages for app deployment:
Detail page
Home page (requires a context item)
User event requirements:
view-item or media-play for click-through rate objective
( media-play or view-item ) and media-complete for conversion rate
objective and watch duration per session objective
Most Popular
The Most Popular recommendations type recommends media that has been most
popular among all users in recent days. The recommendation is based on the
watching or viewing history of all users. You can customize the time window to
check the popularity of the documents.
Default optimization objective: click-through rate
Default serving config: N/A
Available customizations:
Business objective
Time window. Specify the time window in days to check the popularity of
documents in the last X days.
Supported pages for app deployment:
Home page
User event requirements:
view-item or media-play for click-through rate objective
media-complete for conversion rate objective
Limitations:
Most Popular doesn't support customizing serving configs or creating multiple
serving configs
Most Popular doesn't support filtering based on categories
Optimization for business objectives
The machine learning models that underlie media recommendation apps are created
to optimize for a particular business objective, which determines how the model
is built.
After you have trained an app (which is training the underlying model), you
cannot change the optimization objective. You must train a new app to use a
different optimization objective.
Recommendations for Media supports the following optimization objectives.
Click-through rate (CTR)
Optimizing for CTR emphasizes engagement. You should optimize for CTR when you
want to maximize the likelihood that the user interacts with the recommendation.
CTR is the default optimization objective for the Others You May Like
and Recommended for You recommendations types.
Conversion rate (CVR)
Optimizing for conversion rate maximizes the likelihood that the user consumes
the content up to the conversion threshold defined in the app.
The conversion threshold can be specified in seconds or percentage. For example,
if the conversion threshold is set to 25% and the user watches at least 25% of
the program, then the conversion objective is met.
Watch duration per session
Optimizing for watch duration per session maximizes the duration of media
consumption. This objective uses information from clicks, conversions, and watch
duration derived from media-complete user events in order to recommend
items that have a higher probability of being watched longer than others.
When logging user events, make sure that the mediaProgressDuration is
non-negative and is correctly logged in media-complete events in the last 90
days.
The watch duration per session objective is available for Others You May
Like , Recommended for You , and
More Like This recommendation types.
