Create a search app
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create a search app.
Create an app
Console
To create a search app using the Google Cloud console, follow these steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the AI Applications page.
AI Applications
On the Apps page, click add Create app .
On the add Create
app page, under Site search with AI mode , click Create .
Decide if you want Enterprise features for this app and then click the
toggle on or off. Turning on Enterprise edition features is required to get features such as
website search and choosing a region for your app. Enterprise edition
features incur additional cost. For more information, see
Enterprise edition features .
Decide if you want generative responses with advanced LLM features for this
app and then click the
toggle on or off. Activating the Generative Responses option is required
to get features such as search summaries or search with
follow-ups . For more information, see
Generative responses .
In the Your app name field, enter a name for your app.
In the External name of your company or organization field, enter the
common name for your company or organization. Avoid suffixes like Inc or LLC.
This field helps the LLM identify the company that the app represents.
Select a location for your app. Enterprise features must be turned on to
pick a location. Google recommends that you use the default, global
(Global) , unless you have a reason to restrict your data to a particular
geography.
Click Continue .
To connect to a data store, on the Data stores page, select a data store
that you previously created or create a new data store.
Note: If you plan to attach more than one data store to your app, review the
capabilities and limitations of doing so in About blended
search . If you attach only one data store, you can't
attach more later.
Choose one of the following options:
Select an existing data store: If you attach only one data store, you
cannot remove it or add other data stores to the app later. Attaching
multiple data stores lets you update the attached data stores later, but
the app always requires at least two data stores.
Create a new data store and ingest data into it:
Click add Create
data store and follow the steps in the Create a new data store
page.
Choose your new data store and click Select . For more
information, see Create a search data store .
REST
Before you use the command line to create an app, you must have an existing data
store. If you don't have a data store, create one following the steps in
Create a data store and ingest data for Vertex AI Search .
To use the engines.create method to create a search app from
the command line, follow these steps:
Find your data store ID. If you already have your data store
ID, skip to the next step.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the AI Applications page and
in the navigation menu, click Data Stores .
Go to the Data Stores page
Click the name of your data store.
On the Data page for your data store, get the data store ID.
Create a search app and connect it to a data store. A data store
can be attached to only one app and can't be removed from the app later.
Key Term: In Vertex AI Search, the term app can be used
interchangeably with the term engine in the context of APIs.
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID " \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines?engineId= APP_ID " \
-d '{
"displayName": " APP_DISPLAY_NAME ",
"dataStoreIds": [" DATA_STORE_ID "],
"solutionType": "SOLUTION_TYPE_SEARCH",
"industryVertical": "GENERIC",
"searchEngineConfig": {
"searchTier": " SEARCH_TIER ",
"searchAddOns": [" SEARCH_ADD_ON "]
}
}'
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : the ID of your Google Cloud project.
APP_ID : the ID of the Vertex AI Search app that you want to create.
APP_DISPLAY_NAME : the display name of the Vertex AI Search app that you want to create.
DATA_STORE_ID : the ID of an existing Vertex AI Search data store
that you want to add to the Vertex AI Search app.
SEARCH_TIER : the search tier can be
SEARCH_TIER_STANDARD or SEARCH_TIER_ENTERPRISE .
SEARCH_TIER_ENTERPRISE is required to get features such
as website search and choosing a region for your app. Enterprise edition
features incur additional cost. For more information, see Enterprise
edition features .
SEARCH_ADD_ON : if you want generative responses
with advanced LLM features
for this app, then specify SEARCH_ADD_ON_LLM .
Generative responses include
search summaries and
search with follow-ups .
If you don't want generative responses, then either specify
SEARCH_ADD_ON_UNSPECIFIED as the search add-on or remove the
searchAddOns field.
For more information, see
Generative responses .
Note: The
industry vertical
GENERIC is used to create custom search apps that contain
structured, unstructured, website data stores, or multiple data stores
(blended search).
Python
For more information, see the
Vertex AI Search Python API
reference documentation .
To authenticate to Vertex AI Search, set up Application Default Credentials.
