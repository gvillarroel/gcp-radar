This section introduces you to Apigee monetization.
Monetize your APIs using Apigee monetization
As an API provider, you need an easy-to-use and flexible way to monetize your APIs so that you can generate revenue
whenever your APIs are used. Using Apigee's monetization feature, you can add a rate plan to an API product.
The rate plan lets you charge the developers for using your APIs. You can also configure the
rate plan to share your API revenue with the developers.
As an API provider you monetize your APIs by enabling Apigee monetization in your organization and configuring the components defined in the following table.
Component
Description
API proxies
When developing API proxies for use with monetized API products, you can attach the following policies:
VerifyAPIKey policy or the
VerifyAccessToken operation of the OAuth2 policy to determine if an incoming
request is monetizable by checking for the active published rate plan.
For more information, see
Adding an authentication policy .
MonetizationLimitsCheck policy to validate if the developer has purchased the
associated API product and has sufficient balance in the wallet. For more information,
see
Enforcing developer subscriptions to API products .
Quota policy to
use the quota configuration defined using the API product. For more information, see
Enforcing monetization quotas .
DataCapture policy to override monetization-related usage data. For more information,
see
Capture monetization data .
API product
Define the collection of API proxies that you want to provide to app developers as a monetized bundle.
The API product configures the access limits (quotas), API key approval method, rate plan (described below), and other details for the bundled API proxies.
For more information, see What is an API product? and Enforcing monetization quotas in
API products .
Note: If you use the API product with Apigee
monetization, the product name must not contain any trailing spaces.
Rate plan
Define the billing configuration, fees, and charges that are incurred for the use of APIs offered in a
monetized API product bundle.
For example, you can share the API revenue with your developers. For more information,
see Managing rate plans for API products .
Note: If an active rate plan is associated with an API product, the API product is considered to be monetized.
An API product can have multiple rate plans associated with it but
only one rate plan can be active at any point of time.
Manage app developer API product subscriptions
To access an API in a monetized API product, app developers must have a subscription to
the API product and obtain API keys to send with API requests.
App developers can obtain subscriptions through either of the following methods:
Directly, by obtaining a subscription to the API product. In this case, you as an
API provider need to provide a method for app developers to purchase subscriptions
to your API products. Either:
Integrate Apigee monetization with your Drupal-based developer portal
Build a custom portal interface and purchase and manage API products subscriptions using the API
Through a membership in an AppGroup. For information on subscription management using
AppGroups, see
Use AppGroups to manage API product subscriptions .
Use AppGroups to manage API product subscriptions
Apigee supports using AppGroups to manage API product subscriptions and monetization for usage of
those API products. If an app developer is a member of an AppGroup that has a subscription to an
API product, that app developer automatically has the same subscription to the API product.
Note: The email for an AppGroup must be set before purchasing a
subscription for the AppGroup. See
View and manage AppGroups
for information on managing AppGroups.
AppGroups in monetization support the following features:
AppGroups subscribed to API products with rate plans.
AppGroup billing types: PREPAID or POSTPAID .
Prepaid AppGroup wallets debited according to the rate
plan for the subscribed API product.
Top-ups for prepaid AppGroup account balances.
Admin manual adjustment of AppGroup balances.
Consumption and revenue sharing charges reported for AppGroups, similarly to developers.
To use AppGroups with monetization, provide one of the subscription methods listed in
Enable app developers to
purchase API product subscriptions and include AppGroup management in the interface.
For information on general AppGroups management, see
Viewing and managing AppGroups .
Understand monetization quotas
A quota defines the number of requests allowed for an API product over a given time period.
Quotas can protect your backend servers from high traffic variances and differentiate your product line.
When creating your API products , you can configure
business-level quotas to control access to your APIs. For more information about quotas defined at the API product level, see
Quotas .
Attach Quota policies to the API proxies in your monetized API product to ensure that the quota defined at the API product level is used.
For more information, see Enforcing monetization quotas .
Note: If you add a quota after the API product has been in use, the quota calculation starts from the next monetized transaction.
Understand billing for monetized API products
Apigee monetization supports both postpaid and prepaid billing accounts.
Postpaid billing : In postpaid billing, your app developers do not make any upfront payment. App developers are
billed after using your API products.
Apigee does not provide any specific invoice generation functionality for billing. You
handle the billing settlement with your developers.
Prepaid billing : In prepaid billing, app developers pay in advance
before using your API products. The upfront payment made by the developer is
available in the developer's wallet. Based on the usage, the per-transaction cost is
deducted from the wallet.
The setup fee (if any), per-transaction cost, and any recurring fees are deducted from the
wallet. If the developer's wallet contains less than the amount of any setup fee at the time
of the API product purchase attempt, the purchase will fail with an error indicating
insuffient funds.
When creating a rate plan ,
you configure the billing currency and frequency, any setup and recurring fees, and the
consumption-based fees. Based on
the rate plan configuration and the developer's unique API key used to access your APIs, you can
collect usage data for analysis and to generate monetization reports .
Then, you can use the data collected to generate your billing invoices.
