This document explains how to set up programmatic budget and cost anomaly
( Preview )
notifications using
Pub/Sub .
Budgets
and cost anomalies
are typically configured to send email notifications. If you use budgets or
cost anomaly detection as a cost control tool, email notifications might not be
the best method to use to ensure timely action to control your costs.
You can set up and use programmatic notifications to automate cost control
responses. Examples of automated cost control responses include the following:
Integrate with Slack for faster response
Manage resource consumption to reduce costs
Limit spending by disabling billing when you reach your budget
Limitations
Budgets use estimated Cloud Billing data which is subject to
change until your invoice is finalized.
If you set organization policies
to limit resource sharing by domain
(for example, enabling enforceInTransit on Pub/Sub topics),
you might encounter an error when you try to set up or connect Pub/Sub
topics. In this situation, you might need to
force account access
to successfully connect a Pub/Sub topic to a budget. To force
account access, complete the following steps:
Remove the organization policy containing the domain restriction constraint
using one of the following methods:
Temporarily remove the organization policy .
Override the organization policy for the project
that contains the
Pub/Sub topic .
Follow the steps to
connect a Pub/Sub topic .
Reinstate the
organization policy
for the organization or project (optional).
Permissions required for this task
Budget notifications
To set up programmatic budget notifications, you need permissions to create or
modify budgets and Pub/Sub topics. You need a different set of
permissions depending on your level of access.
Users with Cloud Billing account permissions
Users with project-level permissions only

Create a Pub/Sub topic
To set up programmatic budget or anomaly notifications, you must first
create a Pub/Sub topic .
If you already configured a Pub/Sub
topic for budgets or cost anomalies, you can skip this step.
Go to the Google Cloud console Pub/Sub page.
Sign in to Google Cloud console Pub/Sub
Select a project to contain the Pub/Sub topic.
When configuring Pub/Sub topics for billing notifications, we
recommend you use a
FinOps administration project
to contain your billing-related Pub/Sub topics.
Click add_box
Create topic .
In the Topic ID field, provide a topic name.
Retain the default subscription and encryption settings, and click
Create .
Note: You must have permission to grant the Pub/Sub Publisher
role on the topic to allow Cloud Billing to publish messages to it.
Connect your Pub/Sub topic
To enable programmatic notifications to receive Pub/Sub
messages with the current status of your budget or anomaly, you must connect
your budget or anomaly to your Pub/Sub topic.

Delivery guarantees for notifications to Pub/Sub
After you connect your budget or anomaly to a Pub/Sub topic, you
can expect to receive programmatic notifications as follows:
Budget notifications
Budget notifications are sent to the Pub/Sub topic multiple
times per day with the current status of your budget. This cadence is
different than the cadence for budget alert emails, which are only sent
when a budget threshold
is met.
Pub/Sub notifications are sent even if the Cloud Billing
account has no usage.
It may take several hours before you receive the first
Pub/Sub notification.
Pub/Sub only guarantees at-least-once delivery. You might
receive a message multiple times, and messages might arrive out of order.
If delivery fails due to Pub/Sub topic misconfiguration,
you won't be notified.
Delivery might fail for one of the following reasons:
The Pub/Sub topic no longer exists.
The Cloud Billing no longer has permission to publish to the
Pub/Sub topic.
You exceeded your notification quota.
You have organization policies
in place that limit resource sharing by domain .
Anomaly notifications
Anomaly notifications are sent to the Pub/Sub topic only when
the threshold
is reached.
Pub/Sub only guarantees an at-least-once delivery. You might
receive a message multiple times, and messages might arrive out of order.
If delivery fails due to Pub/Sub topic misconfiguration, you
won't be notified.
Delivery might fail for one of the following reasons:
The Pub/Sub topic no longer exists.
The Cloud Billing account no longer has permission to publish to
the Pub/Sub topic.
You exceeded your notification quota.
You have organization policies
in place that limit resource sharing by domain .
