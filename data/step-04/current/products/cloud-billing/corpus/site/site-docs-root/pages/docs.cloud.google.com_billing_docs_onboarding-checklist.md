Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework .
If you're getting started with Google Cloud, you create a self-serve billing
account as part of the Google Cloud setup process .
Overview
This guide is organized into two main sections. The first section provides you
with a conceptual overview of the various resources and roles involved with
managing Google Cloud billing. The second section walks you through the
steps necessary to configure your Google Cloud resources optimized for
your billing needs.
Section 1: Concepts
Resource Overview and Hierarchy: A high-level visual representation of the
various Google Cloud resources that impact your billing
and how they relate to one another.
Roles Overview: A summary of the access roles, organized by resource,
that are directly relevant to your billing set up.
Section 2: Setup Guide
A step-by-step configuration walkthrough covering Google Cloud
onboarding topics relevant to your billing setup, including guidance
for customization based on your organization's needs.
Cloud Billing Concepts
Before working through the setup guide section, familiarize yourself with these
concepts. Understanding the key concepts will help you with configuration
decisions for your cloud environment. If you need additional information, see
the overview of Cloud Billing concepts .
Resource Overview
What is a resource?
In the context of Google Cloud, resource can refer to the service-level
resources that are used to process your workloads (for example, virtual machines)
as well as to the account-level resources that sit above the services, such as
projects, folders, and the organization.
What is resource management?
Resource management is focused on how you should configure and grant access to
the various Google Cloud resources for your company or team, specifically
the setup and organization of the account-level resources that sit above the
service-level resources. Account-level resources are the resources involved in
setting up and administering your Google Cloud account. This document
provides prescriptive advice on configuring your account-level resources and the
roles necessary to manage them to maintain a well-functioning account.
Resource Hierarchy
Google Cloud resources are organized hierarchically. This hierarchy lets
you map your organization's operational structure to Google Cloud, and
to manage access control and permissions for groups of related resources. The
following diagram shows an example resource hierarchy illustrating the core
account-level resources involved in administering your Google Cloud
account.
The public
domain is the mechanism to manage the users in your organization and is
directly related to the organization resource.
The
domain
organization resource represents an entire organization (for example,
a company) and is the top-level node of the hierarchy. The organization
resource provides central visibility and control over all Google Cloud
resources further down in the hierarchy.
Next in the hierarchy are
folder
folders . You can use folders to isolate requirements for different
departments and teams in the parent organization. You can similarly use
folders to separate production resources from development resources.
At the bottom of the hierarchy are
projects . Projects contain the service-level resources (such as
computing, storage, and networking resources) that process your workloads and
constitute your apps.
Resources can be further categorized using
label
labels . You can label the
service-level resources (for example, virtual machines), as well as your
account-level resources (for example, projects).
monetization_on
Cloud Billing accounts are linked to and
pay for projects .
Cloud Billing accounts are connected to a
payment
Google payments profile . The payments profile
is a Google-level resource and you pay for Google services (such as AdWords
and Google Cloud) using the payment methods that are attached to that
profile.
You can enforce granular permissions at different levels in the resource
hierarchy to ensure that the right individuals have the correct access and
permissions within your organization.
The structure you define is flexible and allows you to adapt to evolving
requirements. If you're just beginning your Google Cloud journey, adopt
the simplest structure that satisfies your initial requirements. See the
Resource Manager
overview for full details.
Roles Overview
What are roles?
Roles grant one or more privileges to a user that allow performing a common
business function.
How do roles work in Google Cloud?
Google Cloud offers
Identity and Access Management (IAM) to
manage access control to your Google Cloud resources. IAM
lets you control who (users) has what access (roles) to which
resources by setting IAM policies. To assign permissions to a
user, you use IAM policies to grant specific roles to a user.
Roles have one or more permissions bundled within them, controlling user access
to resources.
You can set an IAM policy (roles) at the
organization level ,
the folder level ,
the project level , or
(in some cases) on the service-level resource. Resources inherit the policies
of the parent node. If you set a policy at the Organization level, it's
inherited by all its child folders and projects. If you set a policy at the
project level, it's inherited by all its child resources.
The diagram below represents the Google Cloud resource hierarchy in
complete form, and calls out the important high-access roles at each level:
public
Domain
The Google Workspace or Cloud Identity super administrators at the domain level are the
first users who can access an organization after creation.
Role: Domain Super Admin
The
Super Admin can grant the Organization Admin role (or any
other role) and recover accounts at the Domain level.
Recommended Assignee
The Super Admin is usually someone who manages accesses at a high
level, like a Domain Administrator.

Google Workspace administrator roles and
Cloud Identity admin roles .
domain
Organization
An
organization (for example, a company) is the root node in the
Google Cloud resource hierarchy. The Organization resource is the
hierarchical ancestor of project resources and Folders. The
IAM access control policies applied on the Organization resource
apply throughout the hierarchy on all resources in the organization.
Role: Organization Admin
The Organization Admin can administer any resource and
grant any role within the Organization.
Recommended Assignee
The Organization Admin is usually someone who manages access
control, like an IT Administrator.
Learn more about
Organization roles .
folder
Folders
Folder resources provide additional grouping mechanisms and isolation
boundaries between projects. They can be seen as
sub-organizations within the Organization. Folders can be used to model
different legal entities, departments, and teams within a company. Folders can
contain sub-folders and projects.
Role: Folder Administrator
The Folder Administrator can create and edit the IAM policy
of folders. They decide how roles are inherited by
projects in the folders.
Recommended Assignee
The Folder Administrator manages finer access control, and is typically a
department head or team manager.
Learn more about
Folder roles .
Projects
The
project resource is the base-level organizing entity.
Organizations and folders may contain multiple projects. A
project is required to use
Google Cloud, and forms the basis for creating, enabling, and using all
Google Cloud services, managing APIs, enabling billing, adding and
removing collaborators, and managing permissions.
Role: Project Creator
The Project Creator role lets you create projects and inherently lets resources
be spun up on Google Cloud and incur usage.
Recommended Assignee
Project Creators in your organization might be
team leads or service accounts (for automation).
Role: Project Owner &
User
The Project Owner & User role lets you to see costs and usage in projects
and label resources.
Recommended Assignee
Project owners and users in your organization might be team leads or developers.

Cloud Billing account
Cloud Billing accounts are linked to and pay for projects.
Cloud Billing accounts are connected to a
Google payments profile .
Role: Billing Account Admin
The Billing Account Admin can enable Billing Export, view cost and spend,
set budgets and alerts, and link or unlink projects.
Recommended Assignee
The Billing Admins in your organization may be someone more finance-minded.
Role: Billing User
Billing Users can link projects to Cloud Billing accounts, but can't
unlink them. The role is usually issued broadly in concert with the Project
Creator role.
Recommended Assignee
Trusted Project Creators in your Organization typically need this role.
Learn more about
Billing roles .
payment
Google payments profile
Google payments profiles are managed outside of your
Google Cloud Organization, in the Google payments center, a single
location where you can manage the ways you pay for all of your Google
products and services, such as Google Ads, Google Cloud, and
Google Fi phone service. Google payments profiles are connected to
Cloud Billing accounts .
Google payments Admin
The payments profile Admin can view and manage payment
methods, make payments, view invoices, and see Google payments accounts.
Recommended Assignee
The Google payments profile Admins in your organization are
typically part of your Finance or Accounting teams.
Learn more about
Google payments profile user permissions .
Setup Guide
Each section in the setup guide provides information about decision points,
offers best-practice recommendations, describes important roles, and provides a
configuration checklist. Information about potential issues is also provided,
with the ultimate goal of helping you configure your Google Cloud
resources optimized for your billing needs. The guidelines help to ensure your
setup is best protected against the most common access and billing issues faced
by Google Cloud customers.
Before you begin
Before working through the setup guide, familiarize yourself with the
Cloud Billing concepts . Understanding the key concepts will
help you with configuration decisions for your cloud environment. Watch the
following video to learn more.
Best Practices: Google Cloud Resource Organization and Access Management (Cloud Next '19)
There are a variety of different ways that you can organize your resources and
set up access controls when using Google Cloud. To ensure your team can
continuously access and manage these resources effectively requires
following some essential best practices. In this session, you'll learn
each of the Google Cloud resources available and receive a best practices
checklist that you can use to prevent you from running into some of the most
common and problematic account configuration issues that customers experience.
The setup guide contains the following sections:
Domain and Organization
Domain (and Identity)
Organizations
Cloud Billing Accounts
Google payments Profiles and Accounts
Projects, Folders, and Labels
Domain and Organization
The Domain and Organization sit at the top of the resource hierarchy. Together,
the Google Cloud Domain and Organization let you centrally administer all
of your users and Google Cloud resources.
The Domain lets you manage the users in your organization.
The Organization lets you manage your Google Cloud resources and
which users have what type of access to those resources.
Domain and Identity
Your company Domain is the primary identity of your organization and
establishes your company's identity with Google services, including
Google Cloud. The Domain is linked to either a Google Workspace or
Cloud Identity account.
Identity is used for authentication and access management of your users to
Google Cloud resources. When first starting out with Google Cloud,
it's important to decide how you want to manage your user authentication and
identity. We offer flexible ways to manage access with Google Workspace and
Cloud Identity.
stars
Key Decision: Cloud Identity and Google Workspace
For user authentication and identity, should you use Cloud Identity or
Google Workspace?
The
Organization resource is closely associated with a
Google Workspace or
Cloud Identity account. You acquire an Organization resource only if
you're also a Google Workspace or Cloud Identity customer. Each
Google Workspace or Cloud Identity account can have exactly one Organization.
Once an Organization resource is created for a domain,
all Google Cloud projects created by members of the account domain
will, by default, belong to the Organization resource.
Google Cloud uses
Google Accounts for authentication and access management. Google
recommends using fully managed corporate Google accounts for increased
visibility, auditing, and control over access to Google Cloud resources.
Cloud Identity
Cloud Identity provides free, managed Google Accounts that you can
use with Google services including Google Cloud. Using Cloud Identity
accounts for each of your users, you can manage all users across your
entire domain from the Google Admin console.
Use case: You don't need Google Workspace features like Drive or
Gmail and only need the account management features offered by
integrating your domain.
Recommend: Obtain an Organization for free by using
Cloud Identity .
Google Workspace
If you're a Google Workspace administrator, you can manage all of your
users and settings through the Google Workspace Admin Console. By
default, all new users are assigned a Google Workspace license. If you have
a subset of developers who don't require Google Workspace licenses, you can
add
Cloud Identity
accounts instead.
Use case: You want to take advantage of Google Workspace features
like Drive or Gmail in addition to the account management features
of Google Workspace.
Recommend: Obtain an Organization by signing up for
Google Workspace .
For more
information, see
Getting an Organization resource and
Setting up Cloud Identity .
Important Roles
public
Domain Super Admin
The
Super Admin can grant the Organization Admin role (or any
other role) and recover accounts at the Domain level.
Recommended Assignee
The Super Admin is usually someone who manages accesses at a high
level, like a Domain Administrator.
Learn more about
Google Workspace administrator roles and
Cloud Identity admin roles .
Checklist
1. Create the Resource
❑
star
Choose Cloud Identity or
Google Workspace .
For Cloud Identity:
Review the
Cloud Identity Overview and get started at the
Cloud Identity Signup page.
Follow the
Signup
Process to manage the Cloud Identity account.
Note: Use your own work email to
begin the signup, but in the last step, use an admin email account
which you can access (for example, admin@yourdomain.com).
Make sure that the admin@yourdomain.com account has an email
address that can receive mail, because Cloud Identity will use
that address to communicate with the Cloud Identity Admin.
Follow the
domain verification process. We also have a
video walkthrough .
For Google Workspace customers, Cloud Identity is included. If you have
non-Google Workspace users in your domain that want to access Google Cloud:
Enable Cloud Identity.
Disable Automatic Google Workspace licensing.
Caution: If, during signup,
you encounter an error message when attempting to use your domain,
visit
the domain troubleshooter .
2. Configure Access
❑
Review the
patterns for adding or synchronizing users and groups .
❑
Add users and groups using the admin
console , via
Google Cloud Directory Sync , or using the
Admin SDK API .
Caution: non-Google Workspace customer using their
@yourdomain.com email as a Google Account to use Docs, Sheets and other
Google Workspace products as consumers will lose access to those services
(even Viewing mode). Please review the article
Add users who have existing Google accounts .
❑
Set up more than one
Super Admin and ensure other project owners, administrators, and
employees know who they are, so they can reach out in case of account access
issues or if there is a need to delegate another Organization Admin.
Warning: At some point, most customers are
affected by loss of access to resources in Google Cloud. Ensure you
are not unintentionally locked out of your Google Cloud resources by
having redundant administrators, multiple Organization Admins, and more
than one Super Admin.
3. Configure the Resource
❑
Check the number of licenses provided. By default, Google provides a
fixed number of free-of-charge licenses . If you need additional
licenses,
contact us .
❑
Cloud Identity provides a diverse set of security and user management
features. For a list of what's included, see the
features and editions comparison chart .
Organizations
An Organization is the root node of the Google Cloud hierarchy of
resources. An Organization is associated with exactly one
Domain . All resources that belong to an Organization
are grouped under the Organization node, which provides insight into and
access control over every resource in the Organization.
stars
Best Practice: Configure an Organization
Google Cloud users aren't required to have an
Organization resource . However, if you need to manage more than one
user account, we strongly recommend
configuring an Organization . The
Organization resource provides many benefits , including:
IAM policy inheritance and
resource access recovery.
For more information, see
Creating and managing Organizations .
Important Roles
domain
Role: Organization Admin
The Organization Admin can administer any resource and
grant any role within the Organization.
Recommended Assignee
The Organization Admin is usually someone who manages access
control, like an IT Administrator.
Learn more about
Organization roles .
Checklist
1. Create the Resource
❑
Obtain an Organization resource . If you followed the steps
for Domain and Identity , you already have
an organization.
2. Configure Access
❑
Set up multiple
Organization Administrators who will be responsible for defining
IAM policies and delegating responsibility for resources
throughout your organization, like Cloud Billing and Project management.
Note: By default, the email account
designated as the Admin in the sign up process for Cloud Identity (usually
admin@yourdomain.com) is assigned as the first Organization
Administrator. If you set up invoiced billing ,
the Technical Contact on the invoiced billing agreement
will be delegated as the Organization Administrator.
❑
Grant IAM roles at the Organization level that you
want everyone to use, while keeping in mind the
security principle of least privilege .
Note: To ensure that
Cloud Billing accounts are only created by users that should handle
payment information, settings, and cost attribution for the organization,
minimize the number of users that are granted the role of Billing Account
Creator. We recommend
removing the Billing Account Creator role from the Organization
level.
3. Configure the Resource
❑
Migrate your Projects and Billing Accounts into your Organization .
Note: For larger-scale migration, we recommend
using the
Organization Setup Wizard . Have an Organization
Admin enumerate all of your projects and billing accounts that need to be
migrated along with a list of their owners for use in the Setup Wizard.
Once migrated, if an owner of a project or billing account loses access to
their account or leaves the company, ownership of the
project or
billing account can be recovered by the Organization Admin.
Cloud Billing Accounts
Billing accounts pay for projects. A project and its service-level resources
are always paid for by a single billing account. A billing account operates
in a single currency and is linked to a
Google payments profile .
A billing account can be linked to one or more projects. Project usage is
tracked and charged to the linked billing account. Projects that are not
linked to a billing account can't use Google Cloud or
Google Maps Platform services. This is true even if you only use
services that are free .
stars
Key Decision: One Billing Account or Multiple Billing Accounts?
We recommend creating one central Cloud Billing
account that lives in your Organization. For most customers, adding
additional billing accounts creates unneeded extra overhead, making them more
difficult to track and manage. And multiple billing accounts might not
behave in the way you expect with
Committed Use Discounts or might cause issues with any promotional
credits.
You may need multiple Cloud Billing accounts if you have any
of these requirements:
You need to split charges for legal or accounting reasons.
You need to pay in multiple currencies.
You need to allocate support costs differently, because support
costs accumulate from across all applicable Billing subaccounts
in the organization and charge only to the parent Billing Account.
stars
Key Decision: Pay with Credit or Debit Card or Use Invoiced Billing?
When you first
set up a Cloud Billing account using the Google Cloud console , by
default, you create a self-serve billing account, connected to a
credit or debit card as the payment instrument.
If you have a dedicated Finance or Accounting team, or if you anticipate a
large amount of spend when you first start on Google Cloud, you might be
better off using
invoiced billing . To learn if your organization is eligible for invoiced
billing,
contact Cloud Billing Support . You must be a billing administrator of
your organization's current billing account to apply.
Important Roles
monetization_on
Role: Billing Account Admin
The Billing Account Admin can:
Manage payment instruments
Enable Billing Export
View costs and spend and set budget alerts
Link and unlink projects
Manage other user roles tied to the Billing Account
Recommended Assignee
This role is typically filled by someone with financial control at your
company, for example, a business lead that owns the P&L or a technical
team member with budget management responsibility.
Importantly, because this role is required to contact
Billing Support, you shouldn't use a service account or mailing list
as a billing administrator.
monetization_on
Role: Billing User
Billing Users can:
Link projects to billing accounts, but can't unlink them
View costs
Recommended Assignee
This role is usually issued broadly in concert with the Project Creator role.
Trusted Project Creators in your organization typically need this role so
they can link their projects to a billing account.
Learn more about
Billing roles .
Note: Want to control who can view costs?
Different roles applied at different levels contain permissions that allow
access to view costs.
For example, if you want a user to be able to view
costs for an entire billing account, including all of its projects, set the
billing.accounts.getSpendingInformation permission on the billing
account level. The following predefined roles grant this permission by
default: Billing Account Administrator, Billing Account Costs
Manager, and Billing Account Viewer.
If you want to limit a user to viewing only the costs for a specific
project , give the user the billing.resourceCosts.get
permission on the project. The following predefined roles grant this
permission by default: Project Owner, Project Editor, and
Project Viewer.
For more information, see
Overview of billing access control and
Custom roles for billing .
Checklist
1. Create the Resource
❑
star
Create
or Identify your main Billing Account that you want to use. If you have
an invoiced account , this step
is already done for you.
2. Configure Access
❑
Grant access to view Billing Reports to people in finance and other
departments and roles where users need to track spend or need to review cost
anomalies.
❑
Assign multiple
Billing Account Administrators to each Billing Account – you
might also consider using Organization-level permissions.
Note: The Billing Account Administrator is an
owner role for a billing account, and can be set at the Billing Account or
at the Organization level. Billing Account Administrators can manage payment
instruments, configure billing exports, view cost information, link and
unlink projects and manage other user roles on the billing account.
3. Configure the Resource
❑
star
Consolidate multiple Billing Accounts into your main Billing Accounts.
First identify your main Billing Accounts and the projects you want to
link to those billing accounts. Learn how to
view projects linked to a
billing account .
Link or move existing projects onto your main Billing Accounts .
Note: If you have many projects to move,
try our gcloud tool to
link projects to a billing account .
❑
star
Settle and close any other billing accounts that you no longer intend to
use to avoid potential issues in the future.
View your old Billing Accounts to verify that they no longer have any
linked projects.
After moving all your projects onto your main Billing Accounts,
wait two days for the charges to stop on your old Billing Accounts.
After two days, settle any existing balances on the old billing
accounts, and then
close the old Billing Accounts .
❑
attach_money
Review the
recommended next steps
after you create a Cloud Billing account.
Create a FinOps administration project
to use for billing APIs and project-dependent billing tools.
❑
attach_money
Set up budget alerts
with multiple alert thresholds to reduce spending surprises and
unexpected cost overruns.
❑
attach_money
Set up automatic exports of billing data to use for monitoring and
analyzing costs. Learn how to
export billing data to BigQuery .
Note: Data is available in your dataset only
from the time export is enabled. For cost management purposes, we
recommend enabling Billing Export on your Billing Accounts
early on, when you're just beginning to attach Projects to
Billing Accounts. This way, your usage data will be tracked and available
to you from day one, and ready for analysis using a variety of tools.
stars
Key Concepts: Billing Export, Billing Reports, and Invoices
Your usage is reported from your Projects to your Billing Accounts and
your usage data is made available to you in a variety of ways, all of which
can be used to help you understand the full picture of your spend.
Your invoice tells you what you owe.
Billing reports tell you why and where your costs came from.
To answer cost questions, we recommend looking at billing reports
first.
Billing Export outputs your daily usage estimates to a dataset or
file you specify. You can use it to run analysis on your usage data.
Billing Export to BigQuery includes an invoice.month
field so you can match your exported data to your invoices.
Late-reported usage might cause your data to not map
directly to your invoice; that is, some product usage at the very end of
a month may be charged to the next month's invoice.
Exported billing data doesn't include any tax accrued or
credits issued to a billing account.
You can use Looker Studio to
visualize your spend over time .
Billing Reports uses the same data that Billing Export uses, and
displays an interactive chart that plots usage costs for all projects
linked to a billing account. Use
billing reports to get an at-a-glance overview of your usage costs and
discover and analyze trends.
You
access billing reports in the Google Cloud console.
If you have multiple billing accounts, the billing report displays
usage costs for one billing account at a time, not aggregated across
all billing accounts.
Depending on your level of access, your view of usage costs may be
limited to viewing the costs of certain projects, rather than all of
the projects linked to a billing account.
Invoices represent the canonical amount you're billed for each
month and provide an exact breakdown of what usage you were billed for.
Review your invoice PDF or CSV line items each month and review the
Google payments center for
credit memos and invoice payments history.
Caution : As of November 2019, the CSV invoice is
deprecated and replaced by the
Cost Table report. If your organization currently processes the invoice or
statement CSV,
download the Cost Table to CSV and process it in place of the
invoice or statement CSV.
Google payments Profiles and Accounts
Your business is represented by a
Google payments profile , and you pay for Google services using the
payment methods that are attached to that profile. The payments
profile is a Google-level resource managed at
payments.google.com
and is linked to a
Cloud Billing account .
warning
Warning: The payments profile isn't a
Google Cloud resource. A payments profile is a
Google-level resource that is managed outside of your Google Cloud
organization, requiring
separate roles and permissions . Although some
payments-related permissions are "acquired" with the
Billing Account Administrator IAM role (for example, to view
payment details, update payment methods, and make a manual payment), you
need separate payments-specific user permissions to
fully manage Google payments profiles and payments
accounts. For Google payments profiles, you can
add and remove users or change permissions in the Google payments center.
stars
Key Decision: Use One or Multiple Google payments profiles?
Similar to Cloud Billing accounts, for administrative
purposes, fewer payments profiles are generally
recommended. For most customers, creating additional
payments profiles adds more overhead and exposure to potential
issues.
You might want to
create multiple payments profiles if:
You want separate personal and business payments
profiles tied to your Google Account.
You want to manage payments profiles for more than one
business or organization.
You want payments profiles in multiple countries.
You might have to create a new profile when changing countries.
Your Cloud Billing accounts need to be linked to an appropriate
Google payments profile.
Important Roles

Caution: Your Google payments profile
contains important billing information but it's administered outside of
your Organization hierarchy. Ensure its information is regularly reviewed
and up to date by setting up more than one payments profile
Admin who handles this information. We recommend tasking an
administrator to make regular reviews of your payments
profile's information.
Checklist
1. Create the Resource
❑
star
Create a Business type payments profile
for use with Google Cloud. If an invoiced Cloud Billing
account was created for you, this step is already done for you. If you're
setting up a Cloud Billing account online, you'll create (or
select) a Google payments profile as part of the billing-account-creation
process.
Note: When creating a Cloud Billing
account, you're given the option to select an existing Google payments
account or to create a new payments profile. To simplify
the management of your Cloud Billing account, whenever possible,
we recommend
reusing an existing business payments profile
instead of creating a new Google payments profile.
2. Configure Access
❑
Assign more than one
Google payments profile Admin to be in charge of editing information
like addresses, payment methods, tax information, and other account
settings.
Caution: Any permissions related to a
Google payments profile apply to all of the products
associated with that profile. Whoever has these permissions should:
Have the authority to view or edit information that can affect other
products in that Google payments profile (for example, products other
than Google Cloud might include Google Adwords);
Be aware of this scope of access when reviewing invoices or account
alerts to ensure they apply to the correct product (for example, an
account alert might be triggered by Google Adwords but doesn't apply to
Google Cloud).
Note: To ensure users can receive
monthly invoices and important communications about Google payments
profile issues,
new Google payments profile users and administrators will need to
verify their email address.
❑
For invoiced billing, assign multiple
invoice delivery addresses , both for email delivery and for paper invoice
delivery, to ensure that you're always aware of when a new invoice has been
sent out.
❑
For electronic notifications and monthly statements,
add users and set their
email preferences to receive documents and notices.
3. Configure the Resource
❑
Regularly review the information on your Google payments profile to
ensure it's up to date, especially physical and email addresses,
payments users, and payment instruments.
Warning: Out-of-date information can lead to
missed notifications, lost access, or missed payments.
❑
If not on invoiced billing:
payment
Add a backup payment method as a safety net, in case the primary method
is declined.
Regularly review your
cost and payment history .
❑
For invoiced billing:
Each month,
review your invoice carefully, and look for anomalies and
unexpected changes.
Regularly check for any unapplied credits and payments to ensure that
your monthly payments and credits are correctly applied to your
invoices. For help, reach out to our collections team to
apply any unmatched credits you might have.
Projects, Folders, and Labels
Projects, folders, and labels help you create logical groupings of resources
that support your management and cost attribution requirements.
Overview
Projects are:
Required to use resources (such as Compute Engine virtual machines,
Pub/Sub topics, and Cloud Storage buckets)
The base-level organizing entity in Google Cloud – all
service-level resources are parented by projects
Used to form the basis for enabling services, APIs, and IAM
permissions
Folders are:
A grouping mechanism for projects and can contain both projects and other
folders
Used to group resources that share common IAM policies
Mapped under an Organization node (you must have an Organization node
to use folders)
Labels are:
Used to categorize your Google Cloud resources (such as Compute Engine
instances)
Key-value pairs you attach to resources, letting you filter resources
based on their labels
Great for cost tracking at a granular-level because they're forwarded to the
billing system so you can analyze your charges by label
stars
Key Decision: Folders and Projects Strategy
Projects are required. Folders are optional, but recommended.
Why use projects? Projects are the basic organizing entity in Google Cloud.
Projects are required to use service-level resources, such as
Compute Engine and Cloud Storage. Service-level resources inherit
project settings and permissions. You might need to create multiple
projects, depending on the number of products or services you're running
on Google Cloud. You'll want to define a meaningful naming strategy for
your projects so you can easily identify them. For more details about projects,
see
Creating and managing projects .
Why use folders? Folders group projects, centrally applying
consistent policies and permissions across them. You might want to group your
resources together logically using folders, depending on the number of people
and teams you have who will be using Google Cloud, and the number of
products and services you'll be running on Google Cloud. For example,
you could set up separate folders for development, staging, and production
projects for a service. Or, you might choose to spread the projects and
services across folders that reflect different environments. You could use
folders to organize your projects by departments within your company. One
benefit of using folders is you can enforce different IAM
policies on each folder. For more details about using folders, see
Creating and managing folders .
Why use labels? Labels annotate resources within and across projects.
Depending on your cost tracking requirements, you might want to apply labels
to resources to identify them by what they are, what they do, or what team
they're related to. For example, you might label all of your Compute Engine
instances that are HTTP servers, or label all of the components that are
related to your database service. For more details about using labels, see
Creating and Managing Labels .
Important Roles
Role: Project Creator
The Project Creator role lets you create
Projects and inherently lets resources
be spun up on Google Cloud and incur usage.
Recommended Assignee
Project Creators in your organization might be
team leads or service accounts (for automation).
Role: Project Owner and
User
The Project Owner and
User role lets you see costs and usage in a project and label resources.
Recommended Assignee
Project owners and users in your organization might be team leads or developers.
Learn more about
Project roles .
folder
Role: Folder Administrator
The Folder Administrator can create and edit the IAM policy
of folders. They decide how roles are inherited by Projects in the
folders.
Recommended Assignee
The Folder Administrator manages finer access control, and is typically a
department head or team manager.
Learn more about
Folder roles .
Note: Want to control who can view costs?
Different roles applied at different levels contain permissions that allow
access to view costs.
For example, if you want a user to be able to view
costs for an entire billing account, including all of its projects, set the
billing.accounts.getSpendingInformation permission on the billing
account level. The following predefined roles grant this permission by
default: Billing Account Administrator, Billing Account Costs
Manager, and Billing Account Viewer.
If you want to limit a user to viewing only the costs for a specific
project , give the user the billing.resourceCosts.get
permission on the project. The following predefined roles grant this
permission by default: Project Owner, Project Editor, and
Project Viewer.
For more information, see
Overview of billing access control and
Custom roles for billing .
Checklist
1. Create the Resource
❑
star
Create Projects to group resources together that share a common
goal, theme, or purpose. If a product or service needs to use multiple
Google Cloud resources, like Compute and Storage, use Projects to group
them together.
Note: Project Creators in your organization should be
assigned the Billing Account User role on your Organization's Billing
Account so that they can link projects to a Billing Account.
All active Projects should have a linked Billing Account.
❑
star
Name Projects meaningfully . Decide on a strategy for naming
your projects. For example, you could name your project to reflect the service
and the collection of resources it contains, such as productname-prod .
The project name is a human-readable way to identify your projects. The
project ID is generated from the project name you enter when you create the
project in the Google Cloud Console.
❑
Set up folders to mirror the way you work in your organization
and on your infrastructure.
2. Configure Access
❑
Use Folders to specify IAM permissions for teams,
products, services, or environments.
❑
Set project-level IAM permissions as needed (if you aren't
using folders or need another level of granularity).
3. Configure the Resource
❑
star
Place a lien on critical projects . To prevent projects from being
accidentally deleted, add protections against project deletion with liens.
You can place a lien upon a project to block the project's deletion until
you remove the lien. This can be useful to protect important projects.
❑
attach_money
Use Labels
to further categorize your resources. You can use labels to tag resources
cross-Project and cross-Folder. Each resource can be tagged with multiple
labels. Information about labels is forwarded to the billing system and
picked up in Billing Export so
they're useful in cost reporting and analysis.
attach_money
Note: Labels and Project Names are key in cost management. The names
propagate to Billing Export and can be used to answer questions like
"How much am I spending on databases?" and "What projects are costing me
the most this month?"
❑
Decide whether or not you'll be purchasing
Committed Use Discounts (CUDs) for your Projects and understand how
Sustained Use Discounts (SUDs) apply to your Compute Engine resources
and bills.
❑
If needed, review how quotas work and
request
a quota adjustment .
❑
If needed,
enable APIs for your projects .
Enabling
an API associates it with the current project, adds monitoring pages,
and enables billing for that API if billing is enabled for the project.
