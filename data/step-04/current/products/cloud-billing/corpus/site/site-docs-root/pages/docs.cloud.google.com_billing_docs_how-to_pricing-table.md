View and download prices for Google's cloud services
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Pricing page provides Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) prices for Google's cloud
services, including Google Cloud and Google Maps Platform.
Note : This document discusses some spend-based committed use discounts (CUDs) that
automatically migrate to a new consumption model, which leverages discounts rather than credits.
The migration date is indicated by a notification in the Google Cloud console Billing Overview
page. For more information about the improvements, the affected CUDs, and any required actions on
your part, see Spend-based CUDs .
The list prices displayed
in the table are current as of the date you're viewing the report. List prices
are subject to change in accordance with
the Google Cloud terms of service .
The data displayed in your report is dependent on your
level of access
to your Cloud Billing account:
Full features of the pricing report include the following:
Option to choose between two views for the pricing table. Each view displays
SKUs and prices specific to the selected Cloud Billing account:
A list displaying SKU prices only for the SKUs that have incurred usage.
A list displaying prices for all Google Cloud and
Google Maps Platform services SKUs.
If your Cloud Billing account has custom contract pricing,
each SKU displays the list price, your contract price, and your effective
discount.
Additional pricing report features available to all levels of access:
If a SKU is subject to
tiered pricing ,
each pricing tier for a SKU is listed as a separate row.
The list price shown is the current price as of the date the report is
viewed.
All the prices are shown in the currency of the selected billing account.
The report view is customizable and downloadable to CSV for offline
analysis.
You can also get your Cloud Billing account pricing data in these ways:

Only one view is available, a view that displays the entire public catalog
of SKUs and list prices for Google Cloud and
Google Maps Platform, whether or not your account has incurred
usage for the SKUs.
For more information about billing permissions, see:
Overview of Cloud Billing access control
Create custom roles for Cloud Billing
Understanding predefined IAM roles for Cloud Billing
Access the report
To view the Pricing report for your Cloud Billing account:
In the Google Cloud console, sign in to the Pricing page for your
Cloud Billing account.
Sign in to your Cloud Billing account
At the prompt, choose the Cloud Billing account
for which you'd like to view the Pricing page.
If you have
sufficient permissions
to access the full features of the report, the Pricing page opens and
displays a tabular view of the prices for the SKUs with historical usage ,
along with any custom contract prices if applicable to your
Cloud Billing account.
If you have
permissions providing limited access ,
the Pricing page opens and displays a tabular view of the entire
publicly available catalog of SKUs and list prices for
Google Cloud and Google Maps Platform.
Note: In the Google Cloud console, when you're accessing a subaccount
Cloud Billing account, if you're assigned
permissions providing limited access
to the pricing page, in the console navigation you will not see an icon or
link to the Pricing page. However, you can still access the report using a
direct link to the Pricing page in the Google Cloud console .
How to read the pricing table
The pricing table shows you the prices for Google Cloud and
Google Maps Platform services SKUs.
Each row displays the list price for a SKU or
SKU tier .
If the Cloud Billing account is associated with a custom pricing
contract, the row also includes the contract price and the effective discount.
The contract prices and SKUs are only displayed on the report if you have
sufficient permissions
on the Cloud Billing account.
The SKU pricing information doesn't include credits (such as
promotions, sustained use discounts, committed use discounts, or spending
based discounts) or the cost of support.
Figure 1 : Example of the pricing table showing list
prices for SKUs with historical usage.
For Cloud Billing accounts with a custom pricing contract, the
effective discount percentage is computed using this
equation:
Effective discount = (List price - Contract price) / List price ×
100
Figure 2 : Example of the pricing table showing prices for
SKUs with historical usage, for a Cloud Billing account with a
custom pricing contract.
Customize the display of the pricing table
If you have
sufficient permissions
to access the full features of the report, then by default, when you first
access the pricing table, you see a tabular view of the prices for SKUs with
historical usage , with a set of pre-selected columns of data.
If you have
permissions providing limited access ,
then by default, when you first access the pricing table, you see a
tabular view of the entire publicly-available list of SKUs and list prices for
Google Cloud and Google Maps Platform.
To customize your pricing table, do any of the following:
Choose your table view:
Table view options are available when viewing the Pricing page with
full permissions .
If you're viewing the report using
limited permissions
(such as a Billing Account Costs Manager or a Billing Account User ),
you can't choose a table view option.
Select one of the following options:
View SKUs with historical usage : For the selected Cloud Billing
account, displays SKUs and prices only for the SKUs that have incurred
usage.
View all SKUs : For the selected Cloud Billing account, displays
SKUs and prices for all Google Cloud and Google Maps Platform services
SKUs.
Set one or many filters: Select
filter_list
Filter table to create filters by column value (for example,
Service description: Compute Engine ). By default, the filter properties
are connected by AND logic. To search on multiple terms using OR logic,
add an OR operator between the filter properties.
Select the columns to display: You can select or deselect the columns to
show in the table using the Column display options
( view_column ). This
setting also controls which columns download to CSV.
Note: Depending on the width of your screen and the number of columns you're
displaying, you might need to scroll your online view of the report right and
left to view all the columns.
Change the sort order of the data : Click a column header to sort the
data in the table by that column. You can toggle the sort between descending
( arrow_downward ) and
ascending
( arrow_upward ) order.
Pricing table fields for consumption models
There are new fields in the Pricing table, for
example Consumption model description :
By using the column chooser on the right side of the table, you have granular
control over your pricing report. This lets you create a view tailored to
your specific needs, whether that's a high-level overview focusing on product
names or a detailed deep-dive that includes specific IDs and taxonomy.
You can choose the data points to show, for example:
Identifiers : SKU ID for technical analysis.
Descriptions : SKU description and Consumption model description for
better readability.
Classification : Product taxonomy to understand how a SKU is
categorized within the Google Cloud ecosystem.
Pricing Details : Price reason to understand why a certain price is
being applied (e.g., DEFAULT_PRICE ).
Download the pricing table to CSV
You can download the pricing data to a comma-separated values (CSV) file using
the download button
( get_app ) at the top of
the table.
Notes about the data downloaded to CSV:
The table view option
you set allows you to customize both your online tabular view and
which rows are downloaded. For example, if you select view SKUs with
historical usage , when you download to CSV, only the SKUs that match that
setting are downloaded, instead of the full catalog list of SKUs.
The filters
( filter_list ) you set
only customize your online tabular view, affecting the rows that are
displayed. When you download to CSV, your selected filters aren't used and
all rows are downloaded.
The column selector
( view_column ) lets you
customize both your online tabular view and which fields are
downloaded. When you download to CSV, only the columns you specify are
downloaded.
Columns in the pricing table
The following values are presented on the Pricing table (if applicable to
your Cloud Billing account and your
level of account access ).
The CSV report is a flat file, without any filtering, and only downloads the
columns you selected to view (using the column selector:
view_column ).

(if any).
For example, a single SKU might be split into two or more SKUs. When this
occurs, this is the list of destination SKU names.
Aggregation level
The level at which usage is aggregated to compute cost for
pricing tiers .
Levels include:
ACCOUNT : Indicates that usage for tiered pricing is

aggregated per project.
UNKNOWN_AGGREGATION_LEVEL : Default value for non-tiered
or single-tiered pricing.
Aggregation interval
The interval at which usage is aggregated to compute cost for
pricing tiers .
Intervals include:
ONE_DAY : Indicates that usage for tiered pricing is
aggregated every day.

$1 per 1000000 Bytes, then this column will show 1000000.
Tiered usage start
Lower bound amount for a given
pricing tier , in pricing units.
For example, a SKU with three pricing tiers such as 0-100 units, 101-1000

1001 as the Tiered usage start values.
List price
The list price of the Google Cloud or Google Maps Platform SKUs and
SKU tiers, as of the date you view the pricing table.
Contract price
Note: This field is only applicable for Cloud Billing
accounts associated with contract pricing.
If you have billing-account-specific pricing, this is your custom contract
price.
Effective discount
Note: This field is only applicable for Cloud Billing
accounts associated with contract pricing.
This is the effective discount per SKU price and pricing tier calculated
using the current list price.
Formula used:
Effective discount = (List price - Contract price) / List price ×
100
If the list price and contact price are zero, this field is the same as
Discount .
If your contract does not have the optional feature
LIST_PRICE_AS_CEILING enabled, the effective
discount can be a negative percentage if the SKU has a
FIXED_DISCOUNT and the current list price is lower than the
list price on the date of the contract agreement.
See the Discount fixed date
for the date used when the discount was set.
If you have questions regarding pricing per SKU, contact your Account team
for more details.
About pricing tiers
SKU prices are offered by pricing tiers. Pricing tiers provide a pricing
structure based on different tier levels. Some SKUs have only a single
pricing tier while others have multiple pricing tiers. Examples of SKUs with
multi-tiered pricing include the following:
SKUs with a free usage tier. For example: 1-1000 units are free. 1001+ units
are priced at $1 each.
SKUs where the price per unit decreases after the usage quantity within a
tier is exceeded. For example: 1-100 units are priced at $5 each, 101-1000
units are priced at $4 each, and 1001+ units are priced at $3 each.
Some notes about multi-tiered pricing:
The tier usage counter resets to zero based on the
Aggregation interval of the SKU: daily or monthly.
Daily SKUs reset each day at 12 AM US and Canadian Pacific Time (UTC-8).
Monthly SKUs reset to zero on the first day of each
calendar month (example: January, February, and so on), at 12 AM
US and Canadian Pacific Time (UTC-8).
Tiers operate independently for each Cloud Billing account and don't
aggregate across multiple Cloud Billing accounts, even if the projects are
in the same Organization or belong to the same legal entity.
Tiers operate independently per SKU: The usage of one SKU can only affect
the price of that SKU. Currently, there are no SKUs in which usage affects
the tiered pricing of another SKU.
It's possible that the SKU pricing tiers for list prices might
not line up exactly with the pricing tiers for contract prices. This
circumstance is rare.
If a SKU has multiple pricing tiers, each SKU tier price is listed as a
separate row in the pricing table. You can identify SKUs with multiple pricing
tiers using the Tiered usage start .
For example, SKU ID 6F81-5844-456A has three pricing tiers. Here's how the
SKU's pricing tiers are listed in the pricing table:
SKU ID
SKU description
Unit description
Tiered usage start
