Cloud Billing access control and permissions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document describes roles and access permissions for Cloud Billing
accounts.
A Cloud Billing account is set up in Google Cloud and accrues
and calculates costs for your usage of resources and services in
Google Cloud, Google Maps Platform, Firebase, and
Google AI Studio. The Cloud Billing account defines who pays for
the usage costs, and then routes the costs to a linked Google payments
account to pay your bill.
Access permissions for Cloud Billing and Google payments are
configured in two different systems depending on what type of access you want
to provide.
Cloud Billing IAM roles let you control which
users have administrative and cost viewing permissions for specific resources
by setting
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
policies on the resources. Certain Cloud Billing account
permissions also grant access to the associated
Organization Google payments profile
to view payment details, edit forms of payment and payment profile settings,
and make manual payments.
In the Google payments center , you can add users to any
Google payments Organization profile
you manage and grant different levels of access to your
payments users, depending on what they need to do. You can
also configure user email preferences for receiving billing and payments
emails.

Google payments settings & permissions
The access permissions to a Cloud Billing account are
managed using
IAM roles . Certain Cloud Billing account
permissions also grant access to the associated Google payments profile
to view payment details, edit forms of payment and payment profile settings,
and make a manual payment. Billing account permissions can be
configured to let users complete the following tasks:
Open, close, and modify a Cloud Billing account.
View reports and cost data.
View payments details and documents (such as invoices and
statements).
Add and edit (but not remove) payment methods.
Edit payments profile and account settings.
Make a manual payment.
Analyze and purchase committed use discounts (CUDs).
Enable and manage export of billing data.
Configure budgets and alerts.
Manage billing per project.
Manage user permissions for billing.
Contact billing support.
The access permissions to a Google payments profile are
managed in
Google payments settings . Google payments permissions can
be configured to let users do the following:
Update payments profile info, including mailing
addresses.
Add, edit, and remove payment methods.
Update the primary and backup payment methods assigned to each
payments account.
Manage payments users, including contact details,
email preferences, and user permissions.
With Google payments permissions, users can access and manage
payments profiles and payments accounts
directly in the Google payments center, without needing separate
permissions on the Cloud Billing account.
To fully manage your payments profile and
payments accounts from within the
Cloud Billing console , users need Cloud Billing permissions and Google payments permissions. For example,
a user with the
Billing Account Viewer role on the Cloud Billing
account and assigned as an
Admin with all permissions on the associated Google payments
profile will be able to fully manage the Google payments profile and
accounts directly from the Cloud Billing console .
Cloud Billing access
To grant or limit access to Cloud Billing, you can set an
IAM policy at the
organization level ,
the Cloud Billing account level, or the project
level. Google Cloud resources inherit
the IAM policies of their parent node, which means you can
set a policy at the organization level to apply it to all the
Cloud Billing accounts, projects, and resources in the
organization.
You can control viewing permissions at different levels for different users or
roles by setting access permissions at the Cloud Billing account or
project level.
To grant permission to a user to view the costs of all projects under a
Cloud Billing account, give the user permission to view the costs for
a Cloud Billing account ( billing.accounts.getSpendingInformation ). To
grant permission to a user to view the costs for a specific
project, give the user view permissions for individual
projects ( billing.resourceCosts.get ).
Overview of Cloud Billing roles in IAM
You don't directly give users permissions; instead, you grant them roles ,
which have one or more permissions bundled within them.
You can grant one or more roles to the same user or on the same resource.
The following predefined Cloud Billing IAM roles let you
use access control to enforce separation of duties:
Role
Purpose
Level
Use Case
Billing Account Creator
( roles/billing.creator )
Create new self-serve (online) billing accounts.
Organization
Use this role for initial billing setup or to allow creation of additional
billing accounts.
Users must have this role to sign up for Google Cloud with a credit card
using their corporate identity.
Tip : Minimize the number of users who have this role to help
prevent proliferation of untracked cloud spend in your organization.
Billing Account Administrator
( roles/billing.admin )
Manage billing accounts (but not create them).
Organization or billing account.
This role is an owner role for a billing account. Admins can add and edit
payment methods, update payments profile info including
mailing addresses, configure billing exports, view cost information, make
a manual payment, link and unlink projects, and manage other user roles on the billing account. By default, the person who creates the Cloud Billing account is a Billing Account Administrator for the Cloud Billing
account.
Billing Account Costs Manager
( roles/billing.costsManager )
Manage budgets and view and export cost information of billing accounts
(but not pricing information).
Organization or billing account.
Create, edit, and delete budgets, view billing account cost information
and transactions, and manage the export of billing cost data to
BigQuery. Doesn't confer the right to export pricing data
or view custom pricing in the Pricing page. Doesn't allow the
linking or unlinking of projects or otherwise managing the properties of the
billing account.
Billing Account Viewer
( roles/billing.viewer )
View billing account cost information and transactions.
Organization or billing account.
Billing Account Viewer access is usually granted to finance teams. It
provides read access to cost and payment information, but doesn't confer the
right to link or unlink projects or otherwise manage the properties of the
billing account.
Project Billing Costs Manager
( roles/billing.projectCostsManager )
View billing account cost information scoped to projects.
Organization or billing account.
When granted in conjunction with
cost view permissions on projects ,
Project Billing Costs Manager provides access to billing information scoped to
the projects to which the user has cost access. Billing information scoped
to projects includes access to Reports, FinOps hub, Budgets and alerts, and
Anomalies.
Billing Account User
( roles/billing.user )
Link projects to billing accounts.
Organization or billing account.
This role has very restricted permissions, so you can grant it broadly.
When granted in combination with Project Creator, the two roles let users
create new projects linked to the billing account on which the Billing
Account User role is granted. Or, when granted in combination with the
Project Billing Manager role, the two roles let users link and unlink
projects on the billing account on which the Billing Account User role is
granted.
Project Billing Manager
( roles/billing.projectManager )
Link and unlink the project to and from a billing account.
Organization, folder, or project.
When granted in combination with the Billing Account User role, the
Project Billing Manager role lets users attach the project to the
billing account, but doesn't grant any rights over resources. Project Owners
can use this role to let someone else manage the billing for the
project without granting them resource access.
Note: Other legacy roles (such as Project Owner, Project Editor, and Project
Viewer) also confer some Cloud Billing permissions, such as
cost view permissions on a project .
The Project Owner role is a superset of Project Billing Manager.
The following table lists the details of the predefined IAM
Billing roles, including the permissions bundled within each role.

IAM relationships between organizations, projects, Cloud Billing accounts, and Google payments accounts
Two types of relationships govern the interactions between organizations,
Cloud Billing accounts, and projects: ownership and
payment linkage.
Ownership refers to IAM permission inheritance.
Payment linkages define which Cloud Billing account pays for a
given project.
The following diagram shows the relationship of ownership and payment linkages
for a sample organization.
In the diagram, the Organization node has ownership over Projects 1, 2, and 3,
meaning that it's the IAM permissions parent of the three
projects.
The Cloud Billing account is linked to Projects 1, 2, and 3, meaning
that it pays for costs incurred by the three projects. The
Cloud Billing account can also pay for projects in other organizations,
but the billing account inherits IAM permissions from its parent
organization.
The Cloud Billing account is also associated with a
Google payments profile ,
which stores information like name, address, and payment methods, and linked to
a Google payments account
to pay the bills. Learn how to
manage Google payments profile user permissions .
Although Cloud Billing accounts are linked to projects,
Cloud Billing accounts aren't parents of projects in an
IAM sense, and therefore projects don't inherit permissions
from the Cloud Billing account they're linked to.
In this example, any users who are granted IAM billing
roles on the Organization node also have those roles on the
Cloud Billing account or the projects.
