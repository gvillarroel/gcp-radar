column to understand when the exported billing data was last updated.
pricing_as_of_time
Timestamp
The pricing data applicable to your Cloud Billing account is
generated once each day to prepare it for export to
BigQuery. This is the daily timestamp of when the
pricing data was generated.
Note : The pricing data is current as
of this date, but the same pricing data could've been in effect before
this date.
billing_account_id

The exchange rate from US dollars to the
local currency the Cloud Billing account is configured to
operate in. If the currency of the Cloud Billing account is USD,
the exchange rate defaults to 1.0.
If your Cloud Billing
costs are billed in a non-USD currency, you can convert your
usage costs to USD using this formula:
cost ÷ currency_conversion_rate
= usage cost in US dollars.
When Google charges in local currency, we convert
prices into applicable local currency pursuant to the conversion rates
published by leading financial institutions. This includes any surcharge
collected for billing in non-USD currency. We use the rates that are in
effect on the
pricing_as_of_time .

For the Default consumption model, this value is identical to the billing_account_price field which remains available for backwards compatibility.
See
billing_account_price for more details.
price_info
Struct
Background information about the contract price.
Note: This field is only applicable for Cloud Billing
accounts associated with contract pricing. Otherwise, the field is
null.
price_info.price_reason
String
Background information on the origin of the contract price.
Reasons include:
DEFAULT_PRICE : The default price is the current list
price for the SKU.
FIXED_PRICE : A set fixed price for the SKU applicable
during the terms of the contract agreement.

sources. For example, with merged tiers, each individual tier can be
from a different source with different discount types.
LIST_PRICE_AS_CEILING : This is an optional
contract feature, available to new contracts after March 21, 2022.
When active, if the current list price drops lower than the
custom fixed price , the list price (DEFAULT_PRICE) is used for
the SKU price. Applies to all fixed
price SKUs in the contract, including FIXED_PRICE, FIXED_DISCOUNT,
MIGRATED_PRICE, and MERGED_PRICE.
CONTRACTED_PRICE_PROTECTION : This is applicable for SKUs
that are price protected in your contract. This is rarely used.
Note: This field is only applicable for Cloud Billing
accounts associated with contract pricing. Otherwise, the field is
null.
price_info.discount_percent
Numeric
For contract pricing that's the result of a percent discount
( FIXED_DISCOUNT or FLOATING_DISCOUNT ), this is the
percentage of the discount used.

accounts associated with contract pricing. Otherwise, the field is
null.
price_info.discount_percent_fixed_date
Date
For contact pricing with a percent discount that's anchored to a
specific date ( FIXED_DISCOUNT ), this is the date used.
Note: This field is only applicable for Cloud Billing
accounts associated with contract pricing. Otherwise, the field is
null.
price_info.discount_migrated_from
String
For contract pricing discounts that were migrated from other SKUs
( MIGRATED_PRICE ), this is the source SKU of the discount.
Sometimes when a SKU is split into two, the discount is migrated from the
old SKU to the new SKUs.
Note: This field is only applicable for Cloud Billing
accounts associated with contract pricing. Otherwise, the field is
null.
aggregation_info
Struct
Represents the aggregation level and interval for the
pricing tiers of a single SKU.
aggregation_info.aggregation_level
String
The level at which usage is aggregated to compute cost for
pricing tiers .
Levels include:
ACCOUNT : Indicates a SKU with multi-tiered pricing; SKU
usage for the pricing tiers is aggregated across all projects
in a single Cloud Billing account.
PROJECT : Indicates a SKU with multi-tiered pricing; SKU
usage for the pricing tiers is aggregated per project.
UNKNOWN_AGGREGATION_LEVEL : Indicates a SKU with
single-tier pricing; this is the default value for SKUs with non-tiered
pricing.
aggregation_info.aggregation_interval
String
The interval at which usage is aggregated to compute cost for
pricing tiers .
Intervals include:
ONE_DAY : Indicates a SKU with multi-tiered pricing; SKU
usage for the pricing tiers is aggregated every day.
ONE_MONTH : Indicates a SKU with multi-tiered pricing; SKU
usage for the pricing tiers is aggregated every month.
UNKNOWN_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL : Indicates a SKU with
single-tier pricing; this is the default value for SKUs with non-tiered
pricing.
tiered_rates
Array of Strings
Information about the
pricing tier including the SKU's price in USD and the SKU's
price in the
currency the Cloud Billing account is configured to use.
Some SKUs have only one pricing tier. If a SKU has multiple pricing tiers,
each pricing tier will appear as a different row. You can identify SKUs
with multiple pricing tiers using the
tiered_rates.start_usage_amount .
tiered_rates.pricing_unit_quantity
Float
The SKU's pricing tier unit quantity. For example, if the tier price
is $1 per 1000000 Bytes, then this column will show 1000000.
tiered_rates.start_usage_amount
Float
Lower bound amount for a given
pricing tier , in pricing units.
For example, a SKU with three pricing tiers such as 0-100 units, 101-1000
units, and 1001+ units, would display three pricing rows, with 0, 101, and
1001 as the [tiered_rates].start_usage_amount values.
Note: If a SKU has multiple pricing tiers, each pricing tier
appears as a different row. You can identify SKUs with multiple pricing
tiers using the tiered_rates.start_usage_amount .
tiered_rates.usd_amount
Numeric
The price for the SKU, in US dollars.
Note: If a SKU has multiple
pricing tiers , each pricing tier appears as a different row.
You can identify SKUs with multiple pricing tiers using the
tiered_rates.start_usage_amount .
tiered_rates.account_currency_amount
Numeric
The SKU's tier price converted from USD to the
currency the Cloud Billing account is configured to use,
using the
currency_conversion_rate .
This converted price is calculated using the following formula:
tiered_rates.usd_amount * currency_conversion_rate =
tiered_rates.account_currency_amount .
When Google charges in local currency, we convert
prices into applicable local currency pursuant to the conversion rates
published by leading financial institutions. This includes any surcharge
collected for billing in non-USD currency. We use the rates that are in
effect on the
pricing_as_of_time .
About pricing tiers
SKU prices are offered by pricing tiers. Pricing tiers provide a pricing
structure based on different tier levels. Some SKUs have only a single
pricing tier while others have multiple pricing tiers. Examples of SKUs with
multi-tiered pricing include the following:
SKUs with a free usage tier. For example: 1-1000 units are free. 1001+ units
are priced at $1 each.
SKUs where the price per unit decreases after the usage quantity within a
tier is exceeded. For example: 1-100 units are priced at $5 each, 101-1000
units are priced at $4 each, and 1001+ units are priced at $3 each.
Some notes about multi-tiered pricing:
The tier usage counter resets to zero based on the
aggregation_interval of the SKU: daily or monthly.
Daily SKUs reset each day at 12 AM US and Canadian Pacific Time (UTC-8 or
UTC-7).
Monthly SKUs reset to zero on the first day of each
calendar month (example: January, February, and so on), at 12 AM
US and Canadian Pacific Time (UTC-8 or UTC-7).
Tiers operate independently for each Cloud Billing account and don't
aggregate across multiple Cloud Billing accounts, even if the projects are
in the same Organization or belong to the same legal entity.
Tiers operate independently per SKU: The usage of one SKU can only affect
the price of that SKU. There are no SKUs in which usage affects
the tiered pricing of another SKU.
It's possible that the SKU pricing tiers for list prices might
not line up exactly with the pricing tiers for contract prices. This
circumstance is rare.
If a SKU has multiple pricing tiers, each SKU tier price is listed as a
separate row in the pricing table. You can identify SKUs with multiple pricing
tiers using the tiered_rates.start_usage_amount .
Depending on how you write your query, you can return your SKU pricing tiers
as nested or unnested data. For more information about nested and unnested
data,
see the following examples .
Pricing data query examples
This section provides examples of how to query the Cloud Billing pricing data exported to BigQuery.
Get list prices for a specific SKU
Get list prices for a specific SKU, and include service description
Example 1: Returns nested data
Example 2: Returns unnested data joined with the same table
Use product taxonomy and geo taxonomy to query SKUs
Get the product taxonomy of a SKU
Get all SKUs for a specific product taxonomy
Get all SKUs for a specific geo taxonomy and product taxonomy
This section provides different examples of how to query the
Cloud Billing pricing data
exported to BigQuery.
Common values used in the example pricing queries
The query examples in this section use the following values:
Table name :
project.dataset.cloud_pricing_export
SKU ID : 2DA5-55D3-E679 (Cloud Run - Requests)
Get list prices for a specific SKU
This example demonstrates a query that returns the
list_price
for each
pricing tier
for a specified SKU.
Standard SQL
SELECT sku . id , sku . description , list_price . *
FROM ` project . dataset . cloud_pricing_export `
WHERE DATE ( _PARTITIONTIME ) = "2020-07-20"
AND sku . id = "2DA5-55D3-E679"
;
_PARTITIONTIME is a field auto-generated by BigQuery
and represents the date that the data belongs to. Instead of _PARTITIONTIME ,
you can use a field that Cloud Billing export explicitly generates,
such as
pricing_as_of_time .
Here's the same query configured to use the pricing_as_of_time field:
SELECT sku . id , sku . description , list_price . *
FROM ` project . dataset . cloud_pricing_export `
WHERE DATE ( pricing_as_of_time ) = "2020-07-20"
AND sku . id = "2DA5-55D3-E679"

Get list prices for a specific SKU, and include service description
The two examples in this section demonstrate queries that return the
list_price
for each pricing tier
for a specified SKU, and includes the SKU description and the service
description.
Example 1 returns one SKU per row, with the pricing tiers displayed as
nested data.
Example 2 demonstrates unnesting the data to return one row per SKU
per pricing tier.
Example 1: Returns nested data
This example queries a single SKU to return the
list_price
data. This SKU has multiple
pricing tiers .
The list price field values display in individual rows that are nested under
the SKU ID row.
Standard SQL
SELECT sku . id AS sku_id ,
sku . description AS sku_description ,
service . id AS service_id ,
service . description as service_description ,
list_price . *
FROM my - billing - admin - project . my_billing_dataset . cloud_pricing_export

Example 2: Returns unnested data joined with the same table
This example queries a single SKU to return the
list price .
The SKU has multiple
pricing tiers .
The query demonstrates using the
UNNEST
operator to
flatten the tiered_rates array
and join the fields with the same table, resulting in one row per pricing
tier.
Standard SQL
SELECT sku . id AS sku_id ,
sku . description AS sku_description ,
service . id AS service_id ,
service . description as service_description ,
tier . *
FROM ` my - billing - admin - project . my_billing_dataset . cloud_pricing_export ` as sku_pricing , UNNEST ( sku_pricing . list_price . tiered_rates ) as tier
WHERE DATE ( _PARTITIONTIME ) = "2020-07-20"
AND sku . id = "2DA5-55D3-E679"
;
Query results:
Row
sku_id
sku_description
service_id
service_description
pricing_unit_quantity
start_usage_amount
usd_amount
account_currency_amount
