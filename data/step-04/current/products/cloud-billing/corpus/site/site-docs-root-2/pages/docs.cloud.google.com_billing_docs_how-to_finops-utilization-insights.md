The FinOps hub Utilization insights dashboard focuses on insights and
recommendations for workload optimization and waste reduction. In the dashboard,
you can view the estimated costs of potentially wasted usage, and take action
on recommendations to reduce waste and optimize your costs.
You might use the FinOps hub Utilization insights dashboard when you want to do
the following:
View the cost of potentially wasted resources, such as idle, underprovisioned,
or overprovisioned resources, and suboptimal configurations.
Verify that resources in your projects or
App Hub
applications are used efficiently.
Understand and prioritize cost optimization opportunities.
Collaborate with Google Cloud project owners, solution owners, and DevOps managers
to implement changes to optimize workloads and reduce waste.
Limitations
When viewing insights By Service , you can view one service at a time.
When filtering utilization insights by project, you can view all projects
for an aggregated view, or select up to 10 projects for a more granular view
of your potential wasted usage.
Utilization insights are refreshed once a day.
The waste map and resource recommendations table showcase up to 1000
resources and includes the costliest resources based on costs for the last
30 days.
Some resource insights might not have an optimization recommendation.
When viewing insights By Application , you can view
one App Hub application at a time.
Utilization insights are available for one Cloud Billing account
at a time. The resources used in an App Hub application can
be spread across projects in different organizations and billing accounts.
If the projects that make up the application span multiple billing accounts,
the utilization insights are limited to the projects that are linked to the
billing account you are viewing, and might only be a partial view of
insights for the application.
Permissions required to access the FinOps hub Utilization insights
To access the FinOps hub Utilization insights dashboard, you need the same
permissions that are required to
access to the FinOps hub .
To view the details of a resource recommendation, you need the
Recommender Viewer role
on your Cloud Billing account. Depending on the type of recommendation,
you might also need project permissions to view the details and apply a
recommendation.
When viewing insights by Application , to view metadata about the application,
such as Owner , Criticality , and Environment , you need the
apphub.applications.get permission. You can gain this permission using the
App Hub Viewer
predefined role.
Open the Utilization insights dashboard
To open the Utilization insights dashboard:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the FinOps hub.
Go to FinOps hub
At the prompt, choose the Cloud Billing account for which you want to
view the FinOps hub.
In the FinOps hub , from the Potential wasted usage chart, click
View utilization insights .
Explore the Utilization insights dashboard
With the Utilization insights dashboard, you can gain better control over
your Google Cloud spending, eliminate waste, and optimize your resource
utilization for maximum cost efficiency.
The dashboard supports insights for Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine,
Cloud Run, Cloud SQL services, and App Hub applications.
You can view utilization insights By Service or By Application .
When you first open the Utilization insights dashboard, by default, the
page shows all insights By Service for the selected service, for all
projects.
When you are viewing utilization insights By Service , you can configure
the dashboard with different service and project selections, one service
at a time:
You can select a different service from the Services drop-down.
The options available in the Services drop-down are limited to the
services with active utilization insights .
You can use the Projects drop-down to focus the page on a smaller set
of insights and recommendations. The options available in the Projects
drop-down are limited to the projects that have resources with
active utilization insights .
When you are viewing insights By Application , you can view insights for one
App Hub application at a time.
The selected App Hub application might incur usage and costs in
more than one billing account and associated projects. Insights available
by application might be based on partial data, limited to projects and
costs for the Cloud Billing account you are actively viewing.
Utilization insights by application only supports applications in a folder
configured for application management. It doesn't support applications in a
host project or single-project boundary .
If you want to view cost data by App Hub application, then ensure
that you have
set up App Hub for a folder
and created your applications.
Insights provided by Gemini Cloud Assist
If you enabled
Gemini Cloud Assist in Cloud Billing ,
you can use the Gemini-provided insights to summarize and send
top wasted usage insights to your engineering teams to take action and
remediate.
If you have more than 10 projects in your billing account with utilization
insights, you can select
filter_list
Focus on the top projects to filter the utilization insights by the
projects with the highest amount of potential cost savings.
Click Draft an email report to prompt Gemini Cloud Assist
to generate a
draft of the insights and top recommendations .
You can copy the content of the report to send it in an email, chat, a
ticketing system, or any other tool you use.
Utilization summary panel
The values in the Utilization summary panel are updated based on the service
and projects selected, or based on the selected application.
Resources with potentially wasted usage : The total number of resources for
the selected service and project(s) that have available utilization
metrics.
Estimated cost of wasted usage : For resources with utilization metrics,
this is the estimated cost of those resources over the last 30 days for
the selected service and project(s).
Potential savings/month : Savings that might be achieved through applying
recommendations. Savings don't include existing discounts available through
active Committed Use Discounts (CUDs).
Click View recommendations to open the
Recommendations
dashboard to view all recommendations for the selected service and
projects.
Waste map
The Waste map provides a visual representation of the top costs by estimated
cost of waste. The map can help you to quickly identify the most important
utilization areas to tackle first.
If you are viewing utilization insights for all projects, the estimated cost
of waste is aggregated across all projects in the service, broken down by
the optimization categories for the service you are viewing (such as Idle ,
Overprovisioned , Underprovisioned , and Suboptimal configuration ).
If you are viewing the utilization insights for 1 to 10 projects, the map
provides a visual representation of the costs in each project broken down by
the optimization categories for the service you are viewing.
The size of each box corresponds to the cost of resources; larger
boxes indicate a higher estimated cost of waste.
When you hold the pointer over any of the boxes in the waste map, you'll
see a tooltip for the box, with additional details about the values in the
box (such as the optimization category, the estimated cost of the optimization
category, the number of resources with potentially wasted usage, and the
project ID).
Resource recommendations table
The resource recommendations table lists up to 1000 resources that are
identified with potentially wasted usage. The table includes the costliest
resources for the selected service, based on costs for the last 30 days, and
an optimization recommendation for each resource.
Supported services and optimization categories
The Utilization insights dashboard provides recommendations about potentially
wasted usage for the following services and optimization categories:
Service
Optimization categories
Compute Engine
Idle VM instances
Overprovisioned VM instances
Underprovisioned VM instances
Idle disks
Suboptimal configuration: Identified as VM instances using
custom machine configurations
that appear identical to standard,
predefined machine types. Recommend switching to a standard machine type,
which is less expensive to use than a custom machine type.
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
Idle clusters
Overprovisioned clusters
Underprovisioned clusters
Cloud SQL
Idle SQL instances
Overprovisioned SQL instances
Underprovisioned SQL instances
Cloud Run
Suboptimal configuration: The recommender looks at
CPU allocation configuration and determines if there is a different
billing model available that would be less expensive to use.
App Hub applications
The dashboard provides the costs of the wasted resources in the
application, their associated recommendations, and metadata about the
application, such as Owner , Criticality , and
Environment .
Columns in the resource recommendations table
The following data is available in the resource recommendations table.
By default, the rows in the table are sorted by Last 30 day cost , in
descending order – highest cost to lowest cost. You can change the sort order
of the data by clicking on a different column header.

utilization insights. Metrics are calculated at the 95th percentile (P95) for
the last 30 days. In some cases, metrics values won't be present. For example,
Cloud Run doesn't provide metrics as it is a managed service.
CPU: 35%, Memory: 100%, No running pods
Utilization metric 2
For the specific resource, the secondary metric that is analyzed to
determine utilization insights. Metrics are calculated at the 95th percentile
(P95) for the last 30 days. In some cases, metrics values won't be present.
Memory: 20%, CPU 11.72%
CUD benefit
'Yes' indicates that the resource has an active, purchased Committed Use
Discount (CUD) and that a portion of the cost was covered with a CUD. 'No'
indicates that the resource isn't covered by an active CUD.
Yes or No
