Example queries for Cloud Billing data export
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This document provides some examples of how to query the Cloud Billing
data exported to and stored in BigQuery.
For more information about exporting your billing data to
BigQuery, see the
overview
and limitations .
Generate a SQL query from a Billing Report
To quickly write a SQL query that returns the equivalent results in
BigQuery as the results in a Billing Report, you can use the
Generate query
feature in the
Billing Reports ,
available in the Google Cloud console.
Specify the table name to use in your queries
Interactive tutorial: Analyze billing data with BigQuery
(20 minutes)
Get started with billing data exports using this interactive tutorial.
In the tutorial, you'll enable Cloud Billing data to export to a
BigQuery dataset. Next, you'll run some sample queries
through the BigQuery web interface to examine billing
data.
Launch the billing data export tutorial
In these examples, to query your exported Cloud Billing data in
BigQuery, you need to specify the full path to the table name in
the FROM clause. The table name is determined using three values separated
by dots:
project-ID.dataset_name.BQ_table_name
project-ID is the ID of the
Google Cloud project you set up
that contains your BigQuery dataset.
dataset_name is the name of the
BigQuery dataset you set up
to contain the BigQuery tables with your exported
Cloud Billing data.
BQ_table_name is the name of the
BigQuery table
that contains the exported Cloud Billing data that you want to query.
The BigQuery tables that contain the exported
Cloud Billing data are automatically assigned a name, based on the
type of export you enable :
Standard usage cost table :
In your BigQuery dataset, this table is named
gcp_billing_export_v1_<BILLING-ACCOUNT-ID> .
Detailed usage cost table :
In your BigQuery dataset, this table is named
gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_<BILLING-ACCOUNT-ID> .
Pricing table :
In your BigQuery dataset, this table is named
cloud_pricing_export .
For example, assume you have a Cloud Billing account that's
configured to export
detailed usage cost data and the components of the billing export
configuration are as follows:
project-ID : my-billing-project
dataset_name : my_billing_dataset
BQ_table_name : gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_<BILLING-ACCOUNT-ID>
BILLING-ACCOUNT-ID : 010101-F0FFF0-10X10X – this is the ID of the
Cloud Billing account that contains the billing data that you're
exporting. Learn how to
find your billing account ID .
Based on the example values, you'd write the FROM clause as follows:
my-billing-project.my_billing_dataset.gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_010101-F0FFF0-10X10X
Example queries by Cloud Billing data type
This section provides query examples for your
standard usage cost data ,

Standard usage cost query examples
This section provides examples of how to query the
Cloud Billing standard usage cost data
exported to BigQuery.
These query examples also work with the
detailed usage cost data
exported to BigQuery, although they aren't written to retrieve
any of the resource-level information that's provided with the detailed
usage cost export option.
Common values used in the example standard cost queries
The query examples in this section use the following value for Table name :
project-ID.dataset.gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX
Return the total costs on an invoice
The following queries demonstrate two ways of viewing cost and credit values
using exported billing data.
The total field directly sums the floating point cost and credit values,
which can result in floating point rounding errors.
The total_exact field converts costs and credit values to micros before
summing, then converts back to dollars after summing, avoiding the
floating point rounding error.
Example 1: Sum of all costs, per invoice
This query shows the invoice total for each month, as a sum of regular costs,
taxes, adjustments, and rounding errors.
Standard SQL
SELECT
invoice . month ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount )
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))
AS total ,
( SUM ( CAST ( cost AS NUMERIC ))
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( CAST ( c . amount AS NUMERIC ))
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) AS c ), 0 )))
AS total_exact
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 ASC
;
For example, the result of the preceding query might be:
Row
month
total
total_exact
1
201901
$1005.004832999999984
$1005.00

$992.31
3
201903
$1220.761089999999642
$1220.76
Example 2: Return details by cost type, per invoice month
This query shows the totals for each cost_type for each month. Cost types
include regular costs, taxes, adjustments, and rounding errors.
Standard SQL
SELECT
invoice . month ,
cost_type ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount )
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))
AS total ,
( SUM ( CAST ( cost AS NUMERIC ))
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( CAST ( c . amount AS NUMERIC ))
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) AS c ), 0 )))
AS total_exact
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
GROUP BY 1 , 2
ORDER BY 1 ASC , 2 ASC
;
For example, the result of the preceding query might be:
Row

Query examples with labels
Note: Certain fields such as labels and credits are repeated. Read more about
working with arrays in BigQuery Standard SQL .
The following examples illustrate other ways to query your data with labels.
For the examples in this section, assume the following:
You have two apps (grapefruit-squeezer and chocolate-masher).
For each app, you have two environments (dev and prod).
The dev environment has one small instance per app.
The prod environment has one small instance in Americas and one small instance in
Asia.
Each instance is labeled with the app and environment.
You have one instance with no labels that you use for experimentation.
Your total bill is $24 with the following breakdown:
Instance
Labels
Total Cost
Small instance with 1 VCPU running in Americas
None
$4
Small instance with 1 VCPU running in Americas
app: chocolate-masher
environment: dev
$2
Small instance with 1 VCPU running in Americas
app: grapefruit-squeezer
environment: dev
$3
Small instance with 1 VCPU running in Americas
app: chocolate-masher
environment: prod
$3.25
Small instance with 1 VCPU running in Asia
app: chocolate-masher
environment: prod
$3.75
Small instance with 1 VCPU running in Americas
app: grapefruit-squeezer
environment: prod
$3.50
Small instance with 1 VCPU running in Asia
app: grapefruit-squeezer
environment: prod
$4.50
Query every row without grouping
The most granular view of these costs would be to query every row without
grouping. Assume all fields, except labels and sku description, are the same
(project, service, and so on).
Standard SQL
SELECT
sku . description ,
TO_JSON_STRING ( labels ) as labels ,
cost as cost
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX ` ;
Legacy SQL
TO_JSON_STRING not supported .

Group by label map as a JSON string
This is a basic way to break down cost by each label combination.
Standard SQL
SELECT
TO_JSON_STRING ( labels ) as labels ,
sum ( cost ) as cost
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
GROUP BY labels ;
Legacy SQL
TO_JSON_STRING not supported .

TOTAL
$24
Group by label value for a specific key
Breaking down costs for values of a specific label key is a common use case. By
using a LEFT JOIN and putting the key filter in the JOIN condition (rather
than WHERE ), you include cost that doesn't contain this key, and so receive a
complete view of your cost.
Standard SQL
SELECT
labels . value as environment ,
SUM ( cost ) as cost
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
LEFT JOIN UNNEST ( labels ) as labels
ON labels . key = "environment"
GROUP BY environment ;
Legacy SQL
SELECT
labels . value as environment ,
SUM ( cost ) as cost
FROM [ project - ID : dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX ]
WHERE labels . key = "environment" OR labels . key IS NULL
GROUP BY environment ;
Row
environment
cost
1
prod
$15
2
dev
$5
3
null
$4
TOTAL
$24
Note: The total cost should add up to the same amount as a group by label map
query.
Group by key/value pairs
Warning: Combining results can result in double counting usage.
Be careful when interpreting or exporting these results. An individual row here
shows a valid sum without any double counting, but shouldn't be combined with
other rows (except possibly if the key is the same, or if you're certain the
keys are never set on the same resource).
Standard SQL
SELECT
labels . key as key ,
labels . value as value ,
SUM ( cost ) as cost
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
LEFT JOIN UNNEST ( labels ) as labels
GROUP BY key , value ;
Legacy SQL
SELECT
labels . key as key ,
labels . value as value ,
SUM ( cost )
FROM [ project - ID : dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX ]
GROUP BY key , value ;

Note that the total sum is greater than your bill.
Committed use discount queries
The following queries demonstrate ways of viewing the fees and credits
associated with
committed use discounts
in exported billing data. To understand how your commitment fees and credits
are attributed to your Cloud Billing account and projects, see
Attribution of committed use discounts .
Viewing commitment fees
To view the commitment fees for your
committed use discounts
in your billing data export, use the following sample query.
Standard SQL
SELECT
invoice . month AS invoice_month ,
SUM ( cost ) as commitment_fees
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
WHERE LOWER ( sku . description ) LIKE "commitment%"
GROUP BY 1
Viewing commitment credits
To view your
committed use discount
credits in your billing data export, use the following sample query.
Note: If you want to modify this example and get accurate results,
you must use the LEFT JOIN UNNEST statement with the filter on credits.name
or a filter on a different field in credits . If you want to remove the filter
on credits.name , we recommend removing the LEFT JOIN UNNEST statement, and
using a nested SELECT query to get credits, similar to the
example for querying costs by project .
Standard SQL
SELECT
invoice . month AS invoice_month ,
SUM ( credits . amount ) as CUD_credits
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
LEFT JOIN UNNEST ( credits ) AS credits
WHERE credits . type = "COMMITTED_USAGE_DISCOUNT"
GROUP BY 1
Use resource hierarchy filters to review ancestry
You can use resource hierarchy filters to aggregate costs by hierarchy elements
such as projects, folders, and organizations. These query examples show methods
for summing costs filtered by resource hierarchy elements and displaying project
ancestries.
Example 1: Filter by resource name
This example demonstrates queries that group costs by project ancestry and
filter for only costs generated under a specified hierarchy element, identified
by the relative resource name.
String method
SELECT
invoice . month AS invoice_month ,
TO_JSON_STRING ( project . ancestors ) as ancestors ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount ) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))
AS net_cost
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX ` as bq
WHERE TO_JSON_STRING ( project . ancestors ) like "%resource_name\" : \ "folders/1234"
GROUP BY invoice_month , ancestors
ORDER BY invoice_month , ancestors
UNNEST method
SELECT
invoice . month AS invoice_month ,
TO_JSON_STRING ( project . ancestors ) as ancestors ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount ) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))
AS net_cost
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX ` as bq , UNNEST ( project . ancestors ) as ancestor
WHERE ancestor . resource_name = "folders/1234"
GROUP BY invoice_month , ancestors
ORDER BY invoice_month , ancestors
Example 2: Filter by display name
This example demonstrates queries that group costs by project ancestry and
filter for only costs generated under a specified hierarchy element, identified
by the user-provided display name.
String matching method
SELECT
invoice . month AS invoice_month ,
TO_JSON_STRING ( project . ancestors ) as ancestors ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount ) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))
AS net_cost
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX ` as bq
WHERE TO_JSON_STRING ( project . ancestors ) like "%display_name\" : \ "MyFolderName%"
GROUP BY invoice_month , ancestors
ORDER BY invoice_month , ancestors
UNNEST method
SELECT
invoice . month AS invoice_month ,
TO_JSON_STRING ( project . ancestors ) as ancestors ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount ) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))
AS net_cost
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX ` as bq , UNNEST ( project . ancestors ) as ancestor
WHERE ancestor . display_name = "MyFolderName"
GROUP BY invoice_month , ancestors
ORDER BY invoice_month , ancestors
Query examples with tags
The following examples illustrate ways to query your data with tags.
Calculate costs by invoice month with tags
The following query demonstrates how you can use return costs by invoice month
for the cost_center tag.
SELECT
invoice . month AS invoice_month ,
tag . value AS cost_center ,
ROUND (( SUM ( CAST ( cost AS NUMERIC ))
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( CAST ( c . amount AS NUMERIC ))
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) AS c ), 0 ))), 2 )
AS net_cost
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX ` , UNNEST ( tags ) AS tag
WHERE tag . key = "cost_center" AND tag . namespace = "821092389413"
GROUP BY invoice . month , tag . value
ORDER BY invoice . month , tag . value ;
For example, the result of the preceding query might be:
Row

View costs of untagged resources
This query shows the invoice total for untagged resources, grouped by invoice
month.
SELECT
invoice . month AS invoice_month ,
ROUND (( SUM ( CAST ( cost AS NUMERIC ))
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( CAST ( c . amount AS NUMERIC ))
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) AS c ), 0 ))), 2 )
AS net_cost
FROM
` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
WHERE "color" NOT IN ( SELECT key FROM UNNEST ( tags ))
GROUP BY invoice_month
ORDER BY invoice_month ;

Query costs to view corrections or late-monetized usage for a specified invoice month
By providing a specific invoice month and filtering by date where the
usage date occurred before the invoice month, this simplified query returns
cost totals for corrections or late-monetized usage (charges that should have
been on a previous invoice).
Standard SQL
SELECT
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount )
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))
AS total
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
WHERE
invoice . month = '202403' AND
DATE ( TIMESTAMP_TRUNC ( usage_start_time , Day , 'US/Pacific' )) '2024-03-01' ;
For example, the result of the preceding query might be:
Row

Query cost details to view corrections or late-monetized usage by service for a specified invoice month
This example demonstrates a query that returns a cost breakdown by service, for
invoice charges, where the usage date occurred before the invoice month.
This query returns cost and credit totals by service for corrections or
late-monetized usage (charges that should have been on a previous invoice).
In this query example, the WHERE clause filters for all charges with an
invoice month of March 2024 (in the format YYYYMM), then further refines the
results to return only those invoice month charges that have a usage date
before March 1, 2024.
SELECT
DATE ( TIMESTAMP_TRUNC ( usage_start_time , Day , 'US/Pacific' )) AS ` Day ` ,
service . description AS ` Service Description ` ,
SUM ( CAST ( cost_at_list AS NUMERIC )) AS ` List cost ` ,
SUM ( CAST ( cost AS NUMERIC )) - SUM ( CAST ( cost_at_list AS NUMERIC )) AS ` Negotiated savings ` ,
SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( CAST ( c . amount AS numeric )) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c WHERE c . type IN ( 'SUSTAINED_USAGE_DISCOUNT' , 'DISCOUNT' , 'SPENDING_BASED_DISCOUNT' , 'COMMITTED_USAGE_DISCOUNT' , 'FREE_TIER' , 'COMMITTED_USAGE_DISCOUNT_DOLLAR_BASE' , 'SUBSCRIPTION_BENEFIT' , 'RESELLER_MARGIN' )), 0 )) AS ` Discounts ` ,
SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( CAST ( c . amount AS numeric )) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c WHERE c . type IN ( 'CREDIT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED' , 'PROMOTION' )), 0 )) AS ` Promotions and others ` ,
SUM ( CAST ( cost_at_list AS NUMERIC )) + SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( CAST ( c . amount AS numeric )) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c WHERE c . type IN ( 'SUSTAINED_USAGE_DISCOUNT' , 'DISCOUNT' , 'SPENDING_BASED_DISCOUNT' , 'COMMITTED_USAGE_DISCOUNT' , 'FREE_TIER' , 'COMMITTED_USAGE_DISCOUNT_DOLLAR_BASE' , 'SUBSCRIPTION_BENEFIT' , 'RESELLER_MARGIN' )), 0 )) + SUM ( CAST ( cost AS NUMERIC )) - SUM ( CAST ( cost_at_list AS NUMERIC )) + SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( CAST ( c . amount AS numeric )) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c WHERE c . type IN ( 'CREDIT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED' , 'PROMOTION' )), 0 )) AS ` Subtotal `

Detailed usage cost query examples
This section provides examples of how to query the
Cloud Billing detailed usage cost data
exported to BigQuery.
Because the detailed usage cost schema includes all of the fields from the
standard usage cost schema, the query examples provided for the
standard data
exported to BigQuery also work with the detailed data that's
exported. The standard query examples aren't written to retrieve
any of the resource-level information that's provided with the detailed
usage cost export option. When creating queries for the detailed data, you
can use a standard query example as a template, update the Table name ,
and add any of the fields that are available in the
detailed usage cost schema .
For further requirements and limitations to the detailed data exported,
see Schema of the detailed usage cost data .
Common values used in the example detailed cost queries
The query examples in this section use the following value for Table name :
project-ID.dataset.gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX
Return the resource-level costs on an invoice
The following queries demonstrate two ways of viewing resource-level cost and
credit values on an invoice using exported billing data.
The total field directly sums the floating point cost and credit values,
which can result in floating point rounding errors.
The total_exact field converts costs and credit values to micros before
summing, then converts back to dollars after summing, avoiding the
floating point rounding error.
Sum costs for each resource, per invoice
This query shows the invoice total for each resource.name per month, as a sum
of regular costs, taxes, adjustments, and rounding errors. Any costs not
associated with a resource-level item are aggregated under the name null
for the month.
Standard SQL
SELECT
invoice . month ,
resource . name ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount )
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))
AS total ,
( SUM ( CAST ( cost AS NUMERIC ))
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( CAST ( c . amount AS NUMERIC ))
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) AS c ), 0 )))
AS total_exact
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
GROUP BY 1 , 2
ORDER BY 1 ASC , 2 ASC
;
For example, the result of the preceding query might be:
Row

Return details by cost type for each resource, per invoice month
This query shows the totals for each cost_type for each resource.name per
month. Cost types include regular costs, taxes, adjustments, and rounding
errors. Any costs not associated with a resource-level item are aggregated
under the name null for the month.
Standard SQL
SELECT
invoice . month ,
cost_type ,
resource . name ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount )
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))
AS total ,

Get breakdown of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster costs
This section provides examples of filtering GKE cluster costs in
your BigQuery export reports. To learn more about GKE
cluster costs, visit
View breakdown of cluster costs .
Filter GKE costs
The following example queries show you how to filter and group your
GKE costs for supported resource types by cluster name,
namespace, and label.
GKE cluster costs before credits
SELECT
SUM ( cost ) AS cost_before_credits ,
labels . value AS cluster_name
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
LEFT JOIN UNNEST ( labels ) as labels
ON labels . key = "goog-k8s-cluster-name"
GROUP BY labels . value
;
GKE costs after credits by namespace
SELECT
labels . value as namespace ,
SUM ( cost ) + SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount ) FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 )) AS cost_after_credits ,
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
LEFT JOIN UNNEST ( labels ) as labels
ON labels . key = "k8s-namespace"
GROUP BY namespace
;
GKE costs by SKU
SELECT
project . id AS project_id ,
labels . value AS cluster_name ,
sku . id AS sku_id ,
sku . description AS sku_description ,
SUM ( cost ) AS cost
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
JOIN UNNEST ( labels ) AS labels
ON labels . key = "goog-k8s-cluster-name"
GROUP BY
cluster_name , project_id , sku_description , sku_id

Pricing data query examples
This section provides different examples of how to query the
Cloud Billing pricing data
exported to BigQuery.
Common values used in the example pricing queries
The query examples in this section use the following values:
Table name :
project-ID.dataset.cloud_pricing_export
SKU ID : 2DA5-55D3-E679 (Cloud Run - Requests)
Get list prices for a specific SKU
This example demonstrates a basic query that returns the
list_price
for each
pricing tier
for a specified SKU.
Standard SQL
SELECT sku . id , sku . description , list_price . *
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . cloud_pricing_export `
WHERE DATE ( _PARTITIONTIME ) = "2020-07-20"
AND sku . id = "2DA5-55D3-E679"
;
_PARTITIONTIME is a field auto-generated by BigQuery
and represents the date that the data belongs to. Instead of _PARTITIONTIME ,
you can use a field that Cloud Billing export explicitly generates,
such as
pricing_as_of_time .
Here's the same query configured to use the pricing_as_of_time field:
SELECT sku . id , sku . description , list_price . *
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . cloud_pricing_export `
WHERE DATE ( pricing_as_of_time ) = "2020-07-20"
AND sku . id = "2DA5-55D3-E679"
;

Get list prices for a specific SKU, and include service description
The two examples in this section demonstrate queries that return the
list_price
for each
pricing tier
for a specified SKU, and includes the SKU description and the service
description.
Example 1 returns one SKU per row, with the pricing tiers displayed as
nested data.
Example 2 demonstrates unnesting the data to return one row per SKU
per pricing tier.
Example 1: Returns nested data
This example queries a single SKU to return the
list_price data. This SKU has multiple
pricing tiers .
The list price field values display in individual rows that are nested under
the SKU ID row.
Standard SQL
SELECT sku . id AS sku_id ,
sku . description AS sku_description ,
service . id AS service_id ,
service . description as service_description ,
list_price . *
FROM project - ID . dataset . cloud_pricing_export
WHERE DATE ( _PARTITIONTIME ) = "2020-07-20"
AND sku . id = "2DA5-55D3-E679"
;

Example 2: Returns unnested data joined with the same table
This example queries a single SKU to return the
list price . The SKU has multiple
pricing tiers .
The query demonstrates using the
UNNEST
operator to
flatten the tiered_rates array
and join the fields with the same table, resulting in one row per pricing
tier.
Standard SQL
SELECT sku . id AS sku_id ,
sku . description AS sku_description ,
service . id AS service_id ,
service . description as service_description ,
tier . *
FROM ` project - ID . dataset . cloud_pricing_export ` as sku_pricing , UNNEST ( sku_pricing . list_price . tiered_rates ) as tier
WHERE DATE ( _PARTITIONTIME ) = "2020-07-20"
AND sku . id = "2DA5-55D3-E679"

Join pricing data with detailed usage cost data
This query shows how to join Price and Cost Data exports, to see detailed
pricing information in line with your costs. You can configure
this query to pull exported data from your
detailed usage cost data (as Exports ),
and join your usage cost data with your exported
pricing data
(as Prices ).
Use your
detailed usage cost table name
to pull the Exports data:
gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID>
Use your
pricing table name
for the Prices data:
project-ID.dataset.cloud_pricing_export
WITH
Exports AS (
SELECT *

Query using system labels
System labels for Google Cloud reservations provide enhanced visibility into
your reservation usage. They allow you to track which instances are
consuming which reservations, and analyze the costs associated with both used and
unused capacity directly within BigQuery.
These examples use two system labels:
compute.googleapis.com/reservation_name
compute.googleapis.com/reservation_project_id
These labels are present on Cloud Billing records from both instances
consuming a reservation and the unused portion of a reservation.
The following examples demonstrate how to query the BigQuery
billing export to analyze reservation consumption using system labels.
Important: These reservation labels are present in Cloud Billing export
data for usage on or after September 17, 2025. Historical data prior to this
date won't include valid labels.
Before you begin
To query using system labels, you must have Cloud Billing export to
BigQuery enabled, specifically the Detailed usage cost data
export. This export contains the resource-level information, including system
labels, necessary to see the new reservation labels.
To set up or verify your BigQuery export, see the following
documentation:
Overview of billing data export to BigQuery
Set up billing data export to BigQuery
Understand the Detailed data export schema
Ensure your BigQuery dataset is configured to receive the
detailed export . The table name will typically be in the format
gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID> .
Note: In the following examples, replace
project-ID.dataset.gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_X
with your actual BigQuery table name.
View consumption for a given instance
This query lets you check if a given instance utilized a reservation
during a particular period and, if so, which reservation it was.
SELECT
t . usage_start_time ,
sl_reservation . value AS reservation_name ,
t . sku . description AS sku_description ,
SUM ( t . usage . amount ) AS total_usage_amount
FROM
project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_X AS t
LEFT JOIN
UNNEST ( t . system_labels ) AS sl_reservation
ON sl_reservation . key = 'compute.googleapis.com/reservation_name'
WHERE
t . service . id = '6F81-5844-456A' AND DATE ( TIMESTAMP_TRUNC ( t . _PARTITIONTIME , DAY )) = '2025-09-16' AND t . sku . description LIKE '%Core%' AND

Note:
SKU Filtering : Limiting the SKU to CPU cores offers clearer
resource distribution. This can be adjusted to other reserved resources,
such as RAM, LocalSSD, TPU, or GPU.
On-Demand Consumption : When both reservation_name and
reservation_project_id are null, the instance is consuming on-demand resources.
When multiple rows with differing reservation_name and reservation_project_id
correspond to a specific instance within a given timeframe, it indicates that
the instance's consumed reservation changed during that period. The usage
portion will detail the consumption.
Analyze usage distribution for a given reservation
This query helps you understand the distribution of usage for a given shared
reservation, showing how much capacity was used or unused among different
Google Cloud projects that can consume the given reservation.
SELECT
t . project . id AS consumer_project_id ,
t . sku . description AS sku_description ,

Analyze Vertex AI reservation usage using BigQuery
To analyze how first-party (1P) products, such as Vertex AI, consume
your shared reservations across projects where Vertex AI
jobs are active, use the following system labels in BigQuery:
compute.googleapis.com/reservation_name
compute.googleapis.com/reservation_project_id
For more information about how to share reservations with first-party (1P)
products in Vertex AI, see the following:
Use reservations with training
Use reservations with online inference
Use reservations with Vertex AI Workbench instances
The following example queries show how to use these labels to get detailed
visibility into your reservation usage, monitor how instances consume these
reservations, and perform in-depth cost analysis.
List SKU types consuming a reservation for a 1P product in Vertex AI
If you create and share a reservation with Vertex AI for a training
job, the following query returns the list of SKU types for the current date.
SELECT DISTINCT
t . sku . description AS sku_description
FROM
project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_X AS t
LEFT JOIN
UNNEST ( t . system_labels ) AS sl_reservation
ON sl_reservation . key = 'compute.googleapis.com/reservation_name'
WHERE
TRUE
AND t . service . id = '6F81-5844-456A'
AND DATE ( t . usage_start_time ) = CURRENT_DATE ()
AND EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM UNNEST ( t . Tags ) AS tag
WHERE
tag . key = 'gcp-product'
AND tag . value = 'vertex_ai'
AND tag . inherited = TRUE
)
AND sl_reservation . value = ' RESERVATION_NAME '
AND t . resource . name IS NOT NULL
AND t . resource . name != ''
ORDER BY sku_description ASC ;
Sample results
The results show that the training job uses three SKU types within the
Vertex AI service.

Analyze SKU statistics by reservation for a 1P product in Vertex AI
The following query helps you understand the distribution of instances and their
usage costs associated with a reservation for a first-party (1P) product in the
current month.
SELECT
t . sku . description AS sku_description ,
t . usage_start_time AS usage_start_time ,
t . usage_end_time AS usage_end_time ,
SUM ( t . usage . amount ) AS total_usage_amount
FROM
project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_X AS t
LEFT JOIN
UNNEST ( t . system_labels ) AS sl_reservation
ON sl_reservation . key = 'compute.googleapis.com/reservation_name'
LEFT JOIN
UNNEST ( t . system_labels ) AS sl_project_id
ON sl_project_id . key = 'compute.googleapis.com/reservation_project_id'
WHERE
TRUE
AND t . service . id = '6F81-5844-456A'
AND t . invoice . month = '202602'
AND EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM UNNEST ( t . Tags ) AS tag
WHERE
tag . key = 'gcp-product'
AND tag . value = 'vertex_ai'
AND tag . inherited = TRUE
)
AND sl_reservation . value = ' RESERVATION_NAME '
AND sl_project_id . value = ' PROJECT_ID '
AND t . resource . name IS NOT NULL
AND t . resource . name != ''
GROUP BY sku_description , usage_start_time , usage_end_time ;
Sample results
The following output shows how SKUs use the reservation and provides a
breakdown of the corresponding usage costs.

Analyze reservation usage for Vertex AI in shared projects
If you use a reservation shared across multiple owner projects where
Vertex AI jobs are active, you can use the following query to analyze
and break down your usage costs by individual project.
Note: The billing account determines the BigQuery table name. For this
data to be visible, all shared projects must use the same billing account;
otherwise, the information might not appear in your results.
SELECT
t . project . id AS consumer_project_id ,
t . sku . description AS sku_description ,
t . usage . unit AS usage_unit ,
SUM ( t . usage . amount ) AS total_usage_amount
FROM
project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_X AS t
LEFT JOIN
UNNEST ( t . system_labels ) AS sl_reservation
ON sl_reservation . key = 'compute.googleapis.com/reservation_name'
LEFT JOIN
UNNEST ( t . system_labels ) AS sl_project_id
ON sl_project_id . key = 'compute.googleapis.com/reservation_project_id'
WHERE
TRUE
AND t . service . id = '6F81-5844-456A'
AND EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM UNNEST ( t . Tags ) AS tag
WHERE
tag . key = 'gcp-product'
AND tag . value = 'vertex_ai'
AND tag . inherited = TRUE
)
AND sl_reservation . value = ' RESERVATION_NAME '
AND sl_project_id . value = ' PROJECT_ID '
GROUP BY
consumer_project_id , sku_description , usage_unit
ORDER BY consumer_project_id , sku_description , usage_unit ;
Sample results
The following output shows the contribution of each project to total
usage costs while consuming the reservation.
