Create custom roles for Cloud Billing accounts
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
includes fine-grained permissions, which lets you grant or revoke access to
specific actions for individual users. To simplify the process of assigning
permissions to users, IAM roles combine these fine-grained
permissions into related groups. Billing has
predefined roles ,
such as Billing Account Administrator or Billing Account Viewer, which
work for most users. But, if they don't fit your needs, custom roles
let you to grant more specific sets of permissions.
Create a custom role
Custom roles are created on the organization, and then are applied to any
billing account in the organization.
Creating and Managing Custom Roles
in the IAM documentation describes how to configure
a custom role, including which permissions are necessary.
Caution: When you create a custom role, you're prompted to specify Project or
Organization . You must select Organization . Project roles can't be applied
to billing accounts.
After custom roles are created, you can grant custom roles to users just like
standard, predefined roles.
Learn how to update billing permissions .
Example custom role
Imagine you want to give someone the ability to edit cost management features,
such as budget alerts and billing export. The relevant permissions are:
billing.budgets.create
billing.budgets.update
billing.accounts.updateUsageExportSpec
With the predefined roles, to apply these permissions you need to grant
the Billing Account Administrator role. But that role also includes
permission to delete resource associations, cancel subscriptions, and close the
billing account. If you didn't want your users to have those capabilities, you
could instead create a custom role
with only the three necessary permissions and name it Cost Management
Administrator . Then, you could apply that custom role in combination with the
Billing Account Viewer role to any users that should have broad cost
management permissions but no ability to edit other account properties.
Permission association and inheritance
You can grant billing permissions at the billing
account level or at the project level. Most billing permissions belong on the
billing account, so roles containing those permissions should be associated with
the billing account. Other billing permissions instead belong on a project and
need to be associated with the project instead of the billing account.
For example, associating a
project with a billing account requires the
billing.resourceAssociations.create permission on the billing account and
also the resourcemanager.projects.createBillingAssignment permission on the
project. This is because project permissions are required for actions where
project owners control access, while billing account permissions are required
for actions where billing account administrators control access. When both
are involved, both permissions are necessary.
Just like other IAM permissions, all billing permissions
inherit from higher levels of the billing hierarchy. For example, a user with
a role containing billing.accounts.close on an organization can close any
billing account within that organization. However, some permissions only apply
at higher levels. For example, the billing.accounts.list permission doesn't
do anything when applied to an individual billing account, but a user with a
role containing billing.accounts.list on an organization can list all billing
accounts within that organization.
Billing activities
The following tables describe common billing activities, the permissions
required to perform those activities, and the resource that those permissions
apply to.
Account management
Action
Permission
Resource
Get basic account information (for example, account name, currency, or if the
account is open or closed)
billing.accounts.get
Billing account
Upgrade from free trial
billing.accounts.update
Billing account
Rename account
billing.accounts.update
Billing account
Change purchase order number
billing.accounts.update
Billing account
Close account
billing.accounts.close
Billing account
Reopen closed account
billing.accounts.reopen
Billing account
Key Point: Most billing actions require
billing.accounts.get . You might consider giving a role with this
permission to all users who need billing account access.
Billing account hierarchy

Cost information
Cost view permissions can be limited to specific projects, or granted on a
billing account to view all costs for a billing account.
Action
Permission
Resource
View costs and usage for a billing account*
billing.accounts.getSpendingInformation
Billing account
View costs and usage for a project*
billing.resourceCosts.get
Project
resourcemanager.projects.get
Project
* Note: A user with
billing.accounts.getSpendingInformation permission on the billing
account can view costs for the entire billing account including all of
its projects. If you want to limit a user to viewing the costs only for
specific projects, give the user the billing.resourceCosts.get
and resourcemanager.projects.get permissions on each project
instead of setting the billing account level permission.
Payment information
The payment profile includes customer name, address, and payment method.
Action
Permission
Resource
View payment profile
billing.accounts.getPaymentInfo
Billing account
Update payment profile
billing.accounts.updatePaymentInfo
Billing account
View prices only for the SKUs that have incurred usage
billing.accounts.getPricing
Billing account

billing.accounts.getPricing
Billing account

Resource associations
Moving a project between billing accounts requires the same permissions as
removing it from the original billing account and associating it with the new
one.
Action

Key Point: A user with
billing-account-level permissions on the billing account can manage budgets for
the entire billing account, including any of its projects. If you want to
limit a user to managing budgets that are scoped only to a single project, give
the user project-level permissions on the project instead of setting
billing-account-level permissions. For more information, see
Create, edit, or delete budgets and budget alerts
