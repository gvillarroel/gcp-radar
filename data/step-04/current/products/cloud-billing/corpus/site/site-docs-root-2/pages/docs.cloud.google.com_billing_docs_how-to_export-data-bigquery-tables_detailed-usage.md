Detailed usage cost data schema
In your BigQuery dataset, your detailed Google Cloud
usage cost data is loaded into a data table named
gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID> .
When you use the detailed usage cost data in BigQuery, note
the following:
The table schema for the detailed Cloud Billing data export can
change over time, such as when new fields are added to the detailed export.
To protect your queries from future schema changes, rather than relying on
queries that directly reference the exported columns, we recommend that
you use
BigQuery views
to normalize the data so that the table presents the same schema to your
queries. Learn more about this
limitation .
When selecting or
creating a BigQuery dataset
for your detailed usage cost data , you can select any
dataset location that is supported for use with Cloud Billing
data .
When you enable the detailed usage cost data export for the first time
in Cloud Billing, if you select a dataset configured to use a
multi-region location
(EU or US), Cloud Billing data will be available retroactively from the
start of the previous month. Data is exported in chronological order. For
the initial backfill of exported data, it might take up to five days for
your retroactive Cloud Billing data to finish exporting before you start
seeing your most recent usage data.
If you enable the detailed usage cost data export and select a dataset
that's configured to use a supported
region location ,
your Cloud Billing data will be available starting from the date when
you enabled the export.
If you enabled, disabled, and subsequently re-enabled the
detailed usage cost data export, the Cloud Billing data might not be
available for the period when data export was explicitly disabled.
Learn more about the frequency of the data loads into your
BigQuery tables .
See other limitations
that might impact exporting your billing data to BigQuery,
such as datasets with customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) enabled.
Consider the additional data volume that your BigQuery
tables might need and the additional cost when enabling detailed usage
cost data instead of the standard usage cost data export. The
increased granularity of resource-level information can increase the
number of rows, which are aggregated in the standard usage cost format.
We recommend that you review
Control costs in BigQuery
for further best practices in managing your BigQuery costs.

Understand standard and detailed usage cost data
The following sections describe the standard and detailed usage cost data
exported to BigQuery.
About labels
The cost data for a specific label only shows usage from the date that the label
was applied to a resource. For example, if you add the label environment:dev
to a Compute Engine VM on January 15, 2024, any analysis for
environment:dev includes only the usage for that VM since January 15.
You might also see label data at different times for different services,
depending on when each service provides it.
Available system labels
System labels are key-value pairs for important metadata about the resource that
generated the usage. The following system labels are automatically included on
applicable usage.
Note: The first full day of data with these system labels is September 18, 2018.
system_labels.key
Example system_labels.value
Description

Differences between exported data and invoices
Google Cloud and billing-eligible products such as Google Maps Platform,
Google AI Studio, and Firebase report usage data to
Cloud Billing at varying intervals. Due to the complexity of our
billing and processing systems, you might see a delay between your use of
services, the usage charges being applied to your Google payments
accounts, and the usage and costs being available to view in the various
cost reports and dashboards.
Typically, your cost details are available within a day, but can sometimes
take more than 24 hours.
For self-serve, online accounts, it's possible that charges for some usage
might occur rapidly, such as 5 to 15 minutes after usage.
Because of this difference in timing, you might notice charges on your
Postpay or Prepay payments accounts
occur before you can view the details of those charges in a cost report
or billing dashboard. These system delays also impact budget alerts,
anomaly detection, and billing data exported to BigQuery.
At the end of a calendar month, late-reported usage might not be included on
that month's invoice and instead might roll over to the next month's invoice.
When you query your costs using timestamp fields, your returned data might pick
up late-reported usage that wasn't originally included on the invoice that was
generated for the same usage month. As a result, the Cloud Billing
data returned might not map directly to that invoice.
Timestamp fields include:
usage_start_time
usage_end_time
export_time
To return Cloud Billing data that maps directly to an invoice, query on
invoice.month
instead of timestamp fields.
Taxes
As of September 1, 2020, your usage cost data shows your tax liability for each
of your projects, instead of as a single line item. If you have queries or
visualizations that depend on tax data, you might need to update the queries to
account for these changes.
For example, for costs recorded before September 1, your usage cost data looks
similar to the following example, which shows a total tax liability of $10.
billing_account_id
project.id
cost_type
cost
123456-ABCDEF-123456
example-project
Regular
$60
123456-ABCDEF-123456
test-project
Regular
$40
123456-ABCDEF-123456
[empty]
Tax
$10
For costs recorded after September 1, the $10 is broken down to $6 for
example-project , and $4 for test-project :
billing_account_id
project.id
cost_type
cost
123456-ABCDEF-123456
example-project

example-project
Tax
$6
123456-ABCDEF-123456
test-project
Tax
$4
Note: If the tax isn't related to a project, the project columns are empty.
For example, Support costs are owned by the Cloud Billing account, and
not by a specific project. For taxes on these costs, the project columns are
empty.
Errors and adjustments
In the rare event that your Cloud Billing data contains an error or requires
an adjustment, it's appended with corrective data. These adjustments fall under
one of two categories: billing modifications or corrections.
Billing modifications
Billing modifications appear as separate line items. If you received a billing
modification, a new line item in your Cloud Billing export to
BigQuery shows the change. The adjustments shown correspond to
the invoice, credit memo, and debit memo documents available in the
Documents area of the Billing section in the Google Cloud console.
For more information on billing modifications and how they're applied, see
Understand memos and
adjustments .
Corrections
Corrections appear as new data that negates incorrect data on the source SKUs.
In some cases, new data replaces the incorrect charge. All columns in the
billing data export will match the original data, except for the following
columns:
cost
credit
usage.amount
export_time
For example, imagine that you're charged $10 for your usage of SKU A on
January 1. On your January invoice (issued in early February), you'll see a
charge of $10 for SKU A . However, on February 2, Google Cloud issued a
correction against SKU A , reducing the usage cost to $5. You'll receive two
additional line items on your February invoice (issued in early March):
-$10 for usage on January 1 (negating the original charge)
$5 for usage on January 1 (stating the intended charge)
These new items have an adjustment_info column in the billing data export. The
original January invoice, showing the overcharge, won't be adjusted. You can
verify your charges in your billing data export by viewing your costs by
usage_start_time and grouping by Day . In these views, any corrections or
charges for late-monetized usage are accumulated, and you don't need to worry
about any temporarily incorrect data.
If you want more detailed information on your corrections, view all charges in
an invoice month , and look for charges where the usage date occurred
before the invoice month. These charges are the results of corrections or
late-monetized usage.
The following code sample shows how to create a basic query that returns the
total cost of corrections or late-monetized usage:
SELECT
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount )
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))
AS total
FROM ` project . dataset . gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX - XXXXXX - XXXXXX `
WHERE
invoice . month = '202311' AND
DATE ( TIMESTAMP_TRUNC ( usage_start_time , Day , 'US/Pacific' )) < '2023-11-01' ;
For a query example that returns a cost breakdown by service , for invoice
charges, where the usage date occurred before the invoice month , see
Query cost details to view corrections or late-monetized usage by service for a
specified invoice
month
in "Example queries for Cloud Billing data export."
About promotional credits in custom pricing contracts
If you have a custom pricing contract, you might receive promotional credits to
use on Google Cloud as part of the contract. For example, you might
receive $1,000 to use on Compute Engine resources. Promotional credits
are typically considered a form of payment. When available, promotional credits
are automatically applied to reduce your total bill.
The terms of your contract specify whether the promotional credits apply to your
costs calculated at the list price of a SKU, or the net price (after
discounts).
If your promotional credits apply to costs that are calculated at the list
price , in the Cost table report, there's a service called Invoice , with a
SKU called Contract billing adjustment . This SKU adjusts your credits so that
they apply to the costs at list price. To see the usage that the adjustment is
for, query the system.labels columns. The key in system.labels.key is
cloud-invoice.googleapis.com/sku_id , and the value in system.labels.value
contains the SKU ID that the credit and the adjustment applied to.
About tags
Tags
are resources in the form of key-value pairs that can be attached to resources
directly or through inheritance. You can use tags to perform chargebacks,
audits, and other cost allocation analysis. You can also use tags and
conditional enforcement of policies for fine-grained control across your
resource hierarchy.
Tags have a robust permissions model and can support inheritance, centralized
management, nomenclature standardization, and policy engine integration, while
labels are a separate tool that allow you to annotate resources.
Tags data appears in BigQuery exports for Resources, Projects,
Folders, and Organizations.
Available tags
The Standard costs and Detailed costs exports for Resources, Projects,
Folders, and Organizations include these fields for tags data: Tags Key, Tags
Value, Tags Inherited, and Tags Namespace.
Resource-level tags in the Cloud Billing data export are available
for the following resources:
AlloyDB for PostgreSQL clusters, instances, and backups
Artifact Registry repositories
Bigtable instances
Cloud Run services and jobs
Cloud Storage buckets
Compute Engine instances
Memorystore for Redis instances
Secret Manager global and regional secrets
Spanner instances
Firestore databases
Tags limitations
Tags might take up to an hour to propagate to BigQuery
exports. If a tag has been added or removed within an hour, or if a resource
has existed for less than an hour, it might not appear in the export.
Detailed usage cost query examples
This section provides examples of how to query the Cloud Billing detailed usage cost data exported to BigQuery.
Return the resource-level costs on an invoice
Sum costs for each resource, per invoice
Return details by cost type for each resource, per invoice month
Get breakdown of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster costs
Filter GKE cost breakdown
Because the detailed usage cost schema includes all of the fields from the
standard usage cost schema, the query examples provided for the
standard data
exported to BigQuery also work with the detailed data that's
exported. The standard query examples aren't written to retrieve
any of the resource-level information that's provided with the detailed
usage cost export option. When creating queries for the detailed data, you
can use a standard query example as a template, update the Table name ,
and add any of the fields that are available in the detailed usage cost schema .
Common values used in the example detailed cost queries
The query examples in this section use the following value for Table name :
project.dataset.gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_XXXXXX_XXXXXX_XXXXXX
Return the resource-level costs on an invoice
The following queries demonstrate two ways of viewing resource-level cost and
credit values on an invoice using exported billing data.
The total field directly sums the floating point cost and credit values,
which can result in floating point rounding errors.
The total_exact field converts costs and credit values to micros before
summing, then converts back to dollars after summing, avoiding the
floating point rounding error.
Sum costs for each resource, per invoice
This query shows the invoice total for each resource.name per month, as a sum
of regular costs, taxes, adjustments, and rounding errors. Any costs not
associated with a resource-level item are aggregated under the name null
for the month.
Standard SQL
SELECT
invoice . month ,
resource . name ,
SUM ( cost )
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( c . amount )
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))
AS total ,
( SUM ( CAST ( cost * 1000000 AS int64 ))
+ SUM ( IFNULL (( SELECT SUM ( CAST ( c . amount * 1000000 as int64 ))
FROM UNNEST ( credits ) c ), 0 ))) / 1000000
AS total_exact
FROM ` project . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_XXXXXX_XXXXXX_XXXXXX `

Query using system labels
System labels for Google Cloud reservations provide enhanced visibility into
your reservation usage. They allow you to track which instances are
consuming which reservations, and analyze the costs associated with both used and
unused capacity directly within BigQuery.
These examples use two system labels:
compute.googleapis.com/reservation_name
compute.googleapis.com/reservation_project_id
These labels are present on Cloud Billing records from both instances
consuming a reservation and the unused portion of a reservation.
The following examples demonstrate how to query the BigQuery
billing export to analyze reservation consumption using system labels.
Important: These reservation labels are present in Cloud Billing export
data for usage on or after September 17, 2025. Historical data prior to this
date won't include valid labels.
Before you begin
To query using system labels, you must have Cloud Billing export to
BigQuery enabled, specifically the Detailed usage cost data
export. This export contains the resource-level information, including system
labels, necessary to see the new reservation labels.
To set up or verify your BigQuery export, see the following
documentation:
Overview of billing data export to BigQuery
Set up billing data export to BigQuery
Understand the Detailed data export schema
Ensure your BigQuery dataset is configured to receive the
detailed export . The table name will typically be in the format
gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID> .
Note: In the following examples, replace
project-ID.dataset.gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_X
with your actual BigQuery table name.
View consumption for a given instance
This query lets you check if a given instance utilized a reservation
during a particular period and, if so, which reservation it was.
SELECT
t . usage_start_time ,
sl_reservation . value AS reservation_name ,
t . sku . description AS sku_description ,
SUM ( t . usage . amount ) AS total_usage_amount
FROM
project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_X AS t
LEFT JOIN
UNNEST ( t . system_labels ) AS sl_reservation
ON sl_reservation . key = 'compute.googleapis.com/reservation_name'
WHERE
t . service . id = '6F81-5844-456A' AND DATE ( TIMESTAMP_TRUNC ( t . _PARTITIONTIME , DAY )) = '2025-09-16' AND t . sku . description LIKE '%Core%' AND
t . resource . name LIKE '%tc-billing-case1-instance-1757983787%'
GROUP BY t . usage_start_time , reservation_name , t . sku . description

Note:
SKU Filtering : Limiting the SKU to CPU cores offers clearer
resource distribution. This can be adjusted to other reserved resources,
such as RAM, LocalSSD, TPU, or GPU.
On-Demand Consumption : When both reservation_name and
reservation_project_id are null, the instance is consuming on-demand resources.
When multiple rows with differing reservation_name and reservation_project_id
correspond to a specific instance within a given timeframe, it indicates that
the instance's consumed reservation changed during that period. The usage
portion will detail the consumption.
Analyze usage distribution for a given reservation
This query helps you understand the distribution of usage for a given shared
reservation, showing how much capacity was used or unused among different
Google Cloud projects that can consume the given reservation.

Analyze Vertex AI reservation usage using BigQuery
To analyze how first-party (1P) products, such as Vertex AI, consume
your shared reservations across projects where Vertex AI
jobs are active, use the following system labels in BigQuery:
compute.googleapis.com/reservation_name
compute.googleapis.com/reservation_project_id
For more information about how to share reservations with first-party (1P)
products in Vertex AI, see the following:
Use reservations with training
Use reservations with online inference
Use reservations with Vertex AI Workbench instances
The following example queries show how to use these labels to get detailed
visibility into your reservation usage, monitor how instances consume these
reservations, and perform in-depth cost analysis.
List SKU types consuming a reservation for a 1P product in Vertex AI
If you create and share a reservation with Vertex AI for a training
job, the following query returns the list of SKU types for the current date.
SELECT DISTINCT
t . sku . description AS sku_description
FROM
project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_X AS t
LEFT JOIN
UNNEST ( t . system_labels ) AS sl_reservation
ON sl_reservation . key = 'compute.googleapis.com/reservation_name'
WHERE
TRUE
AND t . service . id = '6F81-5844-456A'
AND DATE ( t . usage_start_time ) = CURRENT_DATE ()
AND EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM UNNEST ( t . Tags ) AS tag
WHERE
tag . key = 'gcp-product'
AND tag . value = 'vertex_ai'
AND tag . inherited = TRUE
)
AND sl_reservation . value = ' RESERVATION_NAME '
AND t . resource . name IS NOT NULL
AND t . resource . name != ''
ORDER BY sku_description ASC ;
Sample results
The results show that the training job uses three SKU types within the
Vertex AI service.

Analyze reservation usage for Vertex AI in shared projects
If you use a reservation shared across multiple owner projects where
Vertex AI jobs are active, you can use the following query to analyze
and break down your usage costs by individual project.
Note: The billing account determines the BigQuery table name. For this
data to be visible, all shared projects must use the same billing account;
otherwise, the information might not appear in your results.
SELECT
t . project . id AS consumer_project_id ,
t . sku . description AS sku_description ,
t . usage . unit AS usage_unit ,
SUM ( t . usage . amount ) AS total_usage_amount
FROM
project - ID . dataset . gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_X AS t
LEFT JOIN
UNNEST ( t . system_labels ) AS sl_reservation
ON sl_reservation . key = 'compute.googleapis.com/reservation_name'
LEFT JOIN
UNNEST ( t . system_labels ) AS sl_project_id
ON sl_project_id . key = 'compute.googleapis.com/reservation_project_id'
WHERE
TRUE
AND t . service . id = '6F81-5844-456A'
AND EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM UNNEST ( t . Tags ) AS tag
WHERE
tag . key = 'gcp-product'
AND tag . value = 'vertex_ai'
AND tag . inherited = TRUE
