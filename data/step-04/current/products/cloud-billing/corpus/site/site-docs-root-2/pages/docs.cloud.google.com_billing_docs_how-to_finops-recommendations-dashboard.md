Review and apply FinOps hub Recommendations
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
With the FinOps hub Recommendations dashboard, you can access the
Recommendations list, then click any of the recommendations to view the
details of the recommendation and take action.
Permissions required to access the FinOps hub Recommendations
To access the FinOps hub and view available recommendations, the FinOps score
and CUDs optimization metrics, you need either the Billing Account
Administrator or the Billing Account Viewer role for your
Cloud Billing account.
To view the recommendation detail panels, you need the Project Viewer role for
each of the projects that you want to see recommendations for, and
recommender-specific permissions. See the
list of FinOps hub cost recommenders
for the recommenders that contribute to hub metrics. To learn how to grant
permissions to view recommendation updates, see
Recommender overview .
To access the FinOps hub and Recommendations dashboard using a custom role,
you need the following
permissions
on your Cloud Billing account:
billing.accounts.get
billing.accounts.getSpendingInformation
billing.finOpsBenchmarkInformation.get
billing.finOpsHealthInformation.get
recommender.costRecommendations.listAll
Open the Recommendations dashboard
To view the Recommendations dashboard:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the FinOps hub.
Go to FinOps hub
At the prompt, choose the Cloud Billing account for which you want to
view the FinOps hub.
In the FinOps hub , from the Potential savings/month chart, click
View all recommendations .
Explore the Recommendations dashboard
In the Recommendations dashboard, you can review all of the FinOps
recommendations, view the recommendation details, send recommendations to
others to review, and apply recommendations to optimize your cloud costs.
When you first open the Recommendations dashboard, by default, the page
shows all savings recommendations, for all services and projects, including
Savings not specific to a project .
You can use the Services and Projects dropdowns to focus the page on
a smaller set of recommendations.
The options available in the Services and Projects dropdowns are
limited to the services and projects with active recommendations .
If you select an individual service, or opt to view only some of the projects,
the values in the summary (such as Last month's realized savings or
Potential savings/month ) and the recommendations in the list update
based on the selections.
The project option of Savings not specific to a project applies to costs
and credits that are calculated at the billing account level, such as
commitment fees.
CUDs savings are calculated with costs and credits
applied at both the billing account level and the project level. If you limit
your recommendations view to Savings not specific to a project , you might
see negative amounts in the savings summary. To view the most accurate CUD
recommendations and realized CUD savings , select all projects.
Use the optimization category tabs to focus your list of recommendations to
a specific savings category, such as switching off idle resources,
right-sizing instances, or purchasing additional CUDs.
Use the filter_list
Filter feature to select list properties to narrow your results.
If you have the
Recommender Viewer role
on your Cloud Billing account, you can select a recommendation to
get further details and to apply the recommendation. Depending on the type of
recommendation, you might also need project permissions to view the details
and apply a recommendation.
