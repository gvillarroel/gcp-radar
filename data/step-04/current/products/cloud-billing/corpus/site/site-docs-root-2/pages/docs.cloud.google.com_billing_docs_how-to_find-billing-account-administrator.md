Find a Billing Account Administrator

This document describes how to identify the administrators and other principals
within your organization who have Cloud Billing account permissions.
A Billing Account Administrator role
provides full owner access to a Cloud Billing account. Billing
Account Administrators can manage payment instruments, pay bills, configure
billing data exports, view cost information, link and unlink projects, and
manage user permissions on the billing account. Also, only Billing Account
Administrators can contact Cloud Billing Support.
By default, the person who creates the Cloud Billing account is a
Billing Account Administrator for the Cloud Billing account.
Before you begin
To successfully view all the principals who have billing account permissions,
you need basic permissions on the Cloud Billing account .
Administrator-level permissions on other Google Cloud resources, such as Project
Owner, don't grant you the permissions you need to see basic billing account
information. On the Cloud Billing account, you need a role that
includes the following
permissions :
billing.accounts.get
billing.accounts.getIamPolicy
These permissions are granted in many
predefined roles for Cloud Billing ,
including:
Billing Account User
Billing Account Viewer
Billing Account Costs Manager
Billing Account Administrator
If you have some level of Cloud Billing account access, you can view
basic information about the billing account, including viewing the Info panel
to identify the administrators and other principals within your organization
who have billing account permissions.
Note: Neither the
Billing Account Creator
role (which is granted at the Organization level) nor the
Project Billing Manager
role (which is granted on a project) include the permissions
needed to access basic information about the billing account.
View permissions for a Cloud Billing account in the Info panel
In the Billing section of the Google Cloud console, the Info panel is
available on the My Billing Accounts page, and on the Account management
page. In the Info panel , you can see the list of billing administrators and
other
roles assigned on the Cloud Billing account .
View permissions on the My Billing Accounts page
You can view the Info panel on the Cloud Billing My Billing Accounts
page.
Example of the My Billing Accounts page showing the Info panel for a
selected billing account, with the Billing Account Administrator role
node expanded. The numbers in this example correspond with the following
steps.
To access the Info panel on the My Billing Accounts page and view
your Billing Account Administrators, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the My Billing Accounts page in the
Billing section.
Go to My Billing Accounts
If you have billing accounts for more than one organization, and you want
to view accounts across all of your organizations, expand the organization
selector and choose None Selected .
By default, your list of billing accounts is filtered to show only
Active accounts.
To view a complete list of your billing accounts, active and closed,
remove the Status : Active filter.
To view a list of accounts filtered by Closed accounts, remove the
Status : Active filter and add a Status : Closed filter.
Select the row of a Cloud Billing account to view the principals
and permissions for the billing account in the Info panel . If the
info panel isn't already visible, click Show info panel to open it.
Expand
( arrow_right )
the Billing Account Administrator role node to view all the
principals who are assigned as an administrator on the selected
Cloud Billing account.
View permissions on the Account management page
You can view the Info panel on the Cloud Billing Account management
page. This option works well when you want to find the billing account
administrators of a single, active billing account that you know by name.
If the billing account is closed or you're unsure of its name, locate the
billing account and its permissions on the
My Billing Account page Info panel .
Example of the Account management page showing the Info panel for a
selected billing account, with the Billing Account Administrator role
node expanded.
To access the Info panel on the Account management page and view
your Billing Account Administrators, do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Account management page for the
Cloud Billing account .
Go to Account management
At the prompt, choose the Cloud Billing account that you
want to view.
The Account management page opens for the selected
Cloud Billing account.
In the Info panel , you can review the Principals and Permissions
for the selected Cloud Billing account. If the panel isn't already
visible, click Show info panel to open it.
Expand
( arrow_right )
the Billing Account Administrator role node to view all the
principals who are assigned as an administrator on the selected
Cloud Billing account.
About permissions in the Info panel
The Permissions panel is organized by role, along with the number of
principals assigned to each role. For example, in your permissions panel, you
might see:
Billing Account Administrator (2)
Billing Account User (6)
Billing Account Viewer (10)
To view the list of principals assigned to a role, expand the
arrow_right
* role node . Principals are users, groups,
domains, or service accounts. The same principal can be assigned to multiple
roles.
To find a specific principal and see which roles are granted to that
principal, use the
filter_list Filter and enter the email address of the principal.

What to do if you have no billing account access
If you don't have permissions to access the Cloud Billing account, and
you need to locate your Billing Account Administrator, try the following
options:
Recommended : Locate someone at your company or organization who has some
level of permissions to access the Cloud Billing account and ask
them to look up the billing account administrators. For example, people who
work on finance or accounting teams will typically have access to the
Cloud Billing account.
If all else fails : If you have no way to know who your Billing Account
Administrators are and you (or your organization) have lost access to your
Cloud Billing account and you need to regain access, you can contact
Cloud Billing Support using the account recovery form .
For the team of specialists to provide assistance, you must
meet all of the requirements specified on the form and submit all information
requested. This includes providing the
billing account ID
and explaining how or why you lost access to the Cloud Billing
account.
