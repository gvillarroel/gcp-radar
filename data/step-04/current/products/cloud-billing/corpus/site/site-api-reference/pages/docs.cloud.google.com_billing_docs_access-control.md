Access control for Cloud Billing APIs
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Google Cloud offers
Identity and Access Management (IAM) ,
which lets you give access to specific Google Cloud resources but not
others. IAM lets you adopt the security principle of least
privilege, so you grant only the necessary access to your resources.
IAM lets you control who (users) has what access (roles)
to which resources by setting IAM allow policies. Allow
policies grant specific roles to a user, providing the user all of the
permissions in those roles.
This page explains the IAM roles that are available for the
Cloud Billing APIs. For example, you can use IAM to grant roles
such as Billing Account Costs Manager or Billing Account Viewer on a
Cloud Billing account. For a detailed description of IAM and
its features, see the
IAM
documentation . In particular, see
Manage
access to projects, folders, and organizations and
Manage
access to other resources .
Permissions and roles
For a user to view Cloud Billing account details in the
Google Cloud console, or for a Cloud Billing API method to return
Cloud Billing account information, the user or caller must have the
necessary permissions.
Required permissions for the Cloud Billing Catalog API
No permissions are required to use the Cloud Billing Catalog API (Services list and SKUs
list). All of the data that this API returns is public.
Required permissions for the Cloud Billing Budget API
The following table outlines which permissions are necessary to call each
Cloud Billing Budget API method. Also included are the standard IAM
Billing roles that automatically grant those permissions.
API Method
Required Permission
IAM Role that grants permissions
GetBudget
To get the details of a budget, the caller must have the
billing.budgets.get permission on the budget's
Cloud Billing account.
For single-project budgets, instead of billing account permissions, the
caller can have the following permissions on the project:
resourcemanager.projects.get and
billing.resourcebudgets.read .
Billing Account Administrator, Billing Account Costs Manager, or
Billing Account Viewer on the budget's Cloud Billing account.
For single-project budgets, Project Owner, Project Editor, or Project
Viewer on the project.
ListBudgets
To return a list of budgets applied to a Cloud Billing account,
the caller must have the billing.budgets.list permission
on the Cloud Billing account.

caller can have the following permissions on the project:
resourcemanager.projects.get and
billing.resourcebudgets.read .
Billing Account Administrator, Billing Account Costs Manager, or
Billing Account Viewer on the budget's Cloud Billing account.
For single-project budgets, Project Owner, Project Editor, or Project
Viewer on the project.
CreateBudget
To create a new budget, the caller must have the
billing.budgets.create permission on the budget's
Cloud Billing account.
For single-project budgets, instead of billing account permissions, the
caller can have the following permissions on the project:
resourcemanager.projects.get ,
billing.resourcebudgets.read , and
billing.resourcebudgets.write .
Billing Account Administrator or Billing Account Costs Manager on
the budget's Cloud Billing account.
For single-project budgets, Project Owner or Project Editor on the
project.
UpdateBudget
To update an existing budget, the caller must have the
billing.budgets.update permission on the budget's
Cloud Billing account.
For single-project budgets, instead of billing account permissions, the
caller can have the following permissions on the project:
resourcemanager.projects.get ,
billing.resourcebudgets.read , and
billing.resourcebudgets.write .
Billing Account Administrator or Billing Account Costs Manager on
the budget's Cloud Billing account.
For single-project budgets, Project Owner or Project Editor on the
project.
DeleteBudget
To delete an existing budget, the caller must have the
billing.budgets.delete permission on the budget's
Cloud Billing account.
For single-project budgets, instead of billing account permissions, the
caller can have the following permissions on the project:
resourcemanager.projects.get ,

billing.resourcebudgets.write .
Billing Account Administrator or Billing Account Costs Manager on
the budget's Cloud Billing account.
For single-project budgets, Project Owner or Project Editor on the
project.
Required permissions for the Cloud Billing Account API
The following table lists the required permissions to call each
Cloud Billing Account API method, as well as the IAM roles for
Cloud Billing that include those permissions.
API method
Required permissions

Cloud Billing account.

permission to access.

Roles
You don't directly give users permissions; instead, you grant them
roles , which have one or more permissions bundled within them.
You can grant one or more roles on the same resource.
The following table lists the IAM roles that you can grant to
access the Cloud Billing APIs, the description of what the role does, and the
permissions bundled within that role. Some of these roles also include
permissions for other Google Cloud services.
To grant permissions to the Cloud Billing APIs, you
set up a service account for the API, and assign roles to the service account.
