Session data feed
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A session data feed captures the stream of data that is generated when events
take place during a session. These events are actions taken by agents,
end-users, and Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform). You can analyze session data feeds to get
insights into user experience, customer engagement, agent
performance, and more.
The Session Data Feed widget is available when you create a desktop
layout , so you can include a panel in
your desktop layouts that contains the session data feed. As your session
progresses, the session data feed captures event data and displays it in the
panel. To save session data feeds without a CRM, you need to configure External
storage .
Turn on the session data feed
To use the session data feed, you need to turn it on.
To turn on the session data feed, follow these steps:
In the CCAI Platform portal, click Settings > Operation
Management . If you don't see the Settings menu, click menu Menu .
Go to the Agent Desktop pane.
For Session Data Feed , select the Use session data feed checkbox.
Click Save Agent Desktop .
