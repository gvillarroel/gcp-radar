Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to create an instance of CCAI Platform.
Before you begin
To use CCAI Platform, do the following:
Use a full WebRTC browser . You need the most up-to-date version of a full
WebRTC browser. CCAI Platform supports Chrome, Safari, and Firefox,
but we recommend the most recent version of Chrome.
Allow CCAI Platform notifications, permissions and cookies . For
more information, see Granting Notification and Microphone
Permissions. .
Confirm proper network configuration . Firewalls can potentially
block incoming support inquiries and other critical capabilities.
Get quota . For more information, see Instance size and quota .
Instance size and quota
The following table shows CCAI Platform instance sizes and the
maximum number of concurrent call or chat sessions.
Instance size
Concurrent sessions
Small
250. Note : The minimum size for a small instance is 25 agents.
Medium
1600
Large
3800
X-Large
14,000
2X-Large
38,000
3X-Large
100,000
There are also non-production instances that you can use for trials,
development, or demonstrations. Each of these trial instance has a maximum of
250 concurrent sessions. You can use trial instances without being charged for
them. Here are the non-production instances that are available:
Trial Small : an instance for performing a trial
Sandbox Small : an instance for Google partners to perform customer
demonstrations and testing
Dev Small : an instance for development or user-acceptance testing
Time-Limited Trial Small : an instance for performing a trial. This
instance has an end date.
Important: Non-production instances are provided at no charge with the exception
of telephony. Telephony costs are billed monthly to the billing account
associated with the Google Cloud project.
Google does not permit non-production instances to be used for production
traffic. Any production usage on a non-production instance will result in
either the instance being stopped or the instance being converted to a
production instance, with usage being billed to your account.
Note: Instances of any size or type can only be created after quota has been granted
by Google. If the Create button is disabled, this is likely due to no quota
having been granted. To get quota granted to your instance, contact your
Google Cloud account team or a Google Cloud
Partner .
Billing model
Instances are billed monthly. Billing depending on which of the following
charging models is assigned to your instance:
Concurrent agents : the maximum number of concurrent users with the agent role
that are signed in during the month period
Named agents : the maximum number of users in the instance that have the
agent role during the month period
Minutes used : the number of minutes that users with the agent role are
signed in during the month period
Note: Telephony charges are charged according to consumption.
Set up your Google Cloud project for CCAI Platform

Working from home
Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform) is the perfect tool to empower agents to work from home.
By following a few guidelines outlined in the following sections, agents will be
up and running in no time from the safety of their own homes.
Ideally, agents will be using the same laptops that they used in the
office which retain control over allow-listing or deny listing and
applications the device uses such as AdBlock, mic permissions, etc. If
agents don't have access to a work laptop, it's possible for them to use
their personal computers if they follow the best practices outlined
in the following sections.
Network requirements
The following sections outline the specific network requirements to support an
optional agent and customer experience.
Bandwidth
We recommend that you have the bandwidth for 2 Mbps upload and 2
Mbps download per agent . At a minimum, you should have at least 1
Mbps of network bandwidth per agent.
If agents are sharing an internet connection with roommates or
family members, agents need to work to prevent others from streaming
or downloading large files during working hours.
Firewalls
Make sure home firewalls don't block access to the Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform)
application.
If agents have customized security or firewalls setup with IP allow-listing
(as opposed to deny-listing), configuration of the router and possibly your
firewall is needed to allow Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform) IP addresses.
See IP address
allow listing
for a list of URLs and IP addresses.
Workstation requirements
The following section outlines the requirements for the agent workstation.
Programs & physical requirements
Agents should use a hard-wired connection as Wi-Fi connectivity cannot
guarantee the support of proper voice quality.
Running any network or CPU intensive applications on the same computer, like
streaming music or large uploads/downloads, will compete with bandwidth for
audio from Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform) and is highly discouraged.
Agent computers should have a Core i5 hardware processor or higher. The
recommended RAM is at least 8 GBs.
Make sure the most recent version of Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform) supported browser
has been installed and browser notifications have been enabled for
Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform). We support Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, but recommend
the most recent version of Chrome.
Disable any 3rd party browser extensions that may block 3rd party
integrations. Examples are: AdBlock, Ghostery, AdBlock Plus, etc.
Supported browsers
Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform) is supported by the latest version of Google Chrome.
Refer to the Google Chrome update
page
for more information.
Headsets
Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform) customers have been most successful with the following
standards for headsets. Headsets should have a wired connection to the
computer. Wireless headsets suffer from signal congestion, delay, and can run
out of battery power, possibly during a call.
Recommended headset features
Binaural - Audio in both ears cuts down on background noise
Noise-canceling microphone
Noise-canceling headset
USB connection
Brands of headsets our customers use
Jabra
Logitech
Plantronics
Sennheiser
