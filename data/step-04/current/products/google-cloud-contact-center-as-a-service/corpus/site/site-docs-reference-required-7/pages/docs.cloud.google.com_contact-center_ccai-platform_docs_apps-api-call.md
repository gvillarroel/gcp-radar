Call endpoints
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The call API endpoints provide access to the call objects. A call object is
created for every call that is made to and from
Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform).
The following are the call API endpoints:
Outbound call - end_user_number
Outbound call - ticket_id
Incoming call
Scheduled call
Update reserved data attributes during a call
Get reserved data attributes during a call
Pass data parameters to virtual agents mid-session
