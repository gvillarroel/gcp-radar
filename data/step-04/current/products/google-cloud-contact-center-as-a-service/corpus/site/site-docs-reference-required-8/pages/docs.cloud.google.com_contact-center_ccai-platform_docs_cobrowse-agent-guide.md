Use Screen Share
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to use Screen Share, which enables screen sharing with an
end-user (consumer). Optionally, it enables remote control of the end-user's
device. You can initiate a Screen Share session during an active web or mobile chat
session using the Smart Actions menu in the agent adapter.
Screen Share modes
Screen Share has three modes, with each mode giving you a different level of
control over the end-user's device. Each time you initiate a different Screen Share
mode, a message is sent to the end-user that describes the requested level of
access and gives them the opportunity to approve or deny access.
Here are the three Screen Share modes:
Screen Share mode . You can view, but not control, the
end-user's screen.
Remote control mode . You can view and control the
end-user's screen.
Full device mode . You can view the end-user's active
screen. If the end-user moves to another screen, your view changes to that
screen. You can't control the end-user's screens.
Note: By default all modes are enabled when Screen Share is enabled, however
depending on the business needs you may find only certain modes are enabled.
Screen Share mode
With Screen Share mode, you can view, but not control, the end-user's screen.
Every Screen Share session starts in Screen Share mode. In Screen Share mode,
behavior varies slightly depending on whether you're using the web channel or
the mobile channel. The following list explains the difference:
Web channel: With Screen Share mode using the web channel, you can see
the end-user's active browser tab.
Mobile channel: With Screen Share mode using the mobile channel, you can
see the end-user's active screen within the app. If the end-user minimizes
the app, their screen isn't visible to you until they reopen the app.
To initiate a Screen Share session during an active chat session, do the
following:
In the agent adapter, click Smart Actions > Request
Screen Share . A message is sent to the end-user requesting consent to share
their screen. If the end-user clicks Allow , you receive a notification
with a View button.
Click View to start the Screen Share session.
Optional: Click the laser pointer icon to point on the end-user's screen.
Optional: Click edit Pencil to draw
on the end-user's screen.
Optional: Click delete Trash to
erase your drawings.
Remote control mode
With remote control mode, you can view and control the end-user's screen. You
need to have an active Screen Share session before you can enter remote control
mode. In remote control mode, behavior varies slightly depending on whether
you're using the web channel or the mobile channel. The following list explains
the difference:
Web channel . With remote control mode using the web channel, you
can control mouse and keyboard actions on the end-user's active browser tab.
Mobile channel . With remote control mode using the mobile channel, you
can control mouse and keyboard actions on the end-user's active screen
within the app. If the end-user minimizes the app, their screen isn't
visible to you until they reopen the app.
To enter remote control mode from Screen Share mode, follow these steps:
Start with an active Screen Share session in Screen Share mode. For information
about initiating a Screen Share session, see Screen Share
mode .
In the agent adapter, click pan_tool_alt
Remote control . A message is sent to the end-user requesting consent for
the agent to take control of their screen. If the end-user clicks Allow ,
the Screen Share session enters remote control mode.
Full device mode
With full device mode, you can view the end-user's active screen. If the
end-user moves to another screen, your view changes to that screen. You can't
control the end-user's screens. In full device mode, behavior varies slightly
depending on whether you're using the web channel or the mobile channel. The
following list explains the difference:
Web channel . With full device mode using the web channel, you can see
whichever browser tab that the end-user makes active.
Mobile channel . With full device mode using the mobile channel, you can
see the end-user's active screen within the app. If the end-user minimizes
the app, their screen remains visible.
To enter full device mode from Screen Share mode or remote control mode, follow
these steps:
Start with an active Screen Share session. The active session can be in either
Screen Share mode or remote control
mode .
In the agent adapter, click the Full device toggle to the on position. A
message is sent to the end-user requesting consent to share their full
screen with the agent. If the end-user clicks Allow , the Screen Share
session enters full device mode. If you were previously in remote control
mode, remote control is automatically disabled.
Request a Screen Share session: All call types
During a session, the agent can request the consumer to obtain the six-digit
access code needed to initiate the Screen Share session. The six-digit access code
should be generated on your website.
Click Actions > Enter Screen Share code on the agent adapter.
Enter the six-digit code provided by the consumer.
Note: The code must be six digits and numeric, and cannot be reused. After
the Screen Share session has been used, a new code must be generated. If the
code is incorrectly entered, or contains non-numeric characters, an error
message will appear, stating "Code must consist of six digits".
Click start session .
The consumer must allow access before the Screen Share session begins. Once
allowed, a new window will open, showing the consumer's screen.
End a Screen Share session
The Screen Share session can be ended at any time by the agent or the consumer.
Before a session is ended a confirmation message "End Co-browsing - Would you like to end the session?" will allow the consumer or agent to click yes or no .
