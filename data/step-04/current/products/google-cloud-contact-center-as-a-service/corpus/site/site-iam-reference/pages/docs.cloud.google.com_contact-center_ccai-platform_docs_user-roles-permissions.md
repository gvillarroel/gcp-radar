User roles and permissions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Users of Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform) are allocated roles. The roles
determine the permissions that a user has and what they can do
in the CCAI Platform portal.
Roles in CCAI Platform are either default roles or custom roles.
Default user roles and permissions
Within CCAI Platform there are 6 predefined roles that have assigned
permission sets. These roles define the configuration, monitoring, and reporting
available to the user. A user can be assigned one or a combination of
multiple roles.
Beyond these 6 roles, any combination of permission sets can be
configured for custom roles. For more information see
Custom roles & permissions .
Role details
Agent and Admin roles each have fixed permissions sets, whereas manager roles
have fixed permission sets but the content varies based on who the user manages.
Users with manager roles must be assigned as team managers in the
CCAI Platform portal by going to Settings > Users & Team to be able to see
configuration and monitoring data about agents.
Agent
The agent role is the only role that can access the CCAI Platform agent adapter.

Don't see a role you want? Create your on custom role:
Custom roles & permissions .
Custom roles and permissions
In addition to the 6 default user roles (Admin, Manager,
Manager Data, Manager Teams, Manager Admin, Agent), with custom roles &
permissions, you can create custom roles with unique sets of permissions
assigned. This gives flexibility in deciding which users (or groups of users)
have access to specific sections of the Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform) portal, features,
and the agent adapter.
You can grant users access to any page contained in the CCAI Platform portal,
including the dashboards and settings pages. Permissions for users can be edit,
view-only, or restricted to data relevant to the team that they are assigned to.
Agents
An agent is a user that is assigned the agent role. Only an agent can answer a
call or a chat. You can assign the agent role to a user when you add a
user , or by editing an existing user .
For an agent to be able to answer a call or a chat, you must either: (1) Assign
the agent directly to a queue, or (2) Assign the agent to a team that is
assigned to a queue. For more information, see Add and configure
teams and
Queue and menu setup .
Feature specifics
The following sections provide overview of the specific features.
What are permissions?
The ability to perform actions within the CCAI Platform portal (including viewing
content, editing content, and changing configuration) is governed by
permissions. Each individual permission has a name (such as Settings -
Users & Teams - Edit User ) and covers one action or a small subset of
actions. A user must be granted permission in order to do the
corresponding action; permissions are defined by the pages and features
that provide the actions.
What are roles?
Rather than assigning individual permissions directly to each user, permissions
are grouped into roles. You can define one or more roles in your
Contact Center AI Platform environment, and then grant permissions to each role.
Each user must be given a role upon creation, and may optionally be
assigned up to 9 more additional roles. It is a good practice to create several
roles in within your CCAI Platform environment.
General points about roles
There is a maximum of 100 custom roles per CCAI Platform instance.
There is a maximum of 10 roles per user.
When multiple roles are assigned to a user, the highest level of permissions
will be granted.
When a user doesn't have view or edit access to a page, they won't see the
associated section of the CCAI Platform portal.
Default roles
Default roles cannot be edited or renamed. If you want to adjust the permissions
in a role, you can create a new role with the necessary permissions.
Types of permissions
The following sections outline the types of permissions.
View versus edit permissions
For many permissions, you can specify view or edit access.
View : Allows the user to view the page.
Edit : Always grants view access and allows the user to make
changes on the page.
Assigned team only
Some permissions have an assigned teams only option associated with it. When
selected, users assigned this role will only be able to access information
relevant to the teams they have been assigned to. Refer to Add and configure
teams for
more information.
This setting is specific to an individual permissions. A user may be given
access to assigned teams only for one page permission, but be given access to
all for another.
Assigned queues only
Dashboard permissions have an assigned queues only option associated. When
selected, users assigned this role will only be able to access information
relevant to the selected queues that their team has been assigned to.
This setting is specific to individual permissions. A user may be given access
to assigned queues only for one page, but be given access to all data for
another.
Assignable roles
Limit which roles a user can assign to other users using the assignable
roles feature. An example use case would be to only allow a Supervisor to
assign the agent role and ensure no new users are assigned the Admin role by
the supervisor.
To assign the role:
In the CCAI Platform portal, go to Settings > Users & Teams > Edit
User .
Click Assignable roles .
Select the roles you want the current role to be able to assign to other
users.
License types
Within CCAI Platform there are various user license types for billing
purposes which include agent, Screen Share agent, manager, and administrator. The
following list provides the definitions for which user permissions constitute
which type of license. Any custom role that is created will be assigned a
license type.
The license type definitions will be the following:
Admin : A user with one or more administrator permissions.
Manager : A user with one or more manager permissions, but no
'Admin' permissions.
Agent : A user with only agent permissions.
Screen Share agent : A user with only agent permissions and Screen Share
permissions.
If a user is assigned multiple different roles that fall into different license
type categories, then the highest impact license type is assigned to the user.
The impact order is: Admin > Manager > Screen Share agent > Agent.
In the following table is a breakdown of which permissions are associated
with which license type.
CCAI Platform portal configuration

custom roles.
