Wrap-up] / [Total time agent status = Available]
Volume per Hour : Average volume of interactions per hour (per hour
referenced as 24 hours in a day, regardless of hours of operation)
Handle Time:
Calls: average (call duration + hold time + default wrap-up status
associated with a Call ID)
Chats: average chat duration only (no wrap-up status applied)
Longest Handle Time : Longest call/chat duration
Calls: max(call duration + average default wrap-up status associated
with an interaction ID)
Chats: max chat duration only (no wrap-up status applied)
Hold Time : Average duration (in seconds) that a consumer was placed
on hold by an Agent.
Longest Hold Time : Max duration (in seconds) that a consumer was
placed on hold by an Agent
Wait Time : Average time a consumer spends in the queue.
Average(Connected [to agent] DateTime - Call Queued DateTime)
Longest Wait Time : Max time a consumer spends in the queue.
Max(Connected [to agent] DateTime - Call Queued DateTime)

SDK.
Lowest CSAT Rating : Lowest CSAT given by a consumer via IVR, Mobile
