Hours of operation
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform) lets you configure hours of operation for
the contact center and specific holiday hours per queue. With holiday hours, you
have the flexibility to create and manage your own set of holidays with complete
control over the holiday name, dates, and time. To make holiday management even
easier, you can group your holidays together by creating folders.
Permissions
Of the default permissions, only the Admin permission permits the creation or
editing of holidays.
Custom roles can also obtain this permission by being granted the Edit
permission for the Support Center Details page.
Create folders and holidays

folder named "Company Holidays" could include all holidays recognized by the

where the company operates.

Hours of operation queue hierarchy
If any leaf queue is open, or if any leaf queue has custom after hour deflection
selected, options are provided at the parent level and the deflection follows
the custom option or the global option depending on what is configured. If all
sub queues and parent queues are closed, parent-queue after-hour deflection is
followed. Here are some examples:
If the parent queue is closed, leaf queue 1 is open, and leaf queue 2 is
closed, then parent-queue after-hour deflection is ignored and leaf queue
options are provided. If the open leaf queue option is selected, the
interaction routes to an agent. If the closed leaf queue is selected, the
interaction follows either the global after-hour deflection or the queue
deflection, depending on what is configured.
If the parent queue is closed and all leaf queues are closed with no queue
level after hour deflection enabled, then the parent-queue after-hour
deflection is followed.
If the parent queue is closed and all the leaf queues are
closed and have their own after-hour deflection, then the parent-queue
after-hour deflection is ignored and options are presented following the
after-hour deflection of whichever queue option was selected.
If the parent queue is open and all leaf queues are closed
without any queue-level after-hour deflection, the interaction follows
parent-level after-hour deflection.
If the parent queue is open and some leaf queues are open, then all
queue options are provided with the open options routing to an agent
and the closed queues following the after-hour deflection, whether global
or queue level is configured.
