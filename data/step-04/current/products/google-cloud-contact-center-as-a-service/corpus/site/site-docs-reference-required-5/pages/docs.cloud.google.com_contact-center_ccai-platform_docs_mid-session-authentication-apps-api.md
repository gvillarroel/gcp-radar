Mid-Session authentication by API
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to use call and chat API endpoints for mid-session
authentication in your SDK channels.
Users can start a support session, such as a support chat, without authenticating.
When end-user authentication becomes necessary, you can initiate an authentication
flow. Upon successful authentication, you can update the end_user identifier to link
the session to the verified end-user.
URI and authentication
The base URI for this new endpoint differs depending on the comm_type .
For the call comm_type:
POST https://&lt;subdomain>.&lt;domain>//apps/api/v1/calls/:call_id/end_user
For the chat comm_type:
POST https://&lt;subdomain>.&lt;domain>//apps/api/v1/chats/:chat_id/end_user
