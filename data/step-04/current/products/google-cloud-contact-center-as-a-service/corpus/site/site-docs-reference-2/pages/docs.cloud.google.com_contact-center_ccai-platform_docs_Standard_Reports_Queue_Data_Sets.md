Queue Summary - All Interactions Report
The Queue Summary - All Interactions report provides a summary
including all interactions, including transfers to the same or different
queues. This includes: the first time that the interaction entered a
queue, and subsequent entries to a queue after the work was accepted by
an agent. This report displays the number of queue interactions by queue
for each day. For the queue interactions for each date, the report
provides a breakdown of how the interactions exited the queue.
The Queue Summary - All Interactions report can be found at
Reports > Queues .
The metrics included in this report are as follows:
Metric Name
Definition
Queue Name
The name of the queue including the full path names if the queue
is a sub queue.
Queue Interactions
The number of times that an interaction entered a queue. This
includes: the first time that the interaction entered a queue, and
subsequent entries to a queue after the work was accepted by an
agent.
Queue Abandons
The total number of calls that were disconnected by the caller
before being accepted by an agent.
Avg Queue Abandon Time
The average time from when an interaction enters a queue but
disconnects by the caller before the interaction is accepted by an
agent
Queue Abandon Rate %
The total queue abandons as a percentage of the total queue
entries for the given period. Short abandons are included. Failed calls
are not treated as abandoned.
Short Abandons
Short abandons are interactions that have entered a queue but are
disconnected by the caller before a set number of seconds as configured
by the customer.
Long Abandons
Long abandons are interactions that have entered a queue but are
terminated by the customer after a set number of seconds as configured
by the customer.
Avg Speed of Answer (ASA)
Average time that elapsed between when an interaction entered a
queue and when it was assigned to an agent. (Avg Queue Time)
Max Speed to Answer
The maximum time that elapsed from when an interaction entered a
queue and when it was assigned to an agent. (Also known as Max Queue
Time)
SLA %
Out of all the interactions that entered the queue, the
percentage of interactions that started an active conversation with an
agent within the configured SLA threshold. If short abandons are
excluded in your SLA configuration, interactions that abandon within the
configuration abandon threshold aren't counted.
Calculation: Count of calls In SLA / (Count of calls In SLA + count
of calls Out SLA)
Count In SLA = Count of calls where queued time is less than the SLA
threshold
Count Out SLA = count of calls where queued time is equal to or
greater than the SLA threshold
Handled
The sum of interactions that were handled.
Avg Talk Time
The average length of time that the agent spent talking to a
consumer. This metric doesn't include hold time or wrap-up
time.
Avg Hold Time
The average time across all interactions where a consumer was
placed on hold.
Avg Wrap Up Time
The average amount of time that an agent was logged in and was in
wrap-up status
Avg Handle Time
The average time across all handled interactions that elapsed
from when an agent accepts an interaction to when they end their wrap-up
phase. This is calculated as Talk Time + Hold time + Wrap-up time /
All handled interactions
Failed Calls
The total number of failed calls for the given date
range.
Avg CSAT Score
The average satisfaction scores given by customers to rate the
interaction as a percentage of the total possible score.
All Queued Interactions Report
All Queued Interactions Report
Overview
The All Queued Interactions report provides detailed metrics of all
interactions that queued. This report provides insights to configured
SLAs including thresholds and service level event status. This report
does include transfer details, specifically cold transfer, where a
transfer occurs without prior notification to its recipient. This report
does not include any handled metrics.
The All Queued Interactions Report can be found at Reports >
Queues .
The metrics included in this report are as follows:
Metric name
Definition
Queue
The name of the queue including the full path names if the queue
is a sub queue - where the interaction waited.
Started At
The timestamp (date and time) when the interaction
started.
Ended At
The timestamp of when the interaction finished.
Queue Time
The time from when an interaction enters a queue until it is
either answered or the caller abandons.
Agent Name
The identity of the individual that handled the
interaction.
Agent ID
The Contact Center AI Platform (CCAI Platform) unique ID of the individual that handled the
interaction.
Agent Email
The email address of the individual that handled the
interaction
Lang
The language associated with the queue the call was routed
through.
Transfer
Identifies whether the interaction was transferred.
Service Level Event
The outcome of the interaction as per the configured SLA.
3 possible values:
In SLA: (the interaction was handled within the SLA as configured for
the queue)
Not in SLA: (the interaction was handled outside of the SLA as
configured for the queue)
Excluded: (The interaction was not considered as part of the SLA as
per the queue configuration.)
Service Level Target Time
The time target for the SLA as per the queue configuration
threshold.
Service Level Abandon Time Threshold
The Service Level Abandon threshold as configured for the
queue.
Interaction Type
The source of where the interaction originated. Possible values
include:
IVR Call
Incoming call
Numbered Incoming Call
Cold Transfer
An interaction where a transfer occurs without prior notification
to its recipient.
Returns (1) if a transfer is completed as cold, as opposed to
warm.
Event Status
The outcome of the Interaction. Possible values are:
All finished
ACW Ended
Interaction ID
The unique identifier of the interaction.
Queue Summary - Distinct Interactions Report
Queue Summary - Distinct Interactions Report
Overview
The Queue Summary - Distinct Interactions report provides a summary
of all distinct queued interactions. Distinct queued interactions (the
metric Queue Entries ) only counts the first queue entry for the
interaction. If a call is transferred to a second queue, only one queue
entry is counted for the interaction. This does not include any
transfers. This report provides insights to configured SLAs including
all handled and abandoned metrics. This report can be used to reflect on
the distinct count of contacts into your business.
This Queue Summary - Distinct Interactions report displays the number of
queue entries by queue for each day. For the queue entries for each
date, the report provides a breakdown of how those interactions exited
the queue.
The Queue Summary - Distinct Interactions report can be found in the
CCAI Platform portal at Reports > Queues .
The metrics included in this data set are as follows:
Metric Name
Definition
Queue Name
The name of the queue including the full path names if the queue
is a sub queue - where the interaction waited.
Queue Entries
This only counts the first queue entry for the interaction. If a
call is transferred to a second queue, only one queue entry is counted
for the interaction.
Queue Abandons
The total number of calls that were disconnected by the caller
without being accepted by an agent.
Avg. Queue Abandon Time
The average time from when an interaction enters a queue but
disconnects by the caller before the interaction is accepted by an
agent
Queue Abandon Rate %
The total queue abandons as a percentage of the total queue
entries for the given period. Short abandons are included. Failed calls
are not treated as abandoned.
Short Abandons
Short abandons are interactions that have entered a queue but are
disconnected by the consumer before a set number of seconds as
configured by the customer.
Long Abandons
Long abandons are interactions that have entered a queue but are
terminated by the consumer after a set number of seconds as configured
by the customer.
Avg. Speed of Answer (ASA)
Average Speed of Answer (ASA) is the average time an interaction
remains in the queue until it is assigned to an agent. ASA is only
measured in instances where the interaction is ultimately handled by an
agent.
Max. Speed of Answer
The maximum time that elapsed from when an interaction entered a
queue and when it got assigned to an agent. ASA is only measured in
instances where the call is ultimately handled by an agent.
SLA %
Out of all the interactions that entered the queue, the
percentage of interactions that started an active conversation with an
agent within the configured SLA threshold. If short abandons are
excluded in your SLA configuration, interactions that abandon within the
configuration abandon threshold aren't counted.
Calculation: Count of calls In SLA / (Count of calls In SLA + count
of calls Out SLA)
Count In SLA = Count of calls where queued time is less than the SLA
threshold
Count Out SLA = count of calls where queued time is equal to or
greater than the SLA threshold
Handled
The sum of interactions that were handled.
Avg. Talk Time
The average length of time that the agent spent talking to a
customer. This metric doesn't include hold time or wrap-up
time.
Avg. Hold Time
The average time across all interactions where a customer was
placed on hold.
Avg. Wrap-Up Time
The average amount of time that an agent was logged in and was in
the wrap-up state
Avg Handle Time (AHT)
The average time across all handled interactions that elapsed
from when an agent accepts an interaction to when they end their wrap-up
phase. This is calculated as Talk Time + Hold time + Wrap-up time /
All handled interactions
Failed Calls
The total number of failed calls for the given date
range.
Avg. CSAT Score
The average satisfaction scores given by customers to rate the
interaction as a percentage of the total possible score.
