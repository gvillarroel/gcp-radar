Work with participants
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This guide explains how to get details about participants who attended a past
conference or who are in an active conference, along with their session info,
using the Google Meet REST API.
A participant is a person
joined to a call or that uses Companion
mode , watching as a viewer, or
a room device connected to a call. There's one
participants
resource for each person.
A participant session
is a unique session ID created for each participant-device pair that joins a
call. There's one
participantSessions
resource for each session. If the participant joins the same call multiple times
from the same participant-device pair, they're each assigned unique session IDs.
If you're a meeting space owner or participant, you can call the get and
list methods on both the participants and the participantSessions
resources to retrieve participant records.
Authenticating and authorizing with user
credentials lets
Google Meet apps access user data and perform operations on the authenticated
user's behalf. Authenticating with domain-wide
delegation
lets you authorize an application's service account to access your users' data
without requiring each user to give consent.
Participants
The following sections detail how to get information about participants in a
conference record.
The
participants
resource unions with the user field. A user can be only one of the following
objects:
A signedinUser
is either:
An individual joining from a personal computer, a mobile device, or
through Companion mode.
A robot account used by conference room devices.
An
anonymousUser
is an unidentified user who's not signed in to a Google Account.
A
phoneUser
is a user dialing in from a phone where the user's identity is unknown
because they haven't signed in with a Google Account.
Note that while all three objects return a displayName , signedinUser also
returns a unique user ID that's interoperable with the Admin SDK API and the
People API. Format: users/{user} . For more information on using the user
ID with the People API, see Retrieve participant details with the
People API .
Get details about a participant
To get details about a specific participant, use the
get
method on the
participants
resource. Set the name path parameter using the format
conferenceRecords/{conferenceRecord}/participants/{participantRecord} .
If you don't know the participant name, you can list all participant
names using the list method.
The method returns a participant data as an instance of a participants
resource.
The following code sample shows how to retrieve a specific participant:

curl -X GET "https://meet.googleapis.com/v2/conferenceRecords/ CONFERENCE_RECORD_NAME /participants/ PARTICIPANT_NAME " \

Replace ACCESS_TOKEN with the access token that grants access to the API.

The conference record name with the name of the specific conference ID in a
conference record.
The participant name with the name of the specific participant ID in a
conference record.
List all participants
To list details about all participants in a conference record, use the
list
method on the
participants
resource. Set the parent path parameter using the format
conferenceRecords/{conferenceRecord} .
The method returns a list of conference participants, ordered by
earliestStartTime in descending order, as an instance of a participants
resource. To adjust the page size and filter the query results, see Customize
pagination or filter the participants list .

cURL
curl -X GET "https://meet.googleapis.com/v2/conferenceRecords/ PARENT_NAME /participants" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN "
Replace ACCESS_TOKEN with the access token that grants access to the API.
Replace the parent name with the name of the specific conference ID in a
conference record.
Customize pagination or filter the participants list
Pass the following query parameters to customize pagination of, or filter,
participants:
pageSize : The maximum number of participants to return. The service might
return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 100 participants are
returned. The maximum value is 250; values more than 250 are automatically
changed to 250.
pageToken : A page token, received from a previous list call. Provide this
token to retrieve the subsequent page.
filter : Optional. A query filter to retrieve specific items in the
participants resource results.
You can use the earliestStartTime or latestEndTime fields to filter for
users who joined before or left after a certain time. Both fields use the
Timestamp
format in RFC 3339 UTC "Zulu"
format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits:
{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z . For example:
earliestStartTime < 2023-10-01T15:01:23Z
latestEndTime < 2023-10-01T15:01:23Z
To list all active participants in an existing conference, use
latestEndTime IS NULL .
Retrieve participant details with the People API
To retrieve details about a participant, use the
get method on the
people resource in the People API.
Extract the ID of the person from the participant resource using the
trailing component of the path. For example, if the participant resource
value is conferenceRecords/abc-123/participants/12345 the ID for the
People API is 12345 .
Include the READ_SOURCE_TYPE_PROFILE , READ_SOURCE_TYPE_CONTACT , and
READ_SOURCE_TYPE_OTHER_CONTACT
ReadSourceType . This makes sure both
internal users to a Google Workspace organization and external contacts
are included in the response.
Caution: For privacy reasons, profile information might not be available for all
participants.
The following code sample shows how to search both organization profiles and
contacts for a person:
cURL
curl \
'https://people.googleapis.com/v1/people/ PERSON_ID ?personFields=names%2CemailAddresses&sources=READ_SOURCE_TYPE_OTHER_CONTACT&sources=READ_SOURCE_TYPE_PROFILE&sources=READ_SOURCE_TYPE_CONTACT' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN ' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--compressed
Replace the following:
PERSON_ID : the ID of the person to find.
ACCESS_TOKEN : the access token that grants access to
multiple APIs.
Participant sessions
The following sections detail how to get information about participant sessions
of a participant in a conference record.
Get details about a participant session
To get details about a specific participant session, use the
get
method on the
participantSessions
resource. Set the name path parameter using the format
conferenceRecords/{conferenceRecord}/participants/{participantRecord}/participantSessions/{participantSessionRecord} .
If you don't know the participant session name, you can list all participant
sessions of a participant using the list method.
The method returns a participant name as an instance of a participantSessions
resource.
The following code sample shows how to retrieve a specific participant session:
