Configure meeting spaces and members
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
A meeting space represents
a virtual place or a persistent object (such as a meeting room) where
conferences are held. A meeting space also helps users meet and find shared
resources.
When you create a meeting space using the
spaces.create method,
it returns an instance of a
spaces resource. The resource
includes the
SpaceConfig object
that's the configuration for the meeting space. It also contains the
ActiveConference
object that's a link to the current
conferenceRecords
resource within the meeting space. For more information on managing a meeting
space, see Create and manage meeting
spaces .
The following sections detail how to configure a meeting space using these
objects and methods.
Set moderation and meeting access
You can set how users join a meeting, the moderation modes, the feature
restrictions, and the permissions users receive when they join a meeting,
through the
SpaceConfig
object.
Access meeting spaces
To determine who can join a meeting space without knocking, set the
accessType
field using the
AccessType object.
You can choose from multiple settings on whether to automatically allow
attendees to join. The field defaults to the user's default access settings.
To define the entry points that can be used to join meetings hosted in a meeting
space, set the
entryPointAccess
field using the
EntryPointAccess
object. Set to ALL to allow all entry points or CREATOR_APP_ONLY to scope
the entry points to only those owned by the Google Cloud project that created the
meeting space.
Moderate meeting spaces
To moderate a meeting, you can set the
moderation
field using the
Moderation object.
When the moderation mode is on , the meeting organizer has control over the
meeting with features such as co-host management (see
spaces.members )
and feature restrictions using the
moderationRestrictions
field. For more information on members, see Manage space
members .
To define feature restrictions when the meeting is moderated ( moderation is
on ), set the moderationRestrictions field using the
ModerationRestrictions
object. The restrictions define who has permission within the meeting space to
send chat messages or reactions, or to share their screen.
To set the feature restrictions on the moderationRestrictions field, use the
RestrictionType
to apply the chatRestriction , reactionRestriction , presentRestriction . Set
to HOSTS_ONLY to apply the permissions to both the meeting organizer and
co-host, or NO_RESTRICTION to apply to all participants.
To restrict the default role assigned to users as viewer, set the boolean
defaultJoinAsViewerType
field using the
DefaultJoinAsViewerType .
If defaultJoinAsViewerType is on , users join as viewers. If off , users
join as contributors. Default is off . If an explicit role is set for a user in
spaces.members , the user joins as that role.
Generate attendance report
To create an attendance report for the meeting space, set the
attendanceReportGenerationType
field using the
AttendanceReportGenerationType
object. If a report is requested, Google Meet saves the attendance report to
the meeting organizer's Google Drive and an email is also sent.
Manage auto artifacts
Meeting organizers, but not co-hosts, can pre-configure auto-recording,
auto-transcripts, and smart notes within the meeting space. When these settings
are enabled, the meeting space is recorded, transcripts are generated, and
meeting notes are captured and organized into Google Docs
automatically. Each feature is independent and is set per meeting space.
Recording captions are only available in English.
You can pre-configure the auto artifacts either when you create a meeting
space or once
the meeting space is created. Both methods require the meetings.space.settings
OAuth scope. For more information, see OAuth scopes for
settings .
You can also set up auto artifacts for meetings created from Google Calendar.
To set auto artifacts, use the
ArtifactConfig
object, within the
SpaceConfig
object. ArtifactConfig is made up of the recordingConfig ,
transcriptionConfig , and smartNotesConfig fields.
Each field is mapped to a similar object such as
RecordingConfig ,
TranscriptionConfig ,
and
SmartNotesConfig
. To set each object, use the
AutoGenerationType
to toggle the config object on or off .
To retrieve the artifacts created during a conference, see Work with
artifacts .
Difference between transcripts and smart notes
While both meeting transcripts and smart notes (also known as "take notes for
me") capture information from your meeting, these features serve different
purposes and produce different artifacts.
The following table shows how they differ:
Feature
Transcripts
Smart notes
Overview
A verbatim, word-for-word record.
A concise summary of key points generated by Gemini.
Detail level
100% detail. Everything said is written down.
High-level. Focuses on decisions and action items.
Use case
Legal compliance, checking exact quotes, and user accessibility.
Allows late participants to catch up instantly; automates minute-taking and project tracking.
Real-time usage
Used for captions. The file is generated after the call.
You can view the summary building in the side panel during the call.
Output
A long Google Docs document with speaker name and timestamps.
A concise Google Docs document of meeting notes with sections and bullet points.
Citation
Contains the full text that can be linked to.
Includes citations (timestamps) that link back to the specific moment in the transcript for context, if both transcripts and smart notes are enabled. For more information, see When both features are enabled .
When both features are enabled
While each feature can be used separately, both transcripts and smart notes can
also be used at the same time to create better post-meeting artifacts.
When both are enabled, you'll see citations in your generated smart notes
document. These citations are located throughout the details section and link to
specific timestamps in the meeting transcript. By clicking on these citations,
you can jump directly to the relevant section in the transcript to gain a deeper
understanding of the discussion.
During the meeting, participants see indicators that both features are active.
They must remain active for the duration of the meeting to generate clickable
citations. Even though the files are interlinked, the system still generates two
distinct documents in the host's Google Drive. Both files are also
automatically attached to the Google Calendar event.
OAuth scopes for settings
Setting or accessing meetings settings requires the following OAuth scopes:
Use case
Scope code
Set auto artifact generation for spaces created by other apps.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.settings
Get or list artifacts from conferences created by other apps.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.readonly
Get or list other pre-meeting settings of a meeting space created by a third-party app.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.created
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.readonly
Read and edit the settings for all meeting spaces a user can access through any other app, such as Calendar.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.settings
For more information on OAuth scopes, see Meet REST API
scopes .
Manage space members
Developer Preview: Available as part of the
Google Workspace Developer Preview Program ,
which grants early access to certain features.
A space member is a user who's configured to have a role in the meeting space.
These users can join the meeting space without requesting permission to connect
(also known as "knocking").
While meeting organizers can automatically enter the meeting space, you can also
configure additional members to join the meeting without knocking. Additionally,
members can be configured to have a
Role
in the meeting, such as COHOST which gives them the same abilities to manage
the meeting as the meeting organizer. For more information about accessing a
meeting space without knocking, see
AccessType .
The
spaces.members
resource includes the name , user , and role fields.
Note that a member is different from a
participant . A participant is a
person joined to a call or that uses Companion
mode , watching as a viewer, or
a room device connected to a call. There's one
conferenceRecords.participants
resource for each person.
You can manage space members using the following methods:
spaces.members.create
spaces.members.delete
spaces.members.get
spaces.members.list
Note: To call these methods, use the /v2beta/ URL endpoint. For example, the
HTTP request for the spaces.members.list method becomes
https://meet.googleapis.com/v2beta/spaces/{space}/members .
Each method takes a path parameter with the create and list methods using the
parent field to denote the meeting space, and the delete and get methods using
the name field to filter the results based on the meeting space and the member
name. All methods, except delete, return an instance of the spaces.members
resource.
All methods, except delete, support the fields parameter in
SystemParameterContext .
When the fields parameter is omitted, the API response defaults to
"name,email,role,user" .
The fields parameter relies on a
FieldMask
for response filtering. A FieldMask is a way for API callers to list fields a
request should return. It's a comma-delimited list of fields to specify only
certain fields in an object are used while leaving the other fields unchanged.
Using a FieldMask allows the API to avoid unnecessary work and improves
performance. A field mask is used for create, get, and list methods. For more
information on field masks, see Google Sheets API's Use field
masks .
