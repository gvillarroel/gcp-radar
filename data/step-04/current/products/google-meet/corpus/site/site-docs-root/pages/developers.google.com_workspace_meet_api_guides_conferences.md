Work with conferences

This guide explains how to get details about a single conference or all
conferences on the conferenceRecords resource of the Google Meet REST API.
A conference is a
server-generated instance of a call within a meeting space. It's also a single
instance of a meeting.
If you're a meeting space owner or participant, you can call the get and
list methods to retrieve conference records.
Authenticating and authorizing with user
credentials lets
Google Meet apps access user data and perform operations on the authenticated
user's behalf. Authenticating with domain-wide
delegation
lets you authorize an application's service account to access your users' data
without requiring each user to give consent.
Get details about a conference
To get details about a specific conference, use the
get method on
the
conferenceRecords
resource. Set the conference name path parameter using the format
conferenceRecords/{conferenceRecord} .
If you don't know the conference name, you can list all conference
names using the list method.
The method returns a past conference as an instance of the conferenceRecords
resource.
The following code sample shows how to retrieve a specific conference:

curl -X GET "https://meet.googleapis.com/v2/conferenceRecords/ CONFERENCE_RECORD_NAME " \

Replace ACCESS_TOKEN with the access token that grants access to the API.
Replace the conference record name with the name of the specific conference ID
in a conference record.
List all conferences
To list details about all conferences, use the
list method on
the
conferenceRecords
resource without any path parameters.
The method returns a list of past conferences as an instance of the
conferenceRecords resource. They're filtered to the conference organizer and
ordered by startTime in descending order. To adjust the page size and filter
the query results, see Customize pagination or filter the
list .
Note: The list method only returns conferences where you're the meeting
organizer. If the app you're using to view conferences only has the
meetings.space.created OAuth scope, you can only view conferences for the
spaces the app created. For more information, see Meet REST API
scopes .
The following code sample shows how to list all conferences:

Customize pagination or filter the list
Pass the following optional query parameters to customize pagination of, or
filter, conference records:
pageSize : The maximum number of conference records to return. The service
might return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 25 conference
records are returned. The maximum value is 100; values more than 100 are
automatically changed to 100.
pageToken : A page token, received from a previous list call. Provide this
token to retrieve the subsequent page.
filter : A query filter to retrieve specific items in the
conferenceRecords resource results. For supported query details, see the
list
method. For more information on how to determine a meeting space, see How
Meet identifies a meeting
space .
