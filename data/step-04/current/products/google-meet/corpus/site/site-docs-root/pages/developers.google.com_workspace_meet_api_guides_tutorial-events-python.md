Observe meeting events with Python and the Google Meet REST API
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial shows how to use the Google Meet REST API along with the
Google Workspace Events API and Google Cloud Pub/Sub to observe and react to events
in a Meet meeting space. The sample application records when
conferences start and end, when participants join or leave, and when any
generated meeting artifacts are available.
Instead of subscribing to a specific meeting space, you can instead subscribe to
a Meet user to receive events for any meeting space that the
user owns or organizes. For details, see
Subscribe to Google Meet events
in the Google Workspace Events API documentation.
Prerequisites
If you need any of these prerequisites turned on for your organization, ask
your Google Workspace administrator to turn them on:
A Google Workspace account with
access to Google Meet .
Access to create a Google Cloud project .

Create a Google Cloud project
Google API Console
In the Google API Console, go to Menu menu
> IAM & Admin
> Create a Project .
Go to Create a Project
In the Project Name field, enter a descriptive name for your project.
Optional: To edit the Project ID , click Edit . The project ID can't be changed
after the project is created, so choose an ID that meets your needs for the lifetime of the
project.
In the Location field, click Browse to display potential locations for your
project. Then, click Select .
Click Create . The Google API Console navigates to the Dashboard page and your project is created
within a few minutes.

CLI ( gcloud ):
Cloud Shell : To use an online terminal with the gcloud CLI
already set up, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
Local Shell : To use a local development environment,
install and
initialize
the gcloud CLI.
To create a Cloud project, use the gcloud projects create command:
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID by setting the ID for the project you want to create.
Enable billing for the Google Cloud project
If you're unable to link a billing account, you don't have the
permissions needed to make this change. For more information, see
Permissions required to enable billing .
Google API Console
In the Google API Console, go to Billing . Click
Menu menu
> Billing
> My Projects .
Go to Billing for My Projects
In Select an organization , choose the organization associated with
your Google Cloud project.
In the project row, open the Actions menu
( more_vert ),
click Change billing , and choose the
Cloud Billing account.
Click Set account .
gcloud CLI
To list available billing accounts, run:
gcloud billing accounts list
Link a billing account with a Google Cloud project:
gcloud billing projects link PROJECT_ID --billing-account= BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID is the Project ID for the
Cloud project for which you want to enable billing.
BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID is the billing account ID to link with
the Google Cloud project.
Set up authentication and authorization
Authentication and authorization lets the app access Meet REST API
resources. User authorization is required to call the Meet REST API.
This section hows you how to configure user credentials and request
authorization.
Configure the OAuth consent screen and choose scopes
The following steps suggest placeholder information to configure
the OAuth consent screen for
your app. Before publishing the app externally, update this information.
In the Google API Console, go to Menu menu
> Google Auth platform
> Branding .
Go to Branding
If you have already configured the Google Auth platform, you can configure the following OAuth Consent Screen settings in Branding , Audience , and Data Access .
If you see a message that says Google Auth platform not configured yet , click Get Started :
Under App Information , in App name , enter Meet REST API Tutorial .
In User support email , choose a support email address where users can contact you if they have questions about their consent.
Click Next .
Under Audience , select Internal .
If unable to create an internal app, select External .
Click Next .
Under Contact Information , enter an Email address where you can be notified about any changes to your project.
Click Next .
Under Finish , review the Google API Services User Data Policy and if you agree, select I agree to the Google API Services: User Data Policy .
Click Continue .
Click Create .
If you selected External for user type, add test users:
Click Audience .
Under Test users , click Add users .
Enter your email address and any other authorized test users, then click Save .
Click Data Access > Add or Remove Scopes . A panel appears with a list of scopes
for each API that you've enabled in your Google Cloud project.
Under Manually add scopes , paste the following scopes:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.created
Click Add to Table .
Click Update .
After selecting the scopes required
by your app, click Save .
For more information about configuring OAuth consent, see
Get started with the Google Auth platform .
Create a client ID
The client ID acts as credentials for your application during the OAuth 2.0
flows. Since the app runs locally, create a desktop client ID.
In the Google API Console, go to Menu menu
> Google Auth platform
> Clients .
Go to Clients
Click Create Client .
Click Application type > Desktop app .
In the Name field, type a name for the credential. This name is only shown in the Google API Console.
Click Create .
The newly created credential appears under "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs."
Install the Google auth libraries
Install the Google auth libraries:
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib
Execute authorization
The Meet REST API requires user credentials in the form of an OAuth 2.0
access token. In this section, you implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to request an
access token and a refresh token for the user.
In your working directory, create the file main.py and add the following
contents:
import os
import json
from google.auth.transport import requests
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
def authorize () - > Credentials :
"""Ensure valid credentials for calling the Meet REST API."""
CLIENT_SECRET_FILE = "./client_secret.json"
credentials = None
if os . path . exists ( 'token.json' ):
credentials = Credentials . from_authorized_user_file ( 'token.json' )
if credentials is None :
flow = InstalledAppFlow . from_client_secrets_file (
CLIENT_SECRET_FILE ,
scopes = [
'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.created' ,
])
flow . run_local_server ( port = 0 )
credentials = flow . credentials
if credentials and credentials . expired :
credentials . refresh ( requests . Request ())
if credentials is not None :
with open ( "token.json" , "w" ) as f :
f . write ( credentials . to_json ())
return credentials
USER_CREDENTIALS = authorize ()
To run the code, both the client ID and the secret created earlier are
required. Copy the downloaded client secret file to the project working
directory and rename it as client_secret.json .
If you'd like to test how authorization works, run the following command.
The app prompts for authorization and creates a token.json file in the
project working directory after the request is approved.
python3 main.py
Add the Meet REST API
Now that the authorization code is complete, it's time to enable and call the
Meet REST API.
Enable the APIs
While this section is focused on the Meet REST API, this tutorial also uses
Google Cloud Pub/Sub and Google Workspace Events API.
Google API Console
In the Google API Console, enable the Google Meet REST API, the
Google Workspace Events API, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
Enable the
APIs
Confirm that you're enabling the APIs in the correct
Cloud project, then click Next .
Confirm that you're enabling the correct APIs, then click Enable .
gcloud CLI
If necessary, set the current Cloud project to the one you
created with the gcloud config set project command:
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with the Project ID of the
Cloud project you created.
Enable the Google Meet REST API, the Google Workspace Events API, and
Google Cloud Pub/Sub with the gcloud services enable command:
gcloud services enable meet.googleapis.com workspaceevents.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com
Install the Meet REST API client library
Follow these steps to install the Meet REST API client library:
Run the command:
pip install google-apps-meet
Edit the main.py file to import the client:
from google.apps import meet_v2 as meet
Create a space
Now that the Meet REST API is available, define a function to create a
meeting space that can be subscribed to.
Edit main.py and add:
def create_space () - > meet . Space :
"""Create a meeting space."""
client = meet . SpacesServiceClient ( credentials = USER_CREDENTIALS )
request = meet . CreateSpaceRequest ()
return client . create_space ( request = request )
Subscribe to events
To receive events about a meeting space, you create a subscription using the
Google Workspace Events API. You must also create and subscribe to a
Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic which serves as the notification endpoint where your
app receives the events.
Configure Google Cloud Pub/Sub
To create and subscribe to a Pub/Sub topic:
Google API Console
In the Google API Console, go to Menu menu
> Pub/Sub .
Go to Pub/Sub
Make sure that the Cloud project for your app is selected.
Click add_box Create topic and do the
following:
Enter workspace-events as the topic name.
Leave Add a default subscription selected.
Click Create . Your full topic name is formatted as
projects/{project}/topics/{topic} . Make a note
of this name for use in later steps.
Grant access to publish Pub/Sub messages to your topic:
On the side panel, open the
Permissions tab.
Click Add Principal .
In New principals , enter meet-api-event-push@system.gserviceaccount.com .
In Assign roles , select Pub/Sub Publisher .
Click Save .
It can take a few minutes to update the permissions for your topic.
gcloud CLI
In your Cloud project, create a topic by running the following:
gcloud pubsub topics create workspace-events
The output displays the full topic name, formatted as
projects/{project}/topics/{topic} . Make a note
of this name for use in later steps.
Grant access to publish messages to your topic:
gcloud pubsub topics add-iam-policy-binding workspace-events --member='serviceAccount:meet-api-event-push@system.gserviceaccount.com' --role='roles/pubsub.publisher'
It can take a few minutes to update the permissions for your topic.
Create a Pub/Sub subscription for the topic:
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create workspace-events-sub --topic= TOPIC_NAME
Replace the following:
TOPIC_NAME : The name of your topic that you created
in the previous step.
Make note of the topic name and make sure the value for {project} is the
Cloud project ID for your app. You'll use the topic name to create the
Google Workspace subscription later.
Create a service account
Google API Console
In the Google API Console, go to Menu menu
> IAM & Admin
> Service Accounts .
Go to Service Accounts
Click Create service account .
Fill in the service account details, then click Create and continue .
Note: By default, Google creates a unique service account ID. If you would like to
change the ID, modify the ID in the service account ID field.
In the Grant this service account access to project section, add the following roles:
roles/pubsub.subscriber
Click Continue .
Optional: Enter users or groups that can manage and perform actions with this service account. For more details, refer to Managing service account impersonation .
Click Done . Make a note of the email address for the service account.
gcloud CLI
Create the service account:
gcloud iam service-accounts create meet-event-listener \
--display-name="meet-event-listener"
Grant the necessary roles to the service account:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member="serviceAccount:meet-event-listener@ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
--role="roles/pubsub.subscriber"
Replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project ID.
Use the service account
After creating the service account, grant yourself access to impersonate the
service account.
Google API Console
In the Actions column for the newly created service account, click
more_vert
> Manage permissions .
Click Add key
> Grant access .
Enter your email address under Add principals .
Select Service accounts > Service Account Token Creator
as the role.
Click Save .
Return to your terminal and sign in with gcloud to set the application default credentials to the
service account. When prompted for authorization, sign in using the same
account used in the previous steps.
gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account= SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
gcloud CLI
To add the permission, run
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding
using the email address of the service account and the user.
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
--member="user: YOUR_EMAIL " \
--role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
Sign in to set the application default credentials to the
service account. When prompted for authorization, sign in using the same
account used in the previous steps.
gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account= SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
Install the Pub/Sub client library
Use pip to install the client library for Pub/Sub:
pip install google-cloud-pubsub
Then edit main.py to import the client:
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
Create the Google Workspace subscription
Add the following code to main.py to define a method for subscribing to
Meet events. This code subscribes to all events for a meeting
space. When subscribed, events are posted to the Pub/Sub topic.
def subscribe_to_space ( space_name : str = None , topic_name : str = None ):
"""Subscribe to events for a meeting space."""
session = requests . AuthorizedSession ( USER_CREDENTIALS )
body = {
'targetResource' : f "//meet.googleapis.com/ { space_name } " ,
"eventTypes" : [
"google.workspace.meet.conference.v2.started" ,
"google.workspace.meet.conference.v2.ended" ,
"google.workspace.meet.participant.v2.joined" ,
"google.workspace.meet.participant.v2.left" ,
"google.workspace.meet.recording.v2.fileGenerated" ,
"google.workspace.meet.transcript.v2.fileGenerated" ,
],
"payloadOptions" : {
"includeResource" : False ,
},

"pubsubTopic" : topic_name
},
"ttl" : "86400s" ,
}
response = session . post ( "https://workspaceevents.googleapis.com/v1/subscriptions" , json = body )
return response
Next, add the corresponding code to pull and process the events.
Listen for and handle events
Continue to edit main.py and add the following sample code. This code
implements the receiving side and uses the Google Cloud Pub/Sub API to pull
events as they're made available. The various handler methods print information
about the corresponding events.
def format_participant ( participant : meet . Participant ) - > str :
"""Formats a participant for display on the console."""

Finalize the code
Add the following code to main.py to call the methods to create the space,
subscribe to events, and listen. Update the TOPIC_NAME
and SUBSCRIPTION_NAME constants with your own topic
and subscription names that you previously
created.
Add the code to main.py :
space = create_space ()
print ( f "Join the meeting at { space . meeting_uri } " )
TOPIC_NAME = "projects/ PROJECT_ID /topics/ TOPIC_ID "
SUBSCRIPTION_NAME = "projects/ PROJECT_ID /subscriptions/ SUBSCRIPTION_ID "
subscription = subscribe_to_space ( topic_name = TOPIC_NAME , space_name = space . name )
if ( subscription . status_code ) == 200 :
listen_for_events ( subscription_name = SUBSCRIPTION_NAME )
else :
print ( f "Subscription to Meet events failed, response data: { subscription . content } " )
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID : The unique Cloud project ID for
your app, such as my-sample-project-191923 .
TOPIC_ID : The name of the Pub/Sub topic that you
created in your Cloud project.
SUBSCRIPTION_ID : The name of your subscription, such
as workspace-events-sub .
Run the program:
python3 main.py
If you haven't previously run the program, it prompts for authorization the
first time. Grant access to the application to call the Meet REST API.
After the program successfully runs, you should see output similar to:
Join the meeting at https://meet.google.com/abc-mnop-xyz
Join the conference
To generate events for the application, join the conference using the URL
displayed by the application. After you join, you can try these actions to
trigger events:
Leave and rejoin the meeting.
Invite others or dial in with your phone.
Enable recordings and transcripts.
Each of these activities generates an event that the application receives and
logs to the Google API Console.
Note: Recordings and transcripts can take several minutes after the meeting
ends to generate. Keep the program running after leaving the meeting and wait.
Use ctrl-c to interrupt the program when you're done.
Optional: Additional steps to try
The app logs basic details about the events. To continue exploring the
Meet REST API, try modifying the application to perform these additional
actions.
Use the People API to retrieve additional information about
signed-in participants.

Make sure to add "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile" in the authorize method in the credential samples above.
Use the Google Drive API to download recordings
and transcripts.
Instead of downloading transcripts from Google Drive, retrieve them using
the structured transcript
methods
in the Meet REST API.
get space instead of creating the space
def get_space ( meeting_code : str ) - > meet . Space :
"""Get a meeting space."""
client = meet . SpacesServiceClient ( credentials = USER_CREDENTIALS )
return client . get_space ( name = "spaces/" + meeting_code )
Make sure to add "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.readonly" in the authorize method in the credential samples above.

Caution: Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for this tutorial, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost. When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as a URL on appspot.com, delete the selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple tutorials and quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google API Console, go to the Manage resources page. Click
Menu menu
> IAM & Admin
> Manage Resources .
Go to Resource Manager
