Intercept endpoint groups and associations overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
An intercept endpoint group is a global, project-wide resource that
lets a consumer access a producer's interception service. Each intercept endpoint group is
associated with a single intercept deployment group on the producer side.
An intercept endpoint group association is a global, project-wide resource
that represents a consumer's VPC network to be inspected by a specific intercept
endpoint group. For each VPC that requires packet inspection, consumers create
an intercept endpoint group association.
This page provides a detailed overview of intercept endpoint groups and
intercept endpoint group associations.
Specifications
Intercept endpoint groups have the following specifications:
An intercept endpoint group is a global, project-wide resource.
The name of an intercept endpoint group is configured in the following
format:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/interceptEndpointGroups/ ENDPOINT_GROUP_ID
For example, the unique URL identifier for the intercept endpoint group
example-intercept-endpoint-group in project example-project is
projects/example-project/locations/global/interceptEndpointGroups/example-intercept-endpoint-group .
An intercept endpoint group association is a global, project-wide resource.
The name of an intercept endpoint association is configured in the following
format:
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/interceptEndpointAssociations/ ENDPOINT_GROUP_ASSOCIATION_ID
For example, the name for the intercept endpoint association ID
example-intercept-endpoint-association in project example-project is
projects/example-project/locations/global/interceptEndpointAssociations/example-intercept-endpoint-association .
You can use an intercept endpoint group across one or more VPCs in different
projects in an organization.
To enable interception for a VPC network, create
an intercept endpoint group association and the required firewall rules.
Identity and Access Management roles
The following table describes the Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles required for
managing the intercept endpoint groups:
Ability
Necessary role
Create an intercept endpoint group
Intercept Endpoint Admin role ( roles/networksecurity.interceptEndpointAdmin )
on the project.
Modify an existing intercept endpoint group
Intercept Endpoint Admin role ( roles/networksecurity.interceptEndpointAdmin ) on the project.
View details of an intercept endpoint group
Any of the following roles for the project:
Intercept Endpoint Admin role ( roles/networksecurity.interceptEndpointAdmin )
Intercept Endpoint Viewer role ( roles/networksecurity.interceptEndpointViewer )
View all intercept endpoint groups
Any of the following roles for the project:
Intercept Endpoint Admin role ( roles/networksecurity.interceptEndpointAdmin )
Intercept Endpoint Viewer role ( roles/networksecurity.interceptEndpointViewer )
The following table describes the Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles required for
managing the intercept endpoint group associations:
Ability
Necessary role
Create an intercept endpoint group association
Intercept Endpoint Admin role ( roles/networksecurity.interceptEndpointAdmin )
on the project where the intercept endpoint group association is created.
Intercept Endpoint User role ( roles/networksecurity.interceptEndpointUser )
on the project, which represents permissions to associate the
VPC (which the user is an administrator of) to
the intercept endpoint group (which is a project-owned resource, not
necessarily owned by the VPC owner).
Modify an existing intercept endpoint group association
Intercept Endpoint Admin role ( roles/networksecurity.interceptEndpointAdmin )
on the project where the VPC network exists.
View details of an intercept endpoint group association

Any of the following roles:
Intercept Endpoint Admin role ( roles/networksecurity.interceptEndpointAdmin )
