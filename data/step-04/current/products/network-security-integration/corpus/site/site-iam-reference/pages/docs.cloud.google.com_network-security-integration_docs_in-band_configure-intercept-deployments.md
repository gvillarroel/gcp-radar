Create and manage intercept deployments
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
An intercept
deployment
is a zonal resource that references the forwarding rule of an
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer whose backends are packet inspection VMs. An intercept
deployment represents the producer's inspection service offering for a zone.
This page describes how to create and manage intercept deployments.
Before you begin
Enable the
Network Security API in
your project.
Install the gcloud CLI .
Create an intercept deployment
group .
Make sure you have a forwarding rule that directs network traffic to the
internal passthrough Network Load Balancer whose backends provide packet inspection. For more information,
see Set up producer
services .
Roles
To create, view, or delete intercept deployments, your Identity and Access Management (IAM)
principal must have the necessary IAM
roles
on your project. For more information, see Manage access to projects, folders,
and organizations .
To check the progress of the operations listed on this page, your
IAM principal must have the following Intercept Deployment Admin
role
( roles/networksecurity.interceptDeploymentAdmin ) permissions:
networksecurity.interceptDeployments.create
networksecurity.interceptDeployments.delete
networksecurity.interceptDeployments.get
networksecurity.interceptDeployments.list
Create an intercept deployment
Create an intercept deployment to represent the producer's compute resources
within a zone and associate it with an existing intercept deployment group.
You can create the intercept deployments in the same project that contains the parent intercept deployment group. We recommend that you create the intercept deployment in a project owned by your
security administrator.
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or one of the following IAM roles on your organization.
Permissions
networksecurity.interceptDeployments.create
Roles
Intercept Deployment Admin role ( networksecurity.interceptDeploymentAdmin )
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Deployment groups page.
Go to Deployment groups
Click the deployment group where you want to add the intercept
deployment.
Click Create intercept deployment .
For Name , enter a name of the intercept deployment.
For Region and Zone , select your region and zone.
For Internal load balancer , select the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer.
For Forwarding rule , select the UDP forwarding rule of the load
balancer. If the load balancer has only one forwarding rule, it is selected by default and the field is disabled.
Note: The forwarding rule's VPC network must match the intercept
deployment group's network.
Click Create .
gcloud
To create an intercept deployment, use the gcloud network-security
intercept-deployments create
command :
gcloud network-security intercept-deployments create DEPLOYMENT_ID \
--location ZONE \
--forwarding-rule FWD_RULE \
--forwarding-rule-location REGION \
--no-async \
--intercept-deployment-group \
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/global/interceptDeploymentGroups/ DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_ID
Replace the following:
DEPLOYMENT_ID : the ID of the intercept deployment.
ZONE : the zone where you want to create the
intercept deployment.
FWD_RULE : the forwarding rule of an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer in
the same region as the zone of the intercept deployment.
REGION : the region that contains the zone of the
intercept deployment.
PROJECT_ID : the ID of the Google Cloud project.
DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_ID : the ID of the intercept deployment group.
Terraform
To create an intercept deployment, you can use a google_network_security_intercept_deployment resource .
resource "google_network_security_intercept_deployment" "default" {
intercept_deployment_id = "intercept-deployment"
location = "us-central1-a"
forwarding_rule = google_compute_forwarding_rule.default.id
intercept_deployment_group = google_network_security_intercept_deployment_group.default.id
}
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see
Basic Terraform commands .
View details of an intercept deployment
You can view the details of an intercept deployment, including its name, its
forwarding rule, and its location.
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or one of the following IAM roles on your project.
Permissions
networksecurity.interceptDeployments.get
Roles
Intercept Deployment Admin role ( networksecurity.interceptDeploymentAdmin )
Intercept Deployment Viewer role ( networksecurity.interceptDeploymentViewer )
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Deployment groups page.
Go to Deployment groups
Click the name of the deployment group.
Click the name of the deployment.
gcloud
To view details of an intercept deployment, use the gcloud
network-security intercept-deployments describe
command :
gcloud network-security intercept-deployments describe DEPLOYMENT_ID \
--location ZONE
Replace the following:
DEPLOYMENT_ID : the ID of the intercept deployment.
ZONE : the zone of the intercept deployment.
In the output, the name of the intercept deployment is displayed in the
projects/ PROJECT_ID /locations/ ZONE /interceptDeployments/ DEPLOYMENT_ID
format.
List intercept deployments
You can list all intercept deployments in a project, including their IDs and
locations.
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or one of the following IAM roles on your organization.
Permissions
networksecurity.interceptDeployments.list
Roles
Intercept Deployment Admin role ( networksecurity.interceptDeploymentAdmin )
Intercept Deployment Viewer role ( networksecurity.interceptDeploymentViewer )
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Deployment groups page.
Go to Deployment groups
Click the name of the deployment group.
gcloud
To list intercept deployments, use the gcloud network-security
intercept-deployments list
command :
gcloud network-security intercept-deployments list \
[--location ZONE ]
To see intercept deployments in a specific zone, replace
ZONE with the zone of the intercept deployments.
This setting is optional.
Delete an intercept deployment
You can delete an intercept deployment if it is not referenced by any intercept
deployment group.
Permissions required for this task
To perform this task, you must have been granted the following permissions
or one of the following IAM roles on your organization.
Permissions
networksecurity.interceptDeployments.delete
Roles
Intercept Deployment Admin role ( networksecurity.interceptDeploymentAdmin )
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Deployment groups page.
Go to Deployment groups
Click the name of the intercept deployment group.
Select the checkbox of the intercept deployment and click Delete .
Click Delete again to confirm.
gcloud
To delete an intercept deployment, use the gcloud network-security
intercept-deployments delete
command :
gcloud network-security intercept-deployments delete DEPLOYMENT_ID \
--no-async \
--location ZONE
Replace the following:
DEPLOYMENT_ID : the ID of the intercept deployment.
ZONE : the zone of the intercept deployment.
