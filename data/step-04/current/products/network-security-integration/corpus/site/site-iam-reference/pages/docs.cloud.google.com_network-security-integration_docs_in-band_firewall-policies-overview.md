Firewall policies and rules overview
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Firewall policies are a collection
of firewall rules that let you control the ingress and egress flow of traffic in
a VPC network. Firewall policy
rules enable you to explicitly
deny or allow connections.
In in-band Network Security Integration, you use
hierarchical
and global network (recommended) firewall
policy and rules to redirect network traffic. The traffic flows through the VPC network's intercept endpoint group, the producer's intercept deployment group, and then to the producer's compute resources for traffic inspection.
This page describes the firewall policies and rules used for packet inspection.
Firewall policies and rules
To redirect traffic to intercept endpoint group, you can create network or
hierarchical firewall policies and rules.
When you create a firewall policy, you must create a firewall rule with the
action APPLY_SECURITY_PROFILE_GROUP . The rule must reference the security
profile group containing the custom-intercept-profile action.
Priority
The priority of the firewall rule must be an integer from 0 to 2,147,483,547,
inclusive. Lower integers indicate higher priorities. For more information, see
Firewall rule
priority .
Action on match
A rule in a firewall policy can have one of the following actions:
The allow action permits traffic and stops further rule evaluation.
The deny action denies traffic and stops further rule evaluation.
The apply_security_profile_group action transparently intercepts the
traffic and sends it to the configured firewall
endpoint or to the intercept
endpoint
group
for inspection. The decision to allow or deny the packet then depends on the
firewall endpoint (or on the intercept endpoint group) and the configured
security profile. In both the cases, the rule evaluation process stops.
The fallback action for firewall rules that use
apply_security_profile_group is allow . If the inspection fails because
of an incomplete configuration, such as when you don't associate the
VPC network with the intercept endpoint group, the firewall
allows the traffic by default. For such scenarios, in the firewall logs, the
apply_security_profile_fallback_action field displays UNSPECIFIED .
For more information, see Policy and rule evaluation
order .
Egress and ingress
An ingress rule with a deny action protects all instances by blocking incoming
connections to them. A higher priority rule might allow incoming access.
An egress rule with an allow action lets an instance send traffic to the
destinations specified in the rule. Egress can be denied by higher priority deny
firewall rules. Google Cloud also blocks or
limits certain kinds of traffic.
After you add the firewall rule to the policies, you then associate the firewall
policy with your network. For more information, see Create and manage
rules .
Protocols and ports
Similar to firewall rules, you must specify one or more protocol and port
constraints when you create a firewall rule. When specifying TCP or UDP in a
firewall rule, you can specify the protocol, the protocol and a destination
port, or the protocol and a destination port range; you cannot specify only a
port or port range. Also, you can only specify destination ports. Rules based on
source ports are not supported.
You can use the following protocol names in firewall rules:
tcp
udp
icmp (for IPv4 ICMP)
esp
ah
sctp
ipip
For all other protocols, use the IANA protocol
numbers .
For more information, see Firewall rules protocol and
ports .
Direction
The direction in which the firewall rule applies. It can be either INGRESS or
EGRESS .
INGRESS : ingress direction refers to the incoming connections sent from
specific sources to Google Cloud targets. Ingress rules apply to inbound
packets, where the destination of the packets is the target.
An ingress rule with a deny action protects all instances by blocking
incoming connections to them. A higher priority rule might allow incoming
access. An automatically created default network includes some pre-populated
Virtual Private Cloud firewall rules, which allow ingress for certain
types of traffic.
EGRESS : egress direction refers to the outbound traffic sent from a target
to a destination. Egress rules apply to packets for new connections where
the source of the packet is the target.
