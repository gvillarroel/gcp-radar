OpenAPI
| gRPC
Endpoints is a distributed API management system comprising
services, runtimes, and tools. Endpoints provides management,
monitoring, and authentication.
The components that make up Endpoints are:
Extensible Service Proxy (ESP) or Extensible Service Proxy V2 (ESPv2) - for injecting Endpoints
functionality.
Service Control - for applying API management rules.
Service Management - for configuring API management rules.
Google Cloud CLI - for deploying and management.
Google Cloud console - for logging, monitoring and sharing.
Endpoints architecture
Endpoints components
ESP
ESP is a NGINX-based proxy that runs in front of the
backend and injects Endpoints functionality such as
authentication, monitoring, and logging. ESP retrieves a service
configuration from Service Management and uses it to validate incoming
requests.
ESP is designed for you to deploy it in a containerized
environment and validate JWTs and Google ID tokens. It employs a variety of
techniques, such as heavy caching and asynchronous calls to remain lightweight
and highly performant.
ESP support is available for the following platforms:
App Engine flexible environment
Compute Engine
Google Kubernetes Engine
Kubernetes
ESPv2
ESPv2 is an Envoy -based
high-performance, scalable proxy that runs in front of an OpenAPI or gRPC API backend.
Endpoints on ESPv2 supports version 2 of the
OpenAPI Specification and gRPC specifications.
ESPv2 integrates with Google Service Infrastructure to enable API management features
at scale, including authentication, telemetry reports, metrics, and security.
ESPv2 support is available for the following platforms:
App Engine Standard environment
Cloud Run functions
Cloud Run
Knative serving
Compute Engine
Google Kubernetes Engine
Kubernetes
Service Control
Service Control applies API management rules at
runtime, such as key authentication, monitoring, and logging.
Service Control provides the following methods:
Check - verifies authentication and API keys, and indicates whether a call
should be permitted
Report - notifies the systems of record for logging and monitoring
Service Management
You use the OpenAPI specification to
describe the surface and the behavior of your API in a text file referred to as
the Endpoints configuration. You deploy the
Endpoints configuration to Service Management by using
the gcloud CLI, which configures the API management rules.
Other configuration related tasks also happen here, such as sharing your API
with other developers, enabling or disabling the API in different projects, and
generating API keys.
The gcloud CLI
The gcloud CLI provides the Google Cloud CLI that you
can use to make calls to various Google Cloud services. You use the
Google Cloud CLI to deploy your Endpoints
configuration to Service Management.
Google Cloud console
Google Cloud console is the graphical user interface for
Google Cloud. Endpoints uses the
Google Cloud console to expose monitoring and logging data that are sent from
ESP or ESPv2 and recorded by Service Control and share APIs with other
developers, and for them to generate API keys to call the API.
Deployment scenarios
Options for deployment vary depending upon the use of ESP or ESPv2 as the Endpoints proxy. ESPv2 can be deployed as a remote proxy and both ESPv2 and ESP can be deployed in sidecar mode, as explained in the following sections.
Remote proxy mode
If using ESPv2, Endpoints can be deployed as a remote proxy. This mode is used to support applications running on serverless platforms such as Cloud Run, Cloud Run functions, and App Engine for standard environments.
In this mode, ESPv2 is deployed as a Cloud Run application. The application is configured to use ESPv2 as a remote backend using the x-google-backend field in the OpenAPI service config. When functioning as a remote proxy in this deployment mode, a single ESPv2 can support multiple remote backends.
See Configuring Endpoints for more details.
Sidecar mode
Both ESP and ESPv2 support deployment in a container alongside each instance of your backend. This server-local topology is ideal for both
web-facing APIs as well as microservices. It avoids the network hop typically
associated with centralized proxies and allows API management that is highly
performant as well as scalable.
Typically, load balancing is applied before traffic hits ESP or ESPv2.
On App Engine, load balancing happens automatically.
On Compute Engine, it is accomplished by Cloud Load Balancing. For
Kubernetes deployments, you can use an ingress proxy for load balancing. In
Google Kubernetes Engine, you can use either Cloud Load Balancing or an ingress
proxy for load balancing.
Upon startup, ESP or ESPv2 obtains its service configuration from
Service Management. The service configuration is generated from the
OpenAPI specification or from
gRPC ,
the service configuration YAML file. It tells ESP or ESPv2 both the
surface of the API to be managed along with the policies, such as
which methods require authentication, and which require API keys.
Request routing
When a request is received, ESP or ESPv2 creates a trace token for
Cloud Trace.
Next, ESP or ESPv2 matches the path of the incoming requests with the
surface of the API. After finding a matching route, ESP or ESPv2 performs
any authentication steps for the specified method.
If JWT validation is necessary, ESP or ESPv2 validates the authentication
using the appropriate public key for the signer, and validates the audience
field in the JWT. If an API key is required, ESP or ESPv2 calls the
Service Control API to validate the key.
Service Control looks up the key to validate it, and ensures that the
project associated with the key has enabled the API. If the key isn't valid or
the project hasn't enabled the API, the call is rejected and it is logged via
the Service Control API.
If Service Control successfully validates the key, the request along with
all original headers, plus a JWT validation header, if appropriate, is forwarded
to the backend.
When a response is received from the backend, ESP or ESPv2 returns the
response to the caller and sends the final timing information to
Trace. The call points are logged by the Service Control
API, which writes metrics and logs to their appropriate destinations.
ESP or ESPv2 on Kubernetes
The following diagram shows the overall architecture where ESP
runs as a side-car container in front of the API service application
container, with my-api API hosted at my-api.com and backed by a
Kubernetes service . The architecture would be the same for a sidecar deployment with ESPv2.
