Cloud Endpoints Frameworks is a web
framework for the App Engine
standard Python 2.7 and Java 8 runtime
environments .
Cloud Endpoints Frameworks provides the tools and libraries that allow you to
generate REST APIs and client libraries for your application.
Note: Endpoints Frameworks doesn't support the PHP, Go, or Node.js
runtimes.
Like other web frameworks, Endpoints Frameworks handles the low-level
communication details of HTTP requests and responses for your application. When
a client sends a request to your API, Endpoints Frameworks routes the
request's URL to the function or method in your code that processes the request.
Endpoints Frameworks converts the return value to JSON and sends the
response. You add metadata (by using annotations in Java and decorators in
Python) to your source code. The metadata defines the
surface of the REST APIs for your
application.
Java
@ApiMethod ( name = "echo" )
public Message echo ( Message message , @Named ( "n" ) @Nullable Integer n ) {
return doEcho ( message , n );
}
In the example code, the
annotations begin with
the @ character.
Python
@endpoints . method (
# This method takes a ResourceContainer defined above.
ECHO_RESOURCE ,
# This method returns an Echo message.
EchoResponse ,
path = "echo" ,
http_method = "POST" ,
name = "echo" ,
)
def echo ( self , request ):
output_message = " " . join ([ request . message ] * request . n )
return EchoResponse ( message = output_message )
In the example code, the
decorators begin with
the @ character.
With Endpoints Frameworks, you don't have to deploy a third-party web
server (such as Apache Tomcat or Gunicorn) with your application. You annotate
or decorate the code and deploy your application as you normally would to the
App Engine standard environment .
API management
The Extensible Service Proxy
(ESP)
provides API management features for Endpoints for OpenAPI and
Endpoints for gRPC. ESP runs in a container
alongside each instance of your backend.
Because the App Engine standard environment didn't support
multi-container deployments when Endpoints Frameworks was
under development, Endpoints Frameworks doesn't use
ESP. Instead, Endpoints Frameworks includes a built-in
API gateway
that provides API management features that are comparable to the
features that ESP provides for Endpoints for OpenAPI and
Endpoints for gRPC.
Endpoints Frameworks intercepts all requests and performs any
necessary checks (such as authentication) before forwarding the request to the
API backend. When the backend responds, Endpoints Frameworks gathers
and reports telemetry. You can view metrics for your API on the Endpoints
Services page in the Google Cloud console.
You can use Endpoints Frameworks with or without API management
functionality. Use of Endpoints Frameworks without API management
functionality is offered at no charge. API management functionality is charged
according to the Endpoints pricing
page .
Limitations
Endpoints Frameworks is supported only on the App Engine
standard Python 2.7 and Java 8 runtime environments.
Endpoints Frameworks doesn't support the Node.js, PHP, and Go
runtime environments on the App Engine standard environment.
Endpoints Frameworks doesn't support the App Engine flexible environment.
Endpoints Frameworks doesn't support Cloud Run functions,
Compute Engine, and Google Kubernetes Engine.
