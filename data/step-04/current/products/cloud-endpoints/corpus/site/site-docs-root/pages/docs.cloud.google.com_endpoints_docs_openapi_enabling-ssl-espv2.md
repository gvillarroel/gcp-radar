This page explains how to enable a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) port when deploying Extensible Service Proxy V2
(ESPv2) with Google Kubernetes Engine, Kubernetes, or
Compute Engine. You may want to enable an SSL port for your deployed Endpoints service for some use cases.
Before you begin, make sure that you have already reviewed the tutorials for your chosen service type and environment, and know how to deploy
ESPv2 without SSL.
Note: This tutorial describes how to use self-managed SSL certificates with
ESPv2. Google-managed SSL certificates aren't currently supported
by ESPv2.
Configuring your SSL keys and certificates
To configure your SSL port to serve HTTPS requests, follow the steps below:
Check to ensure that your SSL key file is named server.key and your certificate file is named server.crt . For testing, you can generate a self-signed server.key and
server.crt using OpenSSL with the following command:
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
-keyout ./server.key -out ./server.crt
Specify both CN and subjectAltName in your server certificate. The value of these attributes
should match the DNS or IP used by clients to call your service; otherwise, the
SSL handshake will fail.
Enabling SSL for ESPv2 on Kubernetes
To enable the SSL port for ESPv2 on Kubernetes:
Create a Kubernetes secret with your SSL key and certificate:
kubectl create secret generic esp-ssl \
--from-file=./server.crt --from-file=./server.key
Edit the Kubernetes configuration files, for example, echo-ssl.yaml ,
as shown in the following snippet:
template :
metadata :
labels :
app : esp-echo
spec :
volumes :
- name : esp-ssl
secret :
secretName : esp-ssl
containers :
- name : esp
image : gcr.io/endpoints-release/endpoints-runtime:2
args : [
"--listener_port" , "9000" ,
"--backend" , "127.0.0.1:8081" ,
"--service" , "SERVICE_NAME" ,
"--rollout_strategy" , "managed" ,
"--ssl_server_cert_path" , "/etc/esp/ssl" ,
]
ports :
- containerPort : 9000
volumeMounts :
- mountPath : /etc/esp/ssl
name : esp-ssl
readOnly : true
- name : echo
image : gcr.io/endpoints-release/echo:latest
ports :
- containerPort : 8081
Note : The configuration sample displays the lines
that need to be edited. To deploy the file to Cloud Endpoints, the complete
configuration file is required.
Note: The ESPv2 container cannot bind to privileged ports, including port 443. Instead, use a Kubernetes Service resource to map 443 to a non-privileged --listener_port , such as 9000 .
Mount the Kubernetes secrets you created as volumes, following the
directions in the Kubernetes volumes
page .
Start up ESPv2 as described in
Specifying startup options for ESPv2 ,
but make sure you add the startup flag --ssl_server_cert_path to specify the path for the mounted certificate files.
Start the service with the updated Kubernetes configuration file by using kubectl .
kubectl apply -f echo-ssl.yaml
Note: If you already have an existing Kubernetes
deployment , you can
update the deployment
directly.
Generate the root certificate for the client by using the following OpenSSL
command:
openssl x509 -in ./server.crt -out ./client.pem -outform PEM
If the client is using curl , the file client.pem can be used in the
--caroot flag. For gRPC, the client.pem is used as the root certificate
file of the SSL credential for gRPC channel.
Update SSL certificates
It is important to update your SSL certificates periodically.
To update your SSL certificates, you must perform the following steps:
Create new certificates, as described in Step 1 above.
Mount the new certificates to the Kubernetes secrets, as described in Step 3 above.
Update the ESPv2 Kubernetes deployment, as described in Step 5 above.
Regenerate the client root certificate file, as described in Step 6 above.
Enabling SSL for ESPv2 on Compute Engine
To enable SSL on Compute Engine, first copy the server.key and server.crt files to
your Compute Engine instance's /etc/nginx/ssl folder, using the following steps:
Run the following command and replace INSTANCE_NAME
with the name of your Compute Engine instance:
gcloud compute scp server.* INSTANCE-NAME
Connect to the instance using ssh .
gcloud compute ssh INSTANCE-NAME
In the instance VM box, make the directory and copy in the files:
sudo mkdir -p /etc/esp/ssl
sudo cp server.* /etc/esp/ssl/
Follow the instructions for your service type to deploy with Docker. When you
run the ESPv2 Docker container, use this command:
sudo docker run --name=esp \
--detach \
--publish=443:9000 \
--net=esp_net \
--volume=/etc/esp/ssl:/etc/esp/ssl \
gcr.io/endpoints-release/endpoints-runtime:2 \
--service= SERVICE_NAME \
--rollout_strategy=managed \
--backend=echo:8080 \
--ssl_server_cert_path=/etc/esp/ssl \
--listener_port=9000
As compared to the non-SSL docker run command, the SSL version of the
command creates a different configuration. For example, the SSL command:
Mounts the folder with the key and CRT files to the container by using
--volume .
Uses --ssl_server_cert_path=/etc/esp/ssl to tell ESPv2 to find
the server certificate files server.key and server.crt in the /etc/esp/ssl folder.
Changes the port mapping flag --publish . Incoming requests to HTTPS port 443 are mapped to ESPv2 port 9000.
Note: The ESPv2 container cannot bind to privileged ports, including port 443. Instead, use the --publish flag to map 443 to a non-privileged --listener_port , such as 9000 .
Update SSL certificates
It is important to update your SSL certificates periodically.
To update your SSL certificates, you must perform the following steps:
Create new certificates and copy them into VM instances, as described in Step 1 above.
Copy the new certificates into the /etc/esp/ssl directory, as described in Step 3 above.
Stop and restart the ESPv2 container using the sudo docker run command, as described in Step 4 above.
Testing the SSL port
To make the testing the SSL port easier, set the following environment variables:
Set IP_ADDRESS to the IP address of the Compute Engine instance with the new SSL certificate.
Note: The example test commands below assume that the server does not yet have a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and that IP_ADDRESS has been used as the FQDN when generating the self-signed certificate. When the server does get an FQDN, use the FQDN to generate the certificate. Then, replace IP_ADDRESS with the FQDN in the example commands below.
Set ENDPOINTS_KEY to a valid API key .
Once the SSL port is enabled, you can use HTTPS to send requests to the
Extensible Service Proxy. If your certificate is self-signed,
use -k to turn on the insecure option in curl :
curl -k -d '{"message":"hello world"}' -H "content-type:application/json" \
https:// IP_ADDRESS :443/echo?key= ENDPOINTS_KEY
Alternatively, generate the certificate in pem format and use the --cacert option to use the self-signed certificate in curl , as shown below:
openssl x509 - in server . crt - out client . pem - outform PEM
curl -- cacert "./client.pem" - d ' { "message" : "hello world" } ' - H "content-type:application/json" \
https : // IP_ADDRESS :443/echo?key= ENDPOINTS_KEY
