OpenAPI
| gRPC
To deploy your OpenAPI document, you run the
gcloud endpoints services deploy
command. The first time you deploy your OpenAPI document, the gcloud command
calls a Service Management API to create a managed service by using the name
that you specified in the host field of your OpenAPI document.
Service Management automatically assigns a configuration ID, which
consists of a date stamp followed by a revision number. For example:
2017-02-13r0
If you deploy your service configuration again on the same day,
Service Management increments the revision number in the configuration
ID. If you deploy your service configuration again on another day,
Service Management assigns a new date stamp to the configuration ID and
resets the revision number to 0.
Endpoints uses Service Management to store service
configurations. Service Management stores only the latest 100 service
configurations.
This page describes how to view the name of your service and configuration IDs.
Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Endpoints > Services page for
your project.
Go to the Endpoints Services page
If you have more than one API, select an API from the list.
Click the Deployment history tab.
The service name is displayed between the API name and the tabs,
near the top-left side of the page. In the Service configuration
deployments list, the configuration ID is displayed along with the date and
the email address of the principal who deployed the configuration. The
Service configuration deployments list displays the latest 100
configuration deployments. The most recent configuration is displayed at
the top of the list.
gcloud
Enter the following to display the project IDs for your
Google Cloud projects:
gcloud projects list
Using the applicable project ID from the previous step, set the default
project to the one that your API is in:
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
Get a list of services in your project:
gcloud endpoints services list
Using the applicable service name from the previous step, get a list of
configuration IDs for the service:
gcloud endpoints configs list --service= YOUR_SERVICE_NAME
For more information on the preceding commands, see the gcloud reference .
