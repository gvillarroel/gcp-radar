OpenAPI
| gRPC
This page shows you how to run multiple independent APIs on your own custom
domain (for example, example.com ).
Before you begin
To use a custom domain, follow the instructions in
Verifying a domain name .
During that process, you must confirm ownership of the domain. This confirmation
lets you deploy and service APIs on any of its subdomains.
For example, if domain ownership is established for example.com , service names
can include subdomains of example.com such as api.example.com or
catalog.api.example.com .
Deploying an API on a subdomain
The following example deploys the API to the subdomain first_api.example.com :
Set the host field of your OpenAPI document to first_api.example.com
and set the other fields as described in
Configuring Cloud Endpoints .
Deploy the Endpoints configuration .
Deploy the API backend .
Now you can send requests to first_api.example.com and view graphs of those
requests on the
Endpoints > Services page .
Deploying your next API
To deploy another API, repeat the preceding steps, changing the subdomain
first_api.example.com to the subdomain you are using for the next API.
