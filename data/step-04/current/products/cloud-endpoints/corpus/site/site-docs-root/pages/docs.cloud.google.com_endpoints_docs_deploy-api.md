Deploy an API managed by Cloud Endpoints
This QuickStart walks you through deploying a sample API, which
Cloud Endpoints manages. The sample code includes:
A REST API that you can query to find the name of an airport from its
three-letter IATA code.
A script that uploads the API configuration to Endpoints.
A script that deploys an App Engine flexible environment backend to host the
sample API.
After you send requests to the sample API, you can view the
Endpoints activity graphs and Google Cloud Observability logs in the
Google Cloud console. These tools let you monitor your APIs and gain insights into
their usage.
This QuickStart uses scripts to simplify the configuration steps for you to
quickly see the activity graphs and logs in action. To learn how to
configure and deploy a sample API, choose a tutorial for one of the API
frameworks:
Cloud Endpoints for OpenAPI: Tutorials
Cloud Endpoints for gRPC: Tutorials
Cloud Endpoints Frameworks: Tutorials
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
Google Cloud,

In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
granted a role on.
Create a project : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role
( roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator ), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Note : If you don't plan to keep the
resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to deploy and manage an API,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on your project:
Deploy the Endpoints configuration:
Service Management Administrator ( roles/servicemanagement.admin )
Enable required services:
Service Usage Admin ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin )
Create the App Engine application:
App Engine Creator ( roles/appengine.appCreator )
Deploy the sample API to App Engine:
App Engine Deployer ( roles/appengine.deployer )
Cloud Build Editor ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor )
Storage Object User ( roles/storage.objectUser )
Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
You might also be able to get
the required permissions through custom
roles or other predefined
roles .
Starting Cloud Shell
In the Google Cloud console, make sure you are in the project that you
want to use for the sample API.
Open Cloud Shell.
Open Cloud Shell
A Cloud Shell session opens inside a new frame at the bottom of the
Google Cloud console and displays a command-line prompt. It can take a few
seconds for the session to initialize.
If you're using an existing project, make sure you have the latest version of
all installed gcloud components:
gcloud components update
Note: If you're on a Linux or macOS machine and want to follow this
quickstart using your local shell, download the
Google Cloud CLI and carry out these
quickstart instructions by using your local command-line interface instead of
Cloud Shell.
Getting the sample code
In Cloud Shell, enter the following command to get the sample API
and scripts:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/endpoints-quickstart
Change to the directory that contains the sample code:
cd endpoints-quickstart
Deploying the Endpoints configuration
To publish a REST API to Endpoints, an OpenAPI configuration file
that describes the API is required. The sample API comes with a pre-configured
OpenAPI file called openapi.yaml .
Endpoints uses Service Management, an infrastructure service of
Google Cloud to create and manage APIs and services. To use
Endpoints to manage an API, you deploy the API's OpenAPI
configuration file to Service Management.
To deploy the Endpoints configuration:
In Cloud Shell, in the endpoints-quickstart directory, enter the
following:
cd scripts
Run the following script, which is included in the sample:
./deploy_api.sh
Endpoints uses the host field in the OpenAPI configuration file
to identify the service. The deploy_api.sh script sets the ID of your
Google Cloud project as part of the name configured in the host field.
When you prepare an OpenAPI configuration file for your own service, you need to
do this manually.
The script then deploys the OpenAPI configuration to Service Management
by using the command: gcloud endpoints services deploy openapi.yaml
As it is creating and configuring the service, Service Management outputs
information to the Google Cloud console. You can safely ignore the warnings
about the paths in openapi.yaml not requiring an API key. On successful
completion, you see a line similar to the following that displays the service
configuration ID and the service name:
Service Configuration [ 2017 - 02 - 13 - r2 ] uploaded for service [ airports - api . endpoints . example - project . cloud . goog ]
Enabling required services
At a minimum, Endpoints requires the following Google services to be enabled:
Name
Title
servicecontrol.googleapis.com
Service Control API
servicemanagement.googleapis.com
Service Management API
In most cases, deploying the Endpoints configuration enables these
required services.
Use the following command to confirm that the required services are enabled:
gcloud services list
If you don't see the required services listed, enable them:
gcloud services enable servicemanagement.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable servicecontrol.googleapis.com
Also enable your Endpoints service:
gcloud services enable YOUR-PROJECT-ID .appspot.com
For more information about the gcloud commands, see
gcloud services .
Deploying the API backend
So far you have deployed the OpenAPI configuration to Service Management,
but you haven't yet deployed the code to serve the API backend. The
deploy_app.sh script included in the sample creates an App Engine
flexible environment to host the API backend, and then the script deploys the
API to App Engine.
To deploy the API backend:
In Cloud Shell, in the endpoints-quickstart/scripts directory, run
the following script:
./deploy_app.sh
The script runs the following command to create an App Engine flexible
environment in the us-central region:
gcloud app create --region="$REGION"
It takes several minutes to create the App Engine flexible environment
backend. After the application is created, the output is:
Success! The app is now created.
Next, the script runs the gcloud app deploy command to
deploy the sample API to App Engine.
The output is:
Deploying ../app/app_template.yaml...You are about to deploy the following services:
It takes several minutes to deploy the API to App Engine. When the API is
successfully deployed to App Engine, the output is:
Deployed service [default] to [https://example-project.appspot.com]
Sending requests to the API
In Cloud Shell, after deploying the sample API, you can send requests
to it by running the following script:
./query_api.sh
The script echoes the curl command that it uses to send a request to the API,
and then displays the result. The output is:
curl "https://example-project.appspot.com/airportName?iataCode=SFO"
San Francisco International Airport
The API expects one query parameter, iataCode , that is set to a valid IATA
airport code such as SEA or JFK . For example:
./query_api.sh JFK
Note : App Engine may take a few minutes to
respond successfully to requests. If you send a request and get an
HTTP 502, 503, or some other server error, wait a minute and
try the request again.
You just deployed and tested an API in Endpoints!
Note : If you want to let us know what you liked about this
tutorial, feel free to provide feedback at the bottom of this page. Your feedback helps us improve
these tutorials.
If you got an error, join the
google-cloud-endpoints
Google group and let us know what went wrong. This group receives responses from other
Endpoints users and from Google engineers, who monitor the group.
Tracking API activity
With APIs deployed with Endpoints, you can monitor critical
operations metrics in the Google Cloud console, and gain insight into your
users and usage with Cloud Logging.
In Cloud Shell, run the traffic generation script to populate the
graphs and logs:
./generate_traffic.sh
Note: This script generates requests in a loop and automatically times out
in 5 minutes. To end the script sooner, enter `Control+C` in
Cloud Shell.
In the Google Cloud console, look at the activity graphs for your API.
Go to the Endpoints Services page
It might take a few moments for the requests to be reflected in the graphs.
While you wait for data to be displayed:
If the Permissions side panel isn't open, click +Permissions .
The Permissions panel lets you
control who has access
to your API and the level of access.
Click Deployment history . This tab displays a history of your
API deployments, including the deployment time and who deployed the
change.
Click Overview . You see the traffic coming in. After the traffic
generation script has been running for a minute, you see three lines
on the Total latency graph (50th, 95th, and 98th percentiles). This
data provides an estimate of response times.
Below the graphs, and under Links ,
click View Logs for GET/airportName . The Logs Explorer page
displays the request logs for the API.
Open Cloud Shell.
Open Cloud Shell
To stop the script, enter Control+C .
Adding a quota to the API
Beta
This feature is
subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
Terms .
Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions .
Endpoints lets you set quotas that let you control the rate at
which applications can call your API. You can use quotas to protect your API
from excessive usage by a single client.
In Cloud Shell, deploy the Endpoints configuration
that has a quota.
./deploy_api.sh ../openapi_with_ratelimit.yaml
After you deploy an updated Endpoints configuration, it
becomes active within a minute.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Credentials page.
Go to the Credentials page
Click Create credentials , and then click API key . A new API key is
displayed on the screen.
Click Copy file_copy .
In Cloud Shell, type the following. Replace
YOUR_API_KEY with the API key you
just created.
export API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
Send your API a request using the API key you just generated.
./query_api_with_key.sh $API_KEY
The output is similar to the following:
curl -H 'x-api-key: AIzeSyDbdQdaSdhPMdiAuddd_FALbY7JevoMzAB' "https://example-project.appspot.com/airportName?iataCode=SFO"
San Francisco International Airport
The API now has a limit of 5 requests per minute. Run the following command
to send traffic to the API and trigger the quota limit.
./generate_traffic_with_key.sh $API_KEY
After running the script for 5-10 seconds, enter Control+C to stop the script.
Send another authenticated request to the API.
./query_api_with_key.sh $API_KEY
The output is similar to the following:
{
"code": 8,
"message": "Insufficient tokens for quota 'airport_requests' and limit 'limit-on-airport-requests' of service 'example-project.appspot.com' for consumer 'api_key:AIzeSyDbdQdaSdhPMdiAuddd_FALbY7JevoMzAB'.",
"details": [
{
"@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.DebugInfo",
"stackEntries": [],
"detail": "internal"
}
]
}
If you get a different response, try running the generate_traffic_with_key.sh
script again and then retry.
Congratulations! You've successfully rate-limited your API. You can also set
varying limits on different API methods, create multiple kinds of quotas, and
keep track of which consumers use which APIs.
For more information, see
About quotas .
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
the resources used on this page, follow these steps.
To avoid incurring charges, you can delete your Google Cloud project to stop
billing for all the resources used within that project.
Caution : Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for
the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
want to delete, and then click Delete .
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down to delete the project.
