December 19, 2024
Announcement
Version 1.0.15 of the endpoints-management-java Java library is available.
This release fixes an issue where new fields in the Google Service Configuration causes the Endpoints Frameworks Java library to fail when parsing the service configuration. Errors similar the following will appear when using new service configurations created after December 5th, 2024:
ServiceConfigException: Failed to parse the HTTP response as service configuration
We recommend that you upgrade to the 1.0.15 version to avoid these errors. This includes updating any references to the following dependencies:
com.google.endpoints:endpoints-management-control-appengine-all
com.google.endpoints:endpoints-management-control-appengine
com.google.endpoints:endpoints-framework-auth
com.google.endpoints:endpoints-management-config
com.google.endpoints:endpoints-management-api-client
com.google.endpoints:endpoints-management-control
com.google.endpoints:endpoints-management-control-all
When possible, we recommend that you use the endpoints-management-control-appengine-all version of the library to
ensure that all dependencies are properly included. However, if you have a specific dependency on endpoints-management-control-appengine and cannot use the endpoints-management-control-appengine-all version, or you are upgrading from version 1.0.11 or older, you must add the following additional dependencies to your project:
com.google.apis:google-api-services-servicemanagement version v1-rev14-1.22.0
com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java-util version 3.9.1
