Create short-lived credentials for a service account
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to create short-lived credentials for a service account,
which you can use to impersonate the service account . Depending
on the type of token you create, the short-lived token provides the identity
(for ID tokens) or permissions (for access tokens) associated with the service
account.
If your system architecture requires you to use a series of token generation
calls, you can use a delegation chain consisting of several service
accounts . In most cases, the direct method, as explained
on this page, is sufficient.
Before you begin
Enable the IAM and Service Account Credentials APIs:
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the
serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com iamcredentials.googleapis.com
Set up authentication.
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Console
When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
gcloud
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Go
To use the Go samples on this page in a local development environment, install and
initialize the gcloud CLI, and then set up Application Default Credentials with
your user credentials.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .

sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
For more information, see
Authenticate for using REST
in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.
Understand IAM service accounts .
Understand service account impersonation .
Understand what kind of token you need, and use the appropriate steps provided
in the sections below:
OAuth 2.0 access tokens
OpenID Connect (OIDC) ID tokens
Self-signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
Self-signed binary blobs
Create a short-lived access token
Access tokens are accepted for authentication by most Google APIs. When
you generate an access token by using service account impersonation, the
access token comes without a refresh token, which means that when the
token expires, you must repeat the impersonation process to generate a new
one.
For more information, see Access tokens .
To create a short-lived access token, complete these tasks:
Provide the required permissions to the caller .
Generate the access token .
Provide required permissions
A direct request involves two identities: the caller
that requests the credential, and the service account for which the
credential is created. How you set up the permissions depends on whether the
caller is authenticating as a service account or as a user account.
If you want to run a REST or gcloud CLI command on this page in a
local development environment, the caller can be represented by user
credentials. For automated workloads, such as an application running on
Compute Engine, the caller must be represented by a service account.
Service account
When the calling application uses a service account as its identity, the
following principals are involved:
Caller service account ( CALLER_SA )
This service account represents the calling application,
which issues the request for the short-lived credentials.
Privilege-bearing service account ( PRIV_SA )
This service account is granted the IAM roles needed for
the short-lived token. This is the service account for which the
short-lived token is created.
Note: In most cases, if you're using short-lived credentials to
authenticate the caller service account, the caller service account and the
privilege-bearing service account can't be the same. For more information, see
Self-impersonation .
To give CALLER_SA permissions to create short-lived
credentials for PRIV_SA , you grant
CALLER_SA the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ) on PRIV_SA .
Grant the required role on PRIV_SA :
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service Accounts page.
Go to Service Accounts
Select a project.
Click the email address of the privilege-bearing service account,
PRIV_SA .
Click the Permissions tab.
Under Principals with access to this service account , click
person_add
Grant Access .
Enter the email address of the caller service account,
CALLER_SA .
For example, demo@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Select the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ).
Click Save to grant the role to the service account.
gcloud
The
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding
command grants a role on a service account.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
PRIV_SA : The email address of the privilege-bearing
service account for which the token is generated.
CALLER_SA : The email address of the
service account representing the application that is requesting the short-lived token.
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA \
--member = serviceAccount: CALLER_SA --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator --format = json
Windows (PowerShell)
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA `
--member = serviceAccount: CALLER_SA --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator --format = json
Windows (cmd.exe)
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA ^
--member = serviceAccount: CALLER_SA --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator --format = json
You should receive a response similar to the following:
Updated IAM policy for serviceAccount [ PRIV_SA ].
{
"bindings": [
{
"members": [
"serviceAccount: CALLER_SA "
],
"role": "roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
}
],
"etag": "BwXhCB4eyjY=",

The response contains the updated allow policy.
Note: If you treat policies as code and store them in a version-control system, you should
store the policy that is returned, not the policy that you sent in the request.
User credentials
When you want to use the Google Cloud CLI to generate short-lived tokens,
or you want to generate short-lived tokens from a local development environment,
you can use a user account to generate the tokens. Often, you can use your own
user account.
When you use a user account to generate short-lived tokens, the following
identities are involved:
Caller account ( CALLER_ACCOUNT )
This user account is used to generate short-lived credentials for the
privilege-bearing service account.
Privilege-bearing service account ( PRIV_SA )
This service account is granted the IAM roles needed for
the short-lived token. This is the service account for which the
short-lived token is created.
To enable CALLER_ACCOUNT to create short-lived
credentials for PRIV_SA , you grant
CALLER_ACCOUNT the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ) on PRIV_SA .
Grant the required role on PRIV_SA :
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service Accounts page.
Go to Service Accounts
Select a project.
Click the email address of the privilege-bearing service account,
PRIV_SA .
Click the Permissions tab.
Under Principals with access to this service account , click
person_add
Grant Access .
Enter the principal identifier of the caller account,
CALLER_ACCOUNT .
For example, my-user@example.com .
Select the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ).
Click Save to grant the role to the user account.
gcloud
The
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding
command grants a role on a service account.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
PRIV_SA : The email address of the privilege-bearing
service account for which the token is generated.
CALLER_ACCOUNT : The email address of the
user account being used to request the short-lived token.
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA \
--member = user: CALLER_ACCOUNT --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator --format = json
Windows (PowerShell)
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA `
--member = user: CALLER_ACCOUNT --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator --format = json
Windows (cmd.exe)
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA ^
--member = user: CALLER_ACCOUNT --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator --format = json
You should receive a response similar to the following:

Generate the access token
You can generate an OAuth 2.0 access token by using the gcloud CLI,
the REST API, or the Cloud Client Libraries and Google API Client Libraries.
If you use the REST API, and your system is configured to allow extended
token lifetimes, you can create a token with a lifetime longer than the default.
The Google Cloud CLI does not support setting a lifetime for the token.
The samples below are designed to be used in a local development environment;
the caller must be represented by a user account, rather than a service account.
Generate an OAuth 2.0 access token for a service account:
gcloud
Ensure that you are signed into the gcloud CLI
with the caller user account.
Generate a token for the service account by using the gcloud auth
print-access-token command.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
PRIV_SA : The email address of the privilege-bearing service account for
which the short-lived token is created.
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
gcloud auth print-access-token --impersonate-service-account = PRIV_SA
Windows (PowerShell)
gcloud auth print-access-token --impersonate-service-account = PRIV_SA
Windows (cmd.exe)
gcloud auth print-access-token --impersonate-service-account = PRIV_SA
You should receive a response similar to the following:
WARNING: This command is using service account impersonation. All API calls will be executed as

Create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) ID token
ID tokens follow the
OpenID Connect (OIDC) specification . ID tokens are
accepted by a limited number of services and applications.
For more information, see ID tokens and
Authentication for applications hosted on Cloud Run or Cloud Run functions .
To create an ID token, complete these tasks:
Provide the required permissions to the caller .
Use the Service Account OpenID Connect Identity Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator ) for creating an ID
token. This is a different role than the role you use for other token
types.
Generate the ID token .
Provide required permissions
A direct request involves two identities: the caller
that requests the credential, and the service account for which the
credential is created. How you set up the permissions depends on whether the
caller is authenticating as a service account or as a user account.
If you want to run a REST or gcloud CLI command on this page in a
local development environment, the caller can be represented by user
credentials. For automated workloads, such as an application running on
Compute Engine, the caller must be represented by a service account.
Service account
When the calling application uses a service account as its identity, the
following principals are involved:
Caller service account ( CALLER_SA )
This service account represents the calling application,
which issues the request for the short-lived credentials.
Privilege-bearing service account ( PRIV_SA )
This service account is granted the IAM roles needed for
the short-lived token. This is the service account for which the
short-lived token is created.
Note: In most cases, if you're using short-lived credentials to
authenticate the caller service account, the caller service account and the
privilege-bearing service account can't be the same. For more information, see
Self-impersonation .
To give CALLER_SA permissions to create short-lived
credentials for PRIV_SA , you grant
CALLER_SA the Service Account OpenID Connect Identity Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator ) on PRIV_SA .
Grant the required role on PRIV_SA :
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service Accounts page.
Go to Service Accounts
Select a project.
Click the email address of the privilege-bearing service account,
PRIV_SA .
Click the Permissions tab.
Under Principals with access to this service account , click
person_add
Grant Access .
Enter the email address of the caller service account,
CALLER_SA .
For example, demo@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Select the Service Account OpenID Connect Identity Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator ).
Click Save to grant the role to the service account.
gcloud
The
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding
command grants a role on a service account.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
PRIV_SA : The email address of the privilege-bearing
service account for which the token is generated.
CALLER_SA : The email address of the
service account representing the application that is requesting the short-lived token.
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA \
--member = serviceAccount: CALLER_SA --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator --format = json
Windows (PowerShell)
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA `
--member = serviceAccount: CALLER_SA --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator --format = json
Windows (cmd.exe)
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA ^
--member = serviceAccount: CALLER_SA --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator --format = json
You should receive a response similar to the following:
Updated IAM policy for serviceAccount [ PRIV_SA ].
{
"bindings": [
{
"members": [
"serviceAccount: CALLER_SA "
],
"role": "roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator"
}
],

User credentials
When you want to use the Google Cloud CLI to generate short-lived tokens,
or you want to generate short-lived tokens from a local development environment,
you can use a user account to generate the tokens. Often, you can use your own
user account.
When you use a user account to generate short-lived tokens, the following
identities are involved:
Caller account ( CALLER_ACCOUNT )
This user account is used to generate short-lived credentials for the
privilege-bearing service account.
Privilege-bearing service account ( PRIV_SA )
This service account is granted the IAM roles needed for
the short-lived token. This is the service account for which the
short-lived token is created.
To enable CALLER_ACCOUNT to create short-lived
credentials for PRIV_SA , you grant
CALLER_ACCOUNT the Service Account OpenID Connect Identity Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator ) on PRIV_SA .
Grant the required role on PRIV_SA :
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service Accounts page.
Go to Service Accounts
Select a project.
Click the email address of the privilege-bearing service account,
PRIV_SA .
Click the Permissions tab.
Under Principals with access to this service account , click
person_add
Grant Access .
Enter the principal identifier of the caller account,
CALLER_ACCOUNT .
For example, my-user@example.com .
Select the Service Account OpenID Connect Identity Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator ).
Click Save to grant the role to the user account.
gcloud
The
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding
command grants a role on a service account.
Before using any of the command data below,

PRIV_SA : The email address of the privilege-bearing
service account for which the token is generated.
CALLER_ACCOUNT : The email address of the
user account being used to request the short-lived token.
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA \
--member = user: CALLER_ACCOUNT --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator --format = json
Windows (PowerShell)
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA `

Generate the ID token
You can generate an OpenID Connect (OIDC) ID token by using the
gcloud CLI, the REST API, or the Cloud Client Libraries and
Google API Client Libraries.
The samples below are designed to be used in a local development environment;
the caller must be represented by a user account, rather than a service account.
OIDC ID tokens are valid for 1 hour
(3,600 seconds).
Generate a Google-signed OIDC ID token for a service account:
gcloud
Ensure that you are signed into the gcloud CLI
with the caller user account.
Generate a token for the service account by using the gcloud auth
print-identity-token command.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
PRIV_SA : The email address of the privilege-bearing service account for
which the short-lived token is created.
AUDIENCE_NAME : The audience for the token, usually the URL of the
application or service that the token will be used to access.
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
gcloud auth print-identity-token --impersonate-service-account = PRIV_SA --audiences = " AUDIENCE_NAME "
Windows (PowerShell)
gcloud auth print-identity-token --impersonate-service-account = PRIV_SA --audiences = " AUDIENCE_NAME "
Windows (cmd.exe)
gcloud auth print-identity-token --impersonate-service-account = PRIV_SA --audiences = " AUDIENCE_NAME "
You should receive a response similar to the following:

authenticate a request on behalf of the service account:
{
"token": "eyJ0eXAi...NiJ9"
}
Create a self-signed JSON Web Token (JWT)
Self-signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are useful in a variety of scenarios:
Securely communicating between your own applications. In this scenario, one
application can sign a token that can be verified by another application for
authentication purposes.
Authenticating a call to a Google API as described in
Service account authorization without OAuth .
Authenticating to an API deployed with API Gateway.
Treating a service account as an identity provider by signing a JWT that
contains arbitrary claims about a user, account, or device.
To create a JWT, complete these tasks:
Provide the required permissions to the caller .
Generate the JWT .
Provide required permissions
A direct request involves two identities: the caller
that requests the credential, and the service account for which the
credential is created. How you set up the permissions depends on whether the
caller is authenticating as a service account or as a user account.
If you want to run a REST or gcloud CLI command on this page in a
local development environment, the caller can be represented by user
credentials. For automated workloads, such as an application running on
Compute Engine, the caller must be represented by a service account.
Service account
When the calling application uses a service account as its identity, the
following principals are involved:
Caller service account ( CALLER_SA )
This service account represents the calling application,
which issues the request for the short-lived credentials.
Privilege-bearing service account ( PRIV_SA )
This service account is granted the IAM roles needed for
the short-lived token. This is the service account for which the
short-lived token is created.
Note: In most cases, if you're using short-lived credentials to
authenticate the caller service account, the caller service account and the
privilege-bearing service account can't be the same. For more information, see
Self-impersonation .
To give CALLER_SA permissions to create short-lived
credentials for PRIV_SA , you grant
CALLER_SA the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ) on PRIV_SA .
Grant the required role on PRIV_SA :
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service Accounts page.
Go to Service Accounts
Select a project.
Click the email address of the privilege-bearing service account,
PRIV_SA .
Click the Permissions tab.
Under Principals with access to this service account , click
person_add
Grant Access .
Enter the email address of the caller service account,
CALLER_SA .
For example, demo@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Select the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ).
Click Save to grant the role to the service account.
gcloud
The
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding
command grants a role on a service account.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
PRIV_SA : The email address of the privilege-bearing
service account for which the token is generated.
CALLER_SA : The email address of the
service account representing the application that is requesting the short-lived token.
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA \
--member = serviceAccount: CALLER_SA --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator --format = json
Windows (PowerShell)

User credentials
When you want to use the Google Cloud CLI to generate short-lived tokens,
or you want to generate short-lived tokens from a local development environment,
you can use a user account to generate the tokens. Often, you can use your own
user account.
When you use a user account to generate short-lived tokens, the following
identities are involved:
Caller account ( CALLER_ACCOUNT )
This user account is used to generate short-lived credentials for the
privilege-bearing service account.
Privilege-bearing service account ( PRIV_SA )
This service account is granted the IAM roles needed for
the short-lived token. This is the service account for which the
short-lived token is created.
To enable CALLER_ACCOUNT to create short-lived
credentials for PRIV_SA , you grant
CALLER_ACCOUNT the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ) on PRIV_SA .
Grant the required role on PRIV_SA :
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service Accounts page.
Go to Service Accounts
Select a project.
Click the email address of the privilege-bearing service account,
PRIV_SA .
Click the Permissions tab.

If the signJwt request was successful, the response body contains a signed JWT and
the signing key ID that was used to sign the JWT. You can use the signedJwt value as
a bearer token to directly authenticate a request on behalf of the service account. The token is
valid up to the expiration time specified in the request:
{
"keyId": "42ba1e...fc0a",
"signedJwt": "eyJ0eXAi...NiJ9"
}
Create a self-signed binary object (blob)
Self-signed binary objects, or blobs, are used to transmit binary data in such a
way that the originator of the data is known (because the blob is self-signed).
Blobs can be used to create signatures, a Cloud Storage object required for
various authentication flows including signed URLs. For information about
signatures, see the Cloud Storage documentation .
To create a self-signed binary object, complete these tasks:
Provide the required permissions to the caller .
Generate the self-signed blob .
Provide required permissions
A direct request involves two identities: the caller
that requests the credential, and the service account for which the
credential is created. How you set up the permissions depends on whether the
caller is authenticating as a service account or as a user account.
If you want to run a REST or gcloud CLI command on this page in a
local development environment, the caller can be represented by user
credentials. For automated workloads, such as an application running on
Compute Engine, the caller must be represented by a service account.
Service account
When the calling application uses a service account as its identity, the
following principals are involved:
Caller service account ( CALLER_SA )
This service account represents the calling application,
which issues the request for the short-lived credentials.
Privilege-bearing service account ( PRIV_SA )
This service account is granted the IAM roles needed for
the short-lived token. This is the service account for which the
short-lived token is created.
Note: In most cases, if you're using short-lived credentials to
authenticate the caller service account, the caller service account and the
privilege-bearing service account can't be the same. For more information, see
Self-impersonation .
To give CALLER_SA permissions to create short-lived
credentials for PRIV_SA , you grant
CALLER_SA the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ) on PRIV_SA .
Grant the required role on PRIV_SA :
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service Accounts page.
Go to Service Accounts
Select a project.
Click the email address of the privilege-bearing service account,
PRIV_SA .
Click the Permissions tab.
Under Principals with access to this service account , click
person_add
Grant Access .
Enter the email address of the caller service account,
CALLER_SA .
For example, demo@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
Select the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ).
Click Save to grant the role to the service account.
gcloud
The
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding
command grants a role on a service account.
Before using any of the command data below,
make the following replacements:
PRIV_SA : The email address of the privilege-bearing
service account for which the token is generated.
CALLER_SA : The email address of the
service account representing the application that is requesting the short-lived token.
Execute the
following
command:
Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA \
--member = serviceAccount: CALLER_SA --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator --format = json
Windows (PowerShell)
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA `
--member = serviceAccount: CALLER_SA --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator --format = json
Windows (cmd.exe)
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding PRIV_SA ^
--member = serviceAccount: CALLER_SA --role = roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator --format = json
You should receive a response similar to the following:
Updated IAM policy for serviceAccount [ PRIV_SA ].
{
"bindings": [
{
"members": [
"serviceAccount: CALLER_SA "
],
"role": "roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"

User credentials
When you want to use the Google Cloud CLI to generate short-lived tokens,
or you want to generate short-lived tokens from a local development environment,
you can use a user account to generate the tokens. Often, you can use your own
user account.
When you use a user account to generate short-lived tokens, the following
identities are involved:
Caller account ( CALLER_ACCOUNT )
This user account is used to generate short-lived credentials for the
privilege-bearing service account.
Privilege-bearing service account ( PRIV_SA )
This service account is granted the IAM roles needed for
the short-lived token. This is the service account for which the
short-lived token is created.
To enable CALLER_ACCOUNT to create short-lived
credentials for PRIV_SA , you grant
CALLER_ACCOUNT the Service Account Token Creator role
( roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator ) on PRIV_SA .
Grant the required role on PRIV_SA :
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Service Accounts page.
Go to Service Accounts
Select a project.
Click the email address of the privilege-bearing service account,
PRIV_SA .
Click the Permissions tab.
Under Principals with access to this service account , click
person_add
