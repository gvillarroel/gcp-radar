Overview of IAM Conditions
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes the Conditions feature of Identity and Access Management (IAM).
You can use IAM Conditions to define and enforce conditional,
attribute-based access control for Google Cloud resources.
Conditions and policy types
You can use conditions in the following places:
Allow policy role bindings, including role bindings managed by
Privileged Access Manager entitlements
Deny policy rules
Policy bindings for principal access boundary policies
The following sections describe how you can use conditions in each of these
places to enforce attribute-based access control.
Conditions in allow policies
Note: You cannot use conditions when you grant
legacy basic roles , including Owner
( roles/owner ), Editor ( roles/editor ), and Viewer
( roles/viewer ). Also, you cannot use conditions when you grant roles to all users
( allUsers ) or all authenticated users
( allAuthenticatedUsers ).
You can use conditions in allow policies to choose to grant
access to principals only if specified conditions are met. For example, you
could grant temporary access to users so they can resolve a production issue, or
you could grant access only to employees making requests from your corporate
network.
Conditions are specified in the role bindings of a resource's allow policy. If a
role binding has a condition, then the principals in the role are only granted
the role if the condition expression evaluates to true .
Note: Conditional role bindings do not override role bindings with no conditions. If a
principal is bound to a role, and the role binding does not have a condition, then the principal
always has that role. Adding the principal to a conditional binding for the same role has no
effect.
To add a condition to a role binding, you define the condition field:
"bindings" : [
{
"role" : " ROLE " ,
"members" : [
" MEMBER_1 " ,
" MEMBER_2 "
],
"condition" : {
"title" : " TITLE " ,
"description" : " DESCRIPTION " ,
"expression" : " EXPRESSION "
}
}
]
If you're using Privileged Access Manager entitlements, you can also add conditions
to the roles in that entitlement. When a user successfully requests a grant
for that entitlement, they are granted the role with the specified condition.
To learn more about the fields in a condition, see Condition
structure on this page.
Only some resource types
accept conditions in role bindings .
However, you can
grant conditional access to other resource types by
granting roles at the organization or project level.
Note: To use conditions in the allow policy for a Cloud Storage bucket, you
must
enable uniform bucket-level access
on the bucket. If you cannot enable uniform bucket-level access, you can add
conditional role grants to the allow policy for a higher-level resource, such as
the project that contains the bucket. The bucket inherits the role grants from
the project.
As a best practice, don't add more than
100 conditional role bindings to a
single allow policy. If you use a larger number of conditional role bindings,
you might exceed the overall size limit for allow policies.
To learn how to add, modify, and remove conditional role bindings, see
Managing conditional role bindings .
Conditions in deny policies
You can use conditions in deny policies to apply a deny rule
only if a certain condition is met. For example, you could deny a permission
only if the resource that the principal is trying to access is tagged as a part
of the prod environment.
Conditions are specified in the deny rules in a resource's deny policies. If the
condition evaluates to true or cannot be evaluated, the deny rule applies and
the principals are unable to use the specified permissions. If the condition
evaluates to false , the deny rule does not apply and the principals can use
the specified permissions if they have them.
Conditions in deny policies have the same structure as conditions in allow
policies; however, they only recognize resource tag
functions .
To add a condition to a deny rule, you define the denialCondition field:
"rules" : [
{
"denyRule" : {
"deniedPrincipals" : [
" PRINCIPAL_1 " ,
" PRINCIPAL_2 "
],
"exceptionPrincipals" : [
" EXCEPTION_PRINCIPAL_1 " ,
" EXCEPTION_PRINCIPAL_2 "
],
"deniedPermissions" : [
" DENIED_PERMISSION_1 " ,
" DENIED_PERMISSION_2 "
],
"denialCondition" : {
"title" : " TITLE " ,
"description" : " DESCRIPTION " ,
"expression" : " EXPRESSION "
}
}
}
]
To learn more about the fields in a condition, see Condition
structure on this page.
To learn how to create and manage deny policies, see Deny access .
Conditions in principal access boundary policy bindings
You can use conditions in policy bindings for principal access boundary
policies to refine the principal set that the
principal access boundary policy applies to. For example, you could only enforce a
policy for service accounts, or exempt super-admin@example.com from a policy.
Conditions are specified in each policy binding. If a policy binding has a
condition, then the policy in the policy binding is enforced only if the
condition evaluates to true .
To add a condition to a policy binding, you define the condition field in the
policy binding:
{
"displayName" : " DISPLAY_NAME " ,
"target" : {
"principalSet" : " PRINCIPAL_SET "
},
"policyKind" : "PRINCIPAL_ACCESS_BOUNDARY" ,
"policy" : " PAB_POLICY " ,
"condition" : {
"title" : " TITLE " ,
"description" : " DESCRIPTION " ,
"expression" : " EXPRESSION "
}
}
To learn more about the fields in a condition, see Condition
structure on this page.
To learn how to create policy bindings for principal access boundary policies, see
Apply a principal access boundary policy to a principal set .
Condition structure
The condition object has the following structure:
"condition" : {
"title" : ... ,
"description" : ... ,
"expression" : ...
}
The condition's title is required, but the description is optional. Both the
title and description are purely informational fields to help you identify and
describe the condition.
The expression field is required. It defines an attribute-based
logic expression using a subset of the Common Expression Language (CEL) .
The condition expression can contain multiple statements; each statement
evaluates one attribute. Statements are combined using logical operators,
following the CEL language specification.
CEL for conditions
Common Expression Language, or CEL, is the expression language used to specify
an expression in IAM Conditions. It is tailored to express
attribute-based logic expressions. For more information, see the
CEL spec and its language
definition .
In IAM Conditions, a subset of CEL is used to make boolean
authorization decisions based on attribute data. In general, a condition
expression consists of one or more statements that are joined by logical
operators ( && , || , or ! ).
Each statement expresses an attribute-based control rule, and ultimately
determines whether the role binding, deny rule, or policy binding applies.
Conditions in IAM Conditions use the following CEL features:
Variables : Conditions use variables to express a given attribute, such as
request.time (of type Timestamp) or resource.name (of type String). These
variables are populated with value based on the context at runtime.
Operators : Every data type, such as Timestamp or String, supports a set
of operators that can be used to create a logic expression. Most commonly,
operators are used to compare the value contained in a variable with a literal
value, such as
resource.service == 'compute.googleapis.com' . In this example, if the input
value of resource.service is compute.googleapis.com , then the expression
evaluates to true .
Functions : A function is a compound operator for data types that support
more complex operations. In condition expressions, there are predefined
functions that can be used with a given data type. For example,
request.path.startsWith('/finance') uses a String prefix
match function, and evaluates to true if the value of request.path
contains a matching prefix, such as /finance .
Logical operators : Conditions supports three logical operators that can be
used to build complex logic expressions from basic expression statements:
&& , || , and ! . These logical operators make it possible to use multiple
input variables in a condition expression. For example:
request.time.getFullYear() < 2020 && resource.service == 'compute.googleapis.com'
joins two basic statements, and requires both statements to be met in order
to produce a true overall evaluation result.
For more information about supported variables, operators, and functions, see
the attribute reference .
Condition attributes
Condition attributes are based on the requested resource—for example,
its type or name—or on details about the request—for example, its timestamp or
destination IP address.
The condition attributes that you can use in a condition expression depend on
the policy type that you're writing conditions for. For a full list of condition
attributes and more information about
the attributes supported for each policy type, see the attribute
reference .
The following sections show examples of some of the attributes that you can
use in conditions.
Resource attributes
You can use resource attributes to write conditions that evaluate the resource
in the access request. The attributes that you can evaluate include the
following:
The resource type
The resource name
The Google Cloud service being used
The tags attached to the resource
You can use any of these attributes in allow policy role bindings. Additionally,
you can use the resource tags attribute in deny policy deny rules.
For a complete list of resource attributes, see the
resource attributes reference .
To learn how to use resource attributes to configure resource-based access, see
Configuring resource-based access .
Example expressions
In a role binding, the following condition expression allows access
to Compute Engine VM instances, but no other type of resource:
resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance'
In a role binding, the following condition expression allows access
to Cloud Storage resources, but no other service's resources:
resource.service == 'storage.googleapis.com'
In a role binding, the following condition expression allows access
only to Cloud Storage objects inside a specific bucket:
resource.type == 'storage.googleapis.com/Object' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/_/buckets/exampleco-site-assets/')
In a deny rule, the following condition expression denies access to
Google Cloud resources that have the tag env: prod :
resource.matchTag('123456789012/env', 'prod')
Principal attributes
The principal attributes let you write conditions based on the principal that
issued the request. The attributes that you can evaluate include the following:
The type of principal in the request
The identity of the principal in the request
You can use these attributes in policy bindings for principal access boundary policies.
For details, see the conditions attribute
reference .
Example expressions
In a principal access boundary policy binding, the following condition expression
ensures that the policy in the binding is only enforced for service accounts:
principal.type == 'iam.googleapis.com/ServiceAccount'
In a principal access boundary policy binding, the following condition expression
ensures that the policy in the binding isn't enforced for
super-admin@example.com :
principal.subject != 'super-admin@example.com'
Request attributes
You can use request attributes to write conditions that evaluate details about
the request, such as the following:
The access level
The date and time
The destination IP address and port (for IAP TCP tunneling)
The expected URL host or path (for IAP)
You can use these attributes in allow policy role bindings.
Example access level expression (for IAP only)
In the following example, your organization defines an access level, CorpNet ,
that limits access to the range of IP addresses where traffic enters and exits a
corporate network. Then, you add the following condition expression to a role
binding to allow access only if the request meets the CorpNet access level:
'accessPolicies/199923665455/accessLevels/CorpNet' in
request.auth.access_levels
Your organization defines access levels based on attributes of the request, such
as origin IP address, device attributes, the time of day, and more. For more
details, see the Access Context Manager documentation .
Example API attribute expression
In a role binding for a role with the iam.projects.setIamPolicy
permission, the following condition expression allows a user to grant and revoke
only the Billing Account Administrator ( roles/billing.admin ) role on the
project:
api.getAttribute('iam.googleapis.com/modifiedGrantsByRole', [])
.hasOnly(['roles/billing.admin'])
To learn more about using API attributes to limit role granting, see
Setting limits on granting roles .
Example date/time expressions
In a role binding, the following condition expression allows access
until midnight on January 1st, 2021:
request.time < timestamp('2021-01-01T00:00:00Z')
In a role binding, the following condition expression allows access
only during specified working hours, based on the time zone for Berlin, Germany:
request.time.getHours('Europe/Berlin') >= 9 &&
request.time.getHours('Europe/Berlin') <= 17 &&
// Days of the week range from 0 to 6, where 0 == Sunday and 6 == Saturday.
request.time.getDayOfWeek('Europe/Berlin') >= 1 &&
request.time.getDayOfWeek('Europe/Berlin') <= '
In a role binding, the following condition expression allows access
only for June of 2020, based on the time zone for Berlin, Germany:
request.time.getFullYear('Europe/Berlin') == 2020
request.time.getMonth('Europe/Berlin') < 6
To specify a timestamp, use RFC 3339
format. To specify a time zone, use the identifiers in the
IANA Time Zone Database .
For more details about date/time expressions, see the
CEL specification .
To learn how to use date/time expressions to configure temporary
access, see Configuring temporary access .
Example destination IP and port expressions (for IAP TCP tunneling)
In a role binding, the following condition expression allows access
to an internal destination IP address or port number:
destination.ip == '14.0.0.1'
destination.ip != '127.0.0.1'
destination.port == 22
destination.port > 21 && destination.port <= 23
Example forwarding rule expressions
In a role binding, the following condition expression allows access
for a principal if the request is not creating a forwarding rule, or if the
request is creating a forwarding rule for an internal Google Cloud load
balancer:
!compute.isForwardingRuleCreationOperation() || (
compute.isForwardingRuleCreationOperation() &&
compute.matchLoadBalancingSchemes([
'INTERNAL', 'INTERNAL_MANAGED', 'INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED'
])
)
For details about load-balancing schemes, see
Using IAM Conditions on Google Cloud load balancers .
Example URL host or path expressions (for IAP)
In a role binding, the following condition expression allows access
only for certain subdomains or URL paths in the request:
request.host == 'hr.example.com'
request.host.endsWith('.example.com')
request.path == '/admin/payroll.js'
request.path.startsWith('/admin')
Example expression with different types of attributes
In a role binding, the following condition expression allows access
if the request is made during a specific time, matching a resource name prefix,
with the chosen access level, and for a specific resource type:
request.time > timestamp('2018-08-03T16:00:00-07:00') &&
request.time < timestamp('2018-08-03T16:05:00-07:00') &&
((resource.name.startsWith('projects/project-123/zones/us-east1-b/instances/dev') ||
(resource.name.startsWith('projects/project-123/zones/us-east1-b/instances/prod') &&
'accessPolicies/34569256/accessLevels/CorpNet' in request.auth.access_levels)) ||
resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance')
