Deny access to resources
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page explains how to deny principals access by preventing them from using
specific Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions.
In IAM, you deny access with deny policies . Each deny policy is
attached to a Google Cloud organization, folder, or project. A deny policy
contains deny rules , which identify principals and list the permissions that
the principals cannot use.
Deny policies are separate from allow policies , also known as
IAM policies . An allow policy provides access to resources by
granting IAM roles to principals.
You can manage deny policies with the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI,
or the IAM v2 REST API.
Before you begin
Enable the IAM API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the API
Set up authentication.
Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
Console
When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and
APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
gcloud
In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
Activate Cloud Shell
At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a
Cloud Shell
session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment
with the Google Cloud CLI
already installed and with values already set for
your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
Terraform
To use the Terraform samples on this page in a local development environment, install and
initialize the gcloud CLI, and then set up Application Default Credentials with
your user credentials.
Install the Google Cloud CLI.
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
account:
gcloud auth application-default login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
(IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity .

Read the overview of deny policies .
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to manage deny policies,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles on the organization:
To view deny policies:
Deny Reviewer ( roles/iam.denyReviewer )
To view, create, update, and delete deny policies:
Deny Admin ( roles/iam.denyAdmin )
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to manage deny policies. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to manage deny policies:
To view deny policies:
iam.denypolicies.get
iam.denypolicies.list
To create, update, and delete deny policies:
iam.denypolicies.create
iam.denypolicies.delete
iam.denypolicies.get
iam.denypolicies.update
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Identify permissions to deny
Before you create a deny policy, you must decide which permissions you want to
deny, and which principals should be denied these permissions.
Only some permissions can be denied. For a list of permissions that you can
deny, see Permissions supported in deny policies .
In some cases, you can also use permission groups to deny sets of permissions.
For more information, see Permission groups .
You manage deny policies with the v2 REST API, which requires a special format
for permission names. For example, the permission to create an
IAM custom role is named as follows:
v1 API: iam.roles.create
v2 API: iam.googleapis.com/roles.create
Create a deny policy
You can add deny policies to organizations, folders, and projects. Each resource
can have up to 500 deny policies.
Deny policies contain deny rules, which specify the following:
The permissions to deny.
The principals that are denied those permissions.
Optional: Principals that are exempt from the denial of permissions.
For example, you can deny a permission to a group, but exempt specific users
who belong to that group.
Optional: A condition expression that specifies when
the principals cannot use the permissions. In deny policies, condition
expressions can only use functions for resource
tags —other functions and operators are not
supported.
Each resource can have up to 500 deny rules
across all of its attached deny policies.
Deny policies are inherited through the
resource hierarchy . For example, if you deny a permission
at the organization level, that permission will also be denied on the folders
and projects within that organization, and on the service-specific resources
within each project.
Deny policies override allow policies. If a principal is granted a role that
contains a specific permission, but a deny policy says that the principal cannot
use that permission, then the principal cannot use the permission.
Note:
In general, policy changes take effect within 2 minutes. However, in some cases, it
can take 7 minutes or more for changes to propagate across the system.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Deny tab on the IAM page.
Go
to IAM
Select a project, folder, or organization.
Click add_box Create deny policy .
In the Policy name section, define the policy ID by doing one of the
following:
In the Display name field, enter a display name for the policy.
Filling out this field automatically fills out the ID field. If you
want to change the ID of the policy, update the text in the ID field.
In the ID field, enter an ID for the policy.
In the Deny rules section, define the policy's deny rules. Each deny
policy must have at least one deny rule. To add additional deny rules, click
Add deny rule .
For each deny rule, do the following:
In the Denied principals field, add one or more principals that you
want to prevent from using the specified permissions. The principal can
be any of the principal types in the principal identifiers for deny
policies , except the principals whose IDs
begin with deleted: .
Optional: In the Exception principals field, add the principals that
you want to be able to use the specified permissions, even if those
principals are included in Denied principals section. For example,
you can use this field to make an exception for specific users who belong
to a denied group.
Note : If a principal set in the list of denied principals includes service
agents —for example, the principal set
principalSet://goog/public:all —then we recommend adding
your service agents as exceptions in the deny rule. This helps ensure that
your services continue to function properly.
When adding service agents as exceptions, use the project, folder, or
organization's service
agent principal set .
In the Denied permissions sections, add the permissions that you want
to deny. The permissions must be supported in deny
policies .
In some cases, you can also use permission groups to deny sets of
permissions. For more information, see Permission
groups .
Optional: Add exception permissions. Exception permissions are
permissions that you don't want this deny rule to deny, even if they're
included in the list of denied permissions. For example, you can use this
field to make exceptions for specific permissions in a permission group.
To add exception permissions, click Exception
permissions , click add Add
another permission , and then enter the permission in the Permission
1 field. Continue adding permissions until you've added all permissions
that you want to exempt from the deny policy.
Optional: Add a denial condition to specify when the principals can't use
the permission. To add a denial condition, click add Add denial condition , and then
define the following fields:
Title : Optional. A brief summary of the purpose of the condition.
Description : Optional. A longer description of the condition.
Condition expression: You can add a condition expression using the
Condition builder or Condition editor . The condition builder
provides an interactive interface to select your desired condition
type, operator, and other applicable details about the expression. The
condition editor provides a text-based interface to manually enter an
expression using Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax .
Denial conditions must be based on resource
tags . Other functions and operators aren't
supported.
Click Create .
gcloud
To create a deny policy for a resource, start by creating a JSON file that
contains the policy. A deny policy uses the following format:
{
"displayName" : " POLICY_NAME " ,
"rules" : [
{
"denyRule" : DENY_RULE_ 1
},
{
"denyRule" : DENY_RULE_ 2
},
{
"denyRule" : DENY_RULE_N
}
]
}
Provide the following values:
POLICY_NAME : The display name for the deny policy.
DENY_RULE_1 , DENY_RULE_2 ,
... DENY_RULE_N : The deny rules in the policy. Each deny rule can contain
these fields:
deniedPermissions : A list of permissions that the specified principals cannot use.
The permissions must be supported in deny
policies .
In some cases, you can also use permission groups to deny sets of permissions.
For more information, see Permission
groups .
exceptionPermissions : A list of permissions that the specified principals can use,
even if those permissions are included in deniedPermissions . For example, you can
use this field to make exceptions for specific permissions in a group of permissions.
deniedPrincipals : A list of principals that cannot use the specified permissions.
To learn how to format the principal identifiers, see Principal identifiers for deny policies .
exceptionPrincipals : Optional. A list of principals that can use the specified
permissions, even if those principals are included in deniedPrincipals . For
example, you can use this field to make an exception for specific users who belong to a denied
group. To learn how to format the principal identifiers, see Principal identifiers for deny policies .
Note : If a principal set in the list of denied principals includes service
agents —for example, the principal set
principalSet://goog/public:all —then we recommend adding
your service agents as exceptions in the deny rule. This helps ensure that
your services continue to function properly.
When adding service agents as exceptions, use the project, folder, or
organization's service
agent principal set .
denialCondition : Optional. A condition
expression that specifies when the principals cannot use the permissions. Contains the
following fields:
expression : A condition expression that uses
Common
Expression Language (CEL) syntax . The expression must use the
CEL functions for
evaluating resource tags . Other functions and operators are not supported.
title : Optional. A brief summary of the purpose of the condition.
description : Optional. A longer description of the condition.
For examples of deny rules, see Common use cases .
For example, the following deny policy contains one deny rule, which denies one
permission to Lucian:
{
"displayName" : "My deny policy." ,
"rules" : [
{
"denyRule" : {
"deniedPrincipals" : [
"principal://goog/subject/lucian@example.com"
],
"deniedPermissions" : [
"iam.googleapis.com/roles.create"
]
}
}
]
}
Next, run the gcloud iam policies create command:
gcloud iam policies create POLICY_ID \
--attachment-point = ATTACHMENT_POINT \
--kind = denypolicies \
--policy-file = POLICY_FILE
Provide the following values:
POLICY_ID : The identifier for the deny policy.
ATTACHMENT_POINT : An identifier for the resource that
the deny policy is attached to. To learn how to format this value, see
Attachment point .
POLICY_FILE : The filepath for the JSON file that
contains the deny policy.
By default, if this command succeeds, it does not print any output. To print a
detailed response, add the flag --format=json to the command.
For example, the following command creates a deny policy named my-deny-policy
for the project my-project , using a file named policy.json :
gcloud iam policies create my-deny-policy \
--attachment-point = cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/my-project \
--kind = denypolicies \
--policy-file = policy.json

REST
The
policies.createPolicy
method creates a deny policy for a resource.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
ENCODED_ATTACHMENT_POINT : A URL-encoded identifier for the resource that
the deny policy is attached to. To learn how to format this value, see
Attachment point .
POLICY_ID : An identifier for the deny policy.
POLICY_NAME : The display name for the deny
policy.
DENY_RULE_1 , DENY_RULE_2 ,
... DENY_RULE_N : The deny rules in the policy. Each deny rule can contain
these fields:
deniedPermissions : A list of permissions that the specified principals cannot use.
The permissions must be supported in deny
policies .
In some cases, you can also use permission groups to deny sets of permissions.
For more information, see Permission
groups .
exceptionPermissions : A list of permissions that the specified principals can use,
even if those permissions are included in deniedPermissions . For example, you can
use this field to make exceptions for specific permissions in a group of permissions.
deniedPrincipals : A list of principals that cannot use the specified permissions.
To learn how to format the principal identifiers, see Principal identifiers for deny policies .
exceptionPrincipals : Optional. A list of principals that can use the specified
permissions, even if those principals are included in deniedPrincipals . For
example, you can use this field to make an exception for specific users who belong to a denied
group. To learn how to format the principal identifiers, see Principal identifiers for deny policies .
Note : If a principal set in the list of denied principals includes service
agents —for example, the principal set
principalSet://goog/public:all —then we recommend adding
your service agents as exceptions in the deny rule. This helps ensure that
your services continue to function properly.
When adding service agents as exceptions, use the project, folder, or
organization's service
agent principal set .
denialCondition : Optional. A condition
expression that specifies when the principals cannot use the permissions. Contains the
following fields:
expression : A condition expression that uses
Common
Expression Language (CEL) syntax . The expression must use the
CEL functions for
evaluating resource tags . Other functions and operators are not supported.
title : Optional. A brief summary of the purpose of the condition.
description : Optional. A longer description of the condition.
For examples of deny rules, see Common use cases .

replaces the alias with the user's primary email address.
List deny policies
A resource can have multiple deny policies. You can list all of the deny
policies that are attached to a resource, and then view each deny
policy to see the deny rules in each policy.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Deny tab on the IAM page.
Go
to IAM
Select a project, folder, or organization.
The Google Cloud console lists all deny policies that apply to that
project, folder, or organization. This includes deny policies that have been
inherited from other resources. For more information about deny policy
inheritance, see Deny policy inheritance .
gcloud
To list the deny policies for a resource, run the
gcloud iam policies list command:
gcloud iam policies list \
--attachment-point = ATTACHMENT_POINT \
--kind = denypolicies \
--format = json
Provide the following value:
ATTACHMENT_POINT : An identifier for the resource that
the deny policy is attached to. To learn how to format this value, see
Attachment point .
For example, the following command lists deny policies attached to an
organization whose numeric ID is 123456789012 :
gcloud iam policies list \
--attachment-point = cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/organizations/123456789012 \
--kind = denypolicies \

In the Google Cloud console, go to the Deny tab on the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Select a project, folder, or organization.
In the Policy ID column, click the ID of the policy that you want to
view.
The Google Cloud console shows the details of the deny policy, including
the policy ID, when the policy was created, and the deny rules in the deny
policy.
gcloud
To get the deny policy for a resource, run the
gcloud iam policies get command:
gcloud iam policies get POLICY_ID \
--attachment-point = ATTACHMENT_POINT \
--kind = denypolicies \

Note: When you use an email alias in a deny policy, IAM automatically
replaces the alias with the user's primary email address.
Update a deny policy
After you create a deny policy, you can update the deny rules that it contains,
as well as its display name.
You can update a deny policy using the Google Cloud console, or using
one of the following programmatic methods:
The gcloud CLI
The REST API
The IAM client libraries
Update a deny policy using the Google Cloud console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Deny tab on the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Select a project, folder, or organization.
In the Policy ID column, click the ID of the policy that you want to
edit.
Click edit Edit .
Update the deny policy:
To change the policy display name, edit the Display name field.
To edit an existing deny rule, click the deny rule, and then modify the
rule's principals, exception principals, denied permissions, exception
permissions, or denial condition.
To remove a deny rule, find the deny rule that you want to delete, and
then click delete Delete in that
row.
To add a deny rule, click Add deny rule , and then create a deny rule
like you do when you create a deny policy .
When you're done updating the deny policy, click Save .
Update a deny policy programmatically
To update a deny policy using the gcloud CLI, the REST API, or the
IAM client libraries, use the read-modify-write pattern:
Read the current version of the policy.
Modify the information in the policy as needed.
Write the updated policy.
Read the deny policy
gcloud
To get the deny policy for a resource, run the
gcloud iam policies get command:
gcloud iam policies get POLICY_ID \
--attachment-point = ATTACHMENT_POINT \
--kind = denypolicies \
--format = json
Provide the following values:
POLICY_ID : The identifier for the deny policy.
ATTACHMENT_POINT : An identifier for the resource that
the deny policy is attached to. To learn how to format this value, see
Attachment point .
For example, the following command gets the deny policy named my-deny-policy
for the project my-project and saves it in a file named policy.json :
gcloud iam policies get my-deny-policy \
--attachment-point = cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/my-project \
--kind = denypolicies \
--format = json \
> ./policy.json

Modify the deny policy
To modify the deny policy, you make changes to the copy of the policy that you
previously read from IAM. You can update the display name, or you
can add, change, or remove deny rules. The changes don't take effect until you
write the updated policy .
Note:
In general, policy changes take effect within 2 minutes. However, in some cases, it
can take 7 minutes or more for changes to propagate across the system.
For example, you could add a permission to an existing deny rule:
{
"name" : "policies/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2F1234567890123/denypolicies/my-policy" ,
"uid" : "6665c437-a3b2-a018-6934-54dd16d3426e" ,

"displayName" : "My deny policy." ,
"etag" : "MTc3NDU4MjM4OTY0MzU5MjQ5OTI=" ,

"rules" : [
{
"denyRule" : {
"deniedPrincipals" : [
"principal://goog/subject/lucian@example.com"
],
"deniedPermissions" : [
"iam.googleapis.com/roles.create" ,
"iam.googleapis.com/roles.delete"
]
}
}
]
}
Write the updated deny policy
After you modify the deny policy locally, you must write
the updated deny policy to IAM.
Each deny policy contains an etag field that identifies the policy version.
The etag changes each time you update the policy. When you write the updated
policy, the etag in your request must match the current etag stored in
IAM; if the values do not match, the request fails. This feature
helps prevent concurrent changes from overwriting each other.
gcloud
To update the deny policy for a resource, run the
gcloud iam policies update command:
gcloud iam policies update POLICY_ID \
--attachment-point = ATTACHMENT_POINT \
--kind = denypolicies \
--policy-file = POLICY_FILE
Provide the following values:
POLICY_ID : The identifier for the deny policy.
ATTACHMENT_POINT : An identifier for the resource that
the deny policy is attached to. To learn how to format this value, see
Attachment point .
POLICY_FILE : The filepath for the JSON file that
contains the deny policy.
By default, if this command succeeds, it does not print any output. To print a
detailed response, add the flag --format=json to the command.
For example, the following command updates a deny policy named my-deny-policy
for the project my-project , using a file named policy.json :
gcloud iam policies update my-deny-policy \
--attachment-point = cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/my-project \
--kind = denypolicies \
--policy-file = policy.json

The
policies.update
method updates a deny policy.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
ENCODED_ATTACHMENT_POINT : A URL-encoded identifier for the resource that
the deny policy is attached to. To learn how to format this value, see
Attachment point .
POLICY_ID : An identifier for the deny policy.
POLICY : The updated deny policy.
For example, to add a permission to the policy shown in the previous step, replace
POLICY with the following:
{
"name" : "policies/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2F1234567890123/denypolicies/my-policy" ,

The response identifies a long-running operation. You can monitor the status of the long-running
operation to find out when it's complete. For details, see
Check the status of a long-running operation on this page.
Delete a deny policy
If you no longer want to enforce the rules in a deny policy, you can delete the
deny policy.
Caution: Deleting a deny policy is permanent. You cannot undelete deny policies.
Optionally, you can specify the etag for the policy version that you are
deleting. If you specify the etag , it must match the current etag stored by
IAM; if the values do not match, the request fails. You can use
this feature to ensure that you are deleting the intended policy, rather than an
updated version of that policy.
If you omit the etag from the request, IAM deletes the policy
unconditionally.
Note:
In general, policy changes take effect within 2 minutes. However, in some cases, it
can take 7 minutes or more for changes to propagate across the system.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Deny tab on the IAM page.
Go to IAM
Select a project, folder, or organization.
In the Policy ID column, click the ID of the policy that you want to
delete.
Click delete Delete . In the
confirmation dialog, click Confirm .
gcloud
To delete a deny policy from a resource, run the
gcloud iam policies delete command:
gcloud iam policies delete POLICY_ID \
--attachment-point = ATTACHMENT_POINT \
--kind = denypolicies
Provide the following values:
POLICY_ID : The identifier for the deny policy.
ATTACHMENT_POINT : An identifier for the resource that
the deny policy is attached to. To learn how to format this value, see
Attachment point .
Optionally, you can add the flag --etag= ETAG . Replace
ETAG with the current etag value for the deny policy.
By default, if this command succeeds, it does not print any output. To print a
detailed response, add the flag --format=json to the command.
For example, the following command deletes a deny policy named my-deny-policy
from the project my-project :
gcloud iam policies delete my-deny-policy \
--attachment-point = cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/my-project \
--kind = denypolicies

REST
The
policies.delete
method deletes a deny policy from a resource.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
ENCODED_ATTACHMENT_POINT : A URL-encoded identifier for the resource that
the deny policy is attached to. To learn how to format this value, see
Attachment point .
POLICY_ID : An identifier for the deny policy.
ETAG : Optional. An identifier for the version of the policy. If present,
this value must match the current etag value for the policy.
HTTP method and URL:
DELETE https://iam.googleapis.com/v2/policies/ ENCODED_ATTACHMENT_POINT /denypolicies/ POLICY_ID ?etag= ETAG

The response identifies a long-running operation. You can monitor the status of the long-running
operation to find out when it's complete. For details, see
Check the status of a long-running operation on this page.
Check the status of a long-running operation
When you use the REST API or the client libraries, any method that changes a
deny policy returns a long-running operation, or LRO. The long-running operation
tracks the status of the request and indicates whether the change to the policy
is complete.
Note: If you use the gcloud CLI, you can see the long-running
operation by running a command with the --format=json flag. However, you must
use the REST API or the client libraries to get the operation's status.

Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
ENCODED_ATTACHMENT_POINT : A URL-encoded identifier for the resource that
the deny policy is attached to. To learn how to format this value, see
Attachment point .
OPERATION_ID : The identifier for the operation. You receive this
identifier in the response to your original request, as part of the operation name. Use the
hexadecimal value at the end of the operation name. For example, 89cb3e508bf1ff01 .

}
If the operation's done field is not present, continue to monitor its status
by getting the operation repeatedly. Use
truncated exponential backoff to introduce a delay between
each request. When the done field is set to true , the operation is complete,
and you can stop getting the operation.
