Deny policy deny rules
All Google Cloud services (see
Support for inherited conditions )
Note:
Certain
areas of the Google Cloud console don't recognize allow policy role bindings
with tag-based conditions. As a result, if you have a role with a tag-based
condition, then the Google Cloud console might incorrectly prevent you from
performing certain actions. If you encounter this issue, then use an alternate
method, such as the gcloud CLI, to perform the action.

The following attributes relate to the details of the request.
Attribute
Usage summary
Supported Google Cloud services
Access levels attribute
Manage access based on specific access level(s).
An access level is a calculated attribute based on raw attributes
about the request and requester, such as the origin IP address, device
attributes, and time of day. For example, an onNetwork
access level might require that the device making the request
originates from a particular IP address range. Access levels are
defined by an organization's administrators.

Destination IP/port attributes
Manage access based on the destination IP address and/or port of a
request. For example, a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance
might expose an external IP, such as 10.0.0.2 , but port
22 might be exposed for administrative usage only.
Used for Identity-Aware Proxy TCP
forwarding.
You can use these attributes in allow policy role bindings.
Identity-Aware Proxy
Forwarding rule
attributes
Specify the types of
forwarding
rules that a principal can create. For example, you could allow a
principal to create forwarding rules for
internal
Google Cloud load balancers , which handle traffic that originates
inside a Google Cloud network, but not for external
Google Cloud load balancers, which handle traffic that
originates from the internet.
You can use these attributes in allow policy role bindings.

Cloud Service Mesh
URL path/host attributes
Manage access based on the URL path and/or host of a request. For
example, a condition could specify that
https://example.com is the main application accessible by
a general domain of users, while
https://hr.example.com/admin is used to access a page in
the application that only Human Resources admins can access.
You can use these attributes in allow policy role bindings.

Cloud Run
For more details about request attributes, see Request attributes on
this page.
Support for inherited conditions
In addition to adding conditions to the allow policies of some service-specific resources, it's
possible to add conditional role bindings to resources at the organization, folder, or project
level. When added at the container resource level, the conditional role bindings are inherited by
other resources through the resource hierarchy .
Inherited conditions are useful when a resource doesn't allow conditions in their allow policies or
doesn't have an allow policy.
When you use attributes at the organization, folder, or project level, keep in mind that most
attributes are available only for specific resource types. If part of a condition uses an attribute
that isn't available for a resource, then that part of the condition is never interpreted as
granting access. For example, the condition resource.name.endsWith == devResource never
grants access to any IAM resource because IAM resources don't provide
the resource name.
To prevent this issue, use the resource
type and resource
service attributes to limit the scope of the condition. For example, the
following condition evaluates to true for all resource types
other than Compute Engine instances; in contrast, for Compute Engine
instances, the condition checks resource name:
resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' ||
resource.name.endsWith('devResource')
Important: If your condition uses the resource.name attribute, we strongly
recommend that you use the resource.type attribute, not the resource.service
attribute, to explicitly limit which resource types the resource.name
condition applies to. For details, see
resource.name attribute on this page.
Resource attributes
The resource service, resource type, and resource name attributes are typically
used to change the scope of an access grant provided by the role binding. When a
role contains permissions that apply to different resource-specific attributes,
resource-based conditions can be used to grant a subset of the role's
permissions for specific type(s) or for specific service(s).
resource.service attribute
The resource.service attribute lets you set a condition based on the
Google Cloud service being used. For example, you could set a condition
limiting a user's access to resources that use the
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com service. For a list of supported values,
see Resource service values .
You can use the resource.service attribute in allow policy role bindings.
Attribute variable

Details
When you use the resource.type attribute in conditions,
check for exact equality ( == ) or exact
inequality ( != ) with the attribute.
Other comparisons, such as checking for a prefix or suffix, might give
you unexpected results.

1 Cloud Key Management Service uses this resource type as the parent of
key ring resources.
resource.name attribute
The resource.name attribute lets you set a condition based on all or part of a
resource name. For a list of resource name formats, see Resource name
format .
The resource.name attribute is available only for specific resource types,
which are listed in the table in this section. We strongly recommend that you
limit the applicability of the condition to the intended resource type. If a
role contains permissions for a resource type that does not provide the
resource.name attribute, you should ensure that those permissions are not
restricted by the part of the condition that checks resource.name .
The following example shows how to ensure this behavior. In this example, the
condition allows access to all resource types except Cloud Storage buckets and
objects. In contrast, for buckets and objects, the condition only allows access
to the bucket example-bucket and the objects it contains:
(resource.type != 'storage.googleapis.com/Bucket' &&
resource.type != 'storage.googleapis.com/Object') ||
resource.name.startsWith('projects/_/buckets/example-bucket')
Note that the first part of the condition checks whether the resource is neither
a bucket nor an object. If the resource has a different type, then the entire
condition evaluates to true , regardless of the resource name.
Also, note that the condition checks the resource.type attribute, not the
resource.service attribute. There are a few benefits of checking the
resource.type attribute:
It limits the resource.name check to the appropriate set of resources. For
example, if you want to grant access to Compute Engine instances with a
specific name, it makes sense to exclude all resource types other than
Compute Engine instances.
It prevents the scope of the condition from changing if a service adds new
resource types in the future.
Finally, note that the condition uses the startsWith() function to evaluate
the resource name, rather than checking for equality with the ==
operator. Because the condition looks at the start of the resource name, it
matches a bucket as well as the objects in that bucket. If it checked for
equality, it would only match the bucket.
You cannot use wildcard characters such as * to match multiple resource
names. Consider these alternatives:
Use the extract() function to extract a value from a resource name. For
example, you can extract a project ID from the resource name of a
Compute Engine VM instance, then write a condition expression that
refers to the project ID.
For details, see Extracting values from attributes on this page.
Use the startsWith() or endsWith() function to write a condition that
evaluates the start or end of the resource name.
You can use the resource.name attribute in allow policy role bindings.
Attribute variable
resource.name
Attribute type
string
Each resource type uses a specific format for the resource name. For a
list of formats, see
Resource
name format .
Supported functions and operators
startsWith(), endsWith(), extract(), == , !=
Details
The resource.name contains the
relative
resource name for the target resource in the request. The
relative resource name is a URI path without a leading forward slash
( / ).
The startsWith() function takes the prefix string literal
to be evaluated against resource.name .
The endsWith() function takes the suffix string literal
to be evaluated against resource.name .
The extract() function uses an extraction template to
extract part of resource.name . For details, see
Extracting values from resource names on this
page.
The == and != operators are for comparison
with the entire resource.name , or an extracted portion of
the resource.name .
Examples
Returns true unless the resource name identifies a
Cloud Storage bucket named secret-bucket-123 :
resource.name != "projects/_/buckets/secret-bucket-123"
Returns true if the resource name starts with the
specified prefix, in the format used by Compute Engine VM
instances:
resource.name.startsWith("projects/project-123/zones/us-east1-b/instances/prod-")
Returns true if the resource name starts with the
specified prefix, in the format used by Cloud Storage buckets:
resource.name.startsWith("projects/_/buckets/my_bucket/objects/test-object-")
Returns true if the resource name ends with the
specified suffix—for example, the file extension of a
Cloud Storage object:
resource.name.endsWith(".jpg")
Returns the project name or number if it's present:
resource.name.extract("projects/{project}/")

Resource tags
The resource tag functions let you set a condition based on the tags that are
attached to supported resources or inherited by those
resources' descendants. For example, you can set a condition that grants a
role only for resources that have the tag env: prod attached. To learn more
about controlling access with tags, see
Tags and access control .
Each tag consists of a key and a value. There are a few different types of
identifiers for each key and value:
A permanent ID , which is globally unique and can never be reused. For example, a tag
key could have the permanent ID tagKeys/123456789012 , and a tag value could have
the permanent ID tagValues/567890123456 .
A short name . The short name for each key must be unique within the project or
organization under which the key is defined, and the short name for each value must be unique
for its associated key. For example, a tag key could have the short name env , and
a tag value could have the short name prod .
A namespaced name , which adds your organization's numeric ID or project's ID to the
short name of a tag key. For example, a tag key created for an organization could have the
namespaced name 123456789012/env . To learn how to get your organization ID, see
Getting
your organization resource ID . A tag key created for a project could have the namespaced
name myproject/env . To learn how to get your project ID, see
Identifying
projects .
For guidance on choosing which type of identifier to use in your conditions, see
Tag definitions and identifiers .
You can use tag-based conditions to conditionalize access to any resource. This
includes resources with their own tags, as well as resources that inherit tags
from other resources. To learn more about how tags are inherited through
the resource hierarchy, see Tag inheritance .
However, certain
areas of the Google Cloud console don't recognize allow policy role bindings
with tag-based conditions. As a result, if you have a role with a tag-based
condition, then the Google Cloud console might incorrectly prevent you from
performing certain actions. If you encounter this issue, then use an alternate
method, such as the gcloud CLI, to perform the action.
You can use tag-based conditions in the following:
Allow policy role bindings
Deny policy deny rules
You can use the following functions to set conditions based on tags:
Function
Description

resource.hasTagKeyId('tagKeys/123456789012')
resource.matchTag( keyName: string, valueShortName: string )
trending_flat bool
Checks whether the resource for the request has a tag with the
specified key and value. The key is looked up by its namespaced
name , and the value is looked up by its short name . To
check for a tag key and value using their permanent IDs , use
the function resource.matchTagId() .
Parameters
keyName : The namespaced name for the tag key, with
the organization's numeric ID and a forward slash as a prefix.
For example, 123456789012/env .
valueShortName : The short name for the tag value.
For example, prod .
Example
Returns true if the resource for the request has a tag
with the key 123456789012/env and the value
prod :
resource.matchTag('123456789012/env', 'prod')
resource.matchTagId( keyId: string, valueId: string )
trending_flat bool
Checks whether the resource for the request has a tag with the
specified key and value. The key and value are looked up by their
permanent IDs . To check for a tag key using its
namespaced name and a value using its short name ,
use the function resource.matchTag() .
Parameters
keyId : The permanent ID for the tag key. For
example, tagKeys/123456789012 .
valueId : The permanent ID for the tag value. For
example, tagValues/567890123456 .
Example
Returns true if the resource for the request has a
tag with the key tagKeys/123456789012 and the value
tagValues/567890123456 :
resource.matchTagId('tagKeys/123456789012', 'tagValues/567890123456')
Principal attributes
The principal attributes let you write conditions based on the principal that
issued the request. With these attributes, you can refine the principals that a
policy is enforced for.
You can use principal attributes in policy bindings for principal access boundary
policies.
principal.type attribute
The principal.type attribute lets you set a condition based on the type of
principal issuing the request. For example, you could add a condition to a
policy binding for a principal access boundary policy to ensure that the policy is only
enforced for service accounts.
You can use principal attributes in policy bindings for principal access boundary
policies.

Evaluates to true if the principal in the request is
an Agent Identity:
principal.type == "iam.googleapis.com/AgentPoolIdentity"
Evaluates to true if the principal in the request is
a Google Workspace identity or workforce identity pool
identity:
principal.type in ["iam.googleapis.com/WorkspaceIdentity", "iam.googleapis.com/WorkforcePoolIdentity"]
principal.subject attribute
The principal.subject attribute lets you set a condition based on the
principal issuing the request. For example, you could add a condition to a
policy binding for a principal access boundary policy to ensure that the policy is only
enforced for principals whose email addresses end with @example.com .
If you use the principal.subject attribute in a condition, we recommend also
using the principal.type attribute to control which types
of principals the condition applies to. This is because principal identifiers
aren't necessarily unique across principal types. For example, the identifier
example-user@example.com could identify a Google Account or a user in a
workforce identity pool.
By using the principal.type attribute in addition to the principal.subject
attribute, you can ensure that the condition only matches principals with the
intended type. For example, the following expression matches Google Accounts
whose email addresses end with @example.com :
principal.type == 'iam.googleapis.com/WorkspaceIdentity' &&
principal.subject.endsWith('@example.com')
Note: Conditions with this attribute evaluate against a principal's primary
email address only—they don't evaluate against a principal's aliases.
You can use principal attributes in policy bindings for principal access boundary
policies.
Attribute variable
principal.subject
Attribute type
string
Supported operators
== , != , in, startsWith(), endsWith()
Caution: The startsWith() and endsWith()
functions match all principals that start with or end with
the specified value. For example, the expression
startsWith('security-admin') matches
security-admin@example.com and
security-admin@example-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com ,
but also matches security-admin-fake@example.com .
Supported principal subjects
Google Accounts
Identifier: user's email address
Example: alex@example.com
Workforce identity pool identities
Identifier: identity's subject attribute value
Example: raha@altostrat.com
Workload identity pool identities
Identifier: identity's subject attribute value
Service accounts
Identifier: service account's email address
Example: my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Agent identity (Preview)
Identifier: the Agent Identity, starting with
resources/
Example:
resources/aiplatform/projects/9876543210/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/my-test-agent
Example
Evaluates to true if the principal in the request ends with @example.com :
principal.subject.endsWith("@example.com")
Evaluates to true if the principal in the request starts
with resources/aiplatform , which is true for agent
identities that use the Vertex AI platform:
principal.subject.startsWith("resources/aiplatform/")
Evaluates to true if the principal in the request is
example-service-account@example-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com :
principal.subject == "example-service-account@example-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
Request attributes
Request attributes enable you to create conditions that evaluate details about
the request, such as its access level, its date and time, the destination IP
address and port (for IAP TCP tunneling), or the expected URL
path/host (for IAP and Cloud Run).
Access levels attribute
The access levels attribute enables users to set a condition requiring that a
request meets one or more access levels in order to be authorized. You can use
the access levels attribute in allow policy role bindings.
The access levels attribute is derived from attributes of the request, such as
the origin IP address, device attributes, and the time of day. For example, an
access level named fullyTrusted might require that the device making the
request is owned by the company and has a screen lock. An onNetwork access
level might require that the device making the request originates from a
particular IP address range. See the
Access Context Manager
documentation for more information about access levels.
The access levels attribute is available only when you use Identity-Aware Proxy to
access a tunnel instance, or to access a web application running on App Engine
or Compute Engine backend services. More specifically, the access levels
attribute is available only for requests that check one of these permissions:
iap.tunnelInstances.accessViaIAP
iap.webServiceVersions.accessViaIAP
Warning: If you use the access levels attribute in a role binding, then the
binding must grant a role that contains only the
iap.tunnelInstances.accessViaIAP and iap.webServiceVersions.accessViaIAP
permissions. If the binding grants a role that contains other permissions, then
these additional, unsupported permissions won't work correctly.
You can use the access levels attribute when you conditionally grant the
following predefined roles:
IAP-secured Tunnel User ( roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor )
Contains a single permission, iap.tunnelInstances.accessViaIAP .
IAP-secured Web App User ( roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor )
Contains a single permission, iap.webServiceVersions.accessViaIAP .
You can also use the access levels attribute to conditionally grant a custom
role that contains these permissions. The custom role must not contain any other
permissions.
request.auth.access_levels attribute
Attribute variable
request.auth.access_levels
Attribute type
list < string >
Supported operators
in
Details
To check whether a request meets a specific access level, use the
in operator:
ACCESS_LEVEL_FULL_NAME in request.auth.access_levels
The full name of an access level uses the following format:
accessPolicies/ POLICY_NUMBER /accessLevels/ ACCESS_LEVEL
Note: The access level is case sensitive, and it must match
exactly what is configured in Access Context Manager. For example, if the
condition uses accesslevels , in all lowercase, rather
than accessLevels , with Levels capitalized,
then the access level in the request will never match the access level
in the condition.
Example
Returns true if the request meets the
CorpNet access level:
"accessPolicies/199923665455/accessLevels/CorpNet"
in request.auth.access_levels
Supported resource types
Available for requests that use Identity-Aware Proxy to access a tunnel instance, tunnel destination group, web application running on Google Cloud load balancing, or web application running on App Engine.
API attributes
API attributes help you manage access based on data provided by a specific
Google Cloud API or service. You can use API attributes in allow policy
role bindings.
For example, when you use Cloud Storage to
list the objects in a bucket , you can use the prefix parameter
in the request to include only objects whose names begin with a specific prefix.
If you use Credential Access Boundaries to downscope short-lived
credentials, you can create a Credential Access Boundary that limits permissions
to list objects by checking the API attribute
storage.googleapis.com/objectListPrefix . This API attribute contains the value
of the prefix parameter from the request.
For examples of when you might need to use API attributes in a condition, see
the following pages:
Limit permissions when listing objects
Setting limits on granting roles
Not all services recognize API attributes. The following sections indicate which
services recognize each API attribute.
Functions for API attributes
You can use the following function to work with API attributes:
Function
Description
api.getAttribute( attributeName: string, defaultValue: V<T> )
trending_flat V<T>
Gets the requested API attribute.
Parameters
attributeName : The API attribute to get. For
supported values, see
Cloud Storage API
attributes and
IAM API
attributes on this page.
defaultValue : The default value ( V )
to use if the API attribute is not available. The value
V is of type T , where T
is the same type as the API attribute's value. For example, if
the API attribute's value is a string, you can use an empty
string, or a placeholder string such as
undefined .
Note: For the API attribute
iam.googleapis.com/modifiedGrantsByRole , the
default value must be an empty list ( [] ).
Example
Returns one of the following:
For requests to grant or revoke a role, returns a list of
roles that were modified by the request.
For all other types of requests, returns an empty list.
api.getAttribute("iam.googleapis.com/modifiedGrantsByRole", [])
hasOnly( items: list<T> )
trending_flat bool
Checks that a list contains only the allowed items, or a subset of
those items. You can call the function on a list returned by
api.getAttribute() .
Parameter
items : A list of items with type T . Each
item is a value that the API attribute is allowed to contain.
Example
Checks whether the request would grant or revoke any roles other
than Pub/Sub Editor ( roles/pubsub.editor ) or Pub/Sub
Publisher ( roles/pubsub.publisher ):
api.getAttribute('iam.googleapis.com/modifiedGrantsByRole', [])
.hasOnly(['roles/pubsub.editor', 'roles/pubsub.publisher'])
The following shows the result for different request values:
Granted/revoked roles
Result
None
true
If no roles are modified, then
api.getAttribute() returns the default value.
For this attribute, the default value is always an empty
list. By definition, an empty list does not contain values
that are not on the allowlist.
roles/pubsub.editor
true
The role is on the allowlist.
roles/pubsub.editor
roles/pubsub.publisher
true
Both roles are on the allowlist.
roles/billing.admin
false
The role is not on the allowlist.
roles/billing.admin
roles/pubsub.editor
false
One role is on the allowlist, but the other is not.
Cloud Storage API attributes
Cloud Storage provides the following API attribute.
Warning:
API attributes for Cloud Storage are supported only in
Credential Access Boundaries . If you use
Cloud Storage API attributes in a conditional role binding, then Cloud Storage methods
will work incorrectly and fail unexpectedly. In addition, it might take longer to check
IAM permissions when you access Cloud Storage.
Attribute variable
storage.googleapis.com/objectListPrefix
Attribute type
string
Details
For a request to list
objects in a bucket , contains the value of the prefix
parameter from the request. If the request omits the
prefix parameter, the attribute is not defined.
For other types of requests, the attribute is not defined.
Services that recognize this attribute
Cloud Storage
IAM API attributes
IAM provides the following API attribute:
Attribute variable
iam.googleapis.com/modifiedGrantsByRole
Attribute type
list<string>
Details
For a request to
set
the allow policy of a resource, this attribute contains the role
names from the role bindings that the request modifies.
For other types of requests, the attribute is not defined.
Resource types that accept this attribute
The following resource types accept conditions with the
modifiedGrantsByRole attribute in their allow policies:
Projects
Folders
Organizations
Services that recognize this attribute
The following services recognize the
modifiedGrantsByRole attribute:
Caution: If a service does not recognize the
modifiedGrantsByRole attribute, you cannot
limit an
IAM admin's ability to grant roles for that
service. If a limited IAM admin tries to grant a role
on a resource, and the resource's service does not recognize the
modifiedGrantsByRole attribute, then the request fails.
The exception to this behavior is
BigQuery
datasets . Datasets don't recognize the
modifiedGrantsByRole attribute, but limited
IAM admins can still grant or revoke roles on
datasets. Specifically, if a limited IAM admin's role
includes permissions to grant roles on datasets, they can do
so , regardless of any limits placed on their role granting.

Date/time attribute
The date/time attribute is used to set expirable, scheduled, or limited-duration
access to Google Cloud resources. You can use date/time attributes in
allow policy role bindings.
This attribute is supported for all Google Cloud services and resource
types. To learn how to apply date/time conditions to resources that don't
directly support them, see
Support for inherited conditions on this page.
The request.time attribute contains the timestamp for the request. You can
compare this timestamp to another timestamp, or to a duration of time.
The following sections list the functions that you can use to set conditions
based on timestamps and durations.
Create, compare, and modify timestamps and durations
Function or operator
Description
date( value: string )
trending_flat Timestamp
Converts a date from a string to a Timestamp .
Parameter
value : A date in the format YYYY-MM-DD ,
where YYYY is the year, MM is the
two-digit month, and DD is the two-digit day. The
resulting Timestamp contains the specified date and the
time 00:00:00.000 UTC .
Example
Creates a Timestamp that represents the date
2023-02-01 and the time
00:00:00.000 UTC :
date("2023-02-01")
duration( value: string )
trending_flat Duration
Converts an amount of time from a string to a
Duration .
Parameter
value : A Duration in seconds, followed by
s .
Examples
Creates a duration that represents 1.5 minutes:
duration("90s")
Creates a duration that represents 30 days:
duration("2592000s")
timestamp( value: string )
trending_flat Timestamp
Converts a string to a Timestamp .
Parameter
value : A UTC timestamp that complies with
RFC
3339 .
Important: If the input parameter is invalid, then the
condition will never allow access to any resource.
Example
Creates a timestamp that represents April 12, 2023, at 23:20:50.52
in UTC:
timestamp("2023-04-12T23:20:50.52Z")
< , <= , > , >=
Compares two Timestamp values.
Note: Avoid using the equality
( == ) and inequality
( != ) operators to compare
timestamps. Timestamps have millisecond precision, so it's typically
not useful to check for exact matches or mismatches.
Examples
Returns true if the request time is before
April 12, 2022, at 00:00:00 UTC:
request.time < timestamp("2022-04-12T00:00:00.00Z")
Returns true if the request time is before or
equal to April 12, 2022, at 00:00:00 UTC:
request.time <= timestamp("2022-04-12T00:00:00.00Z")
Returns true if the request time is after
April 12, 2022, at 00:00:00 UTC:
request.time > timestamp("2022-04-12T00:00:00.00Z")
Returns true if the request time is after or
equal to April 12, 2022, at 00:00:00 UTC:
request.time >= timestamp("2022-04-12T00:00:00.00Z")
timestamp + duration
trending_flat Timestamp
timestamp - duration
trending_flat Timestamp
Add or subtract a Duration from a Timestamp .
Examples
Returns the Timestamp that falls 30 minutes after
14:30:00 UTC on 2024-04-12:
timestamp("2024-04-12T14:30:00.00Z") + duration("1800s")
Returns the Timestamp that falls 60 days before
14:30:00 UTC on 2024-04-12:
timestamp("2024-04-12T14:30:00.00Z") - duration("5184000s")
Extract information from a timestamp
The functions in this section let you extract information from a timestamp, such
as the day of the week that the timestamp falls on.
In IAM Conditions, all timestamps are in UTC. However, you might
want to extract information based on a different time zone. For example, you
might want to know whether a UTC timestamp falls on a Monday in the time zone
for Berlin, Germany.
To specify a different time zone, pass the time zone into the function. Use a
name or UTC offset from the
IETF
Time Zone Database . For example, you could use Europe/Berlin or +01:00
for Central European Time (CET).

< , <= , > , >=, == , !=
Compares the output of two functions in this table.
Destination IP/port attributes
The destination IP/port attribute enables users to manage access based on the
internal destination IP address and port for a request. You can use
destination IP/port attributes in allow policy role bindings.
For example, a Compute Engine VM instance might map the external IP
address and port 132.168.42.21:3001 to the internal IP address and port
10.0.0.1:2300 for general usage. In contrast, the internal IP address and port
10.0.0.1:22 might only be available internally for administrative usage. You
can use the destination IP/port attributes to grant different amounts of access
based on the internal IP address and port.
For more information about TCP forwarding, see the
Identity-Aware Proxy documentation .
destination.ip attribute
Attribute variable
destination.ip
Attribute type
string
Supported operators
== , !=
Details
The variable destination.ip identifies an internal IP
address in IPv4 format.
Note: We don't recommend using the startsWith()
and endsWith() functions with the
destination.ip attribute. These functions might give you
unexpected results. In particular, we don't recommend matching a
prefix in destination.ip to check a CIDR address range.
Examples
Returns true if the destination IP address is
10.0.0.1 :
destination.ip == "10.0.0.1"
Returns true unless the destination IP address is
10.0.0.1 :
destination.ip != "10.0.0.1"
Supported resource types
Available for requests that use Identity-Aware Proxy to access a tunnel instance
destination.port attribute
Attribute variable
destination.port
Attribute type
int
Supported operators
== , != , < , <= , > , >=
Details
The variable destination.port identifies an internal TCP
port number.
Examples
Returns true if the destination port is 21 :
destination.port == 21
Returns true if the destination port is less than
3001 :
destination.port < 3001
Supported resource types
Available for requests that use Identity-Aware Proxy to access a tunnel instance
Forwarding rule attributes
The forwarding rule attributes enable you to specify the types of forwarding
rules that a principal can create. For example, you
could allow a principal to create forwarding rules for internal Google Cloud
load balancers , which handle traffic that originates
inside a Google Cloud network, but not for external Google Cloud
load balancers, which handle traffic that originates from the internet. You can
use forwarding rule attributes in allow policy role bindings.
For Cloud Load Balancing, the forwarding rule attributes don't affect the
ability to create other components of a Google Cloud load balancer, such
as backend services, target proxies, health checks, and URL maps.
Note: In the Google Cloud console, if you want to include the forwarding rule
attributes in a condition expression, you must use the Condition editor. The
forwarding rule attributes are not available in the Condition builder.
Supported functions
Function
Description
compute.isForwardingRule CreationOperation()
trending_flat bool
Checks whether the request is creating a
forwarding
rule .
Example
See the example for
compute.matchLoadBalancingSchemes() .
compute.matchLoad BalancingSchemes( schemes: list<string> )
trending_flat bool
Checks whether the request affects one of the specified types of load
balancing scheme. To find the identifier for each load balancing
scheme, as well as more details, see
Using
IAM Conditions on Google Cloud load
balancers .
Note: In general, if you use this function in a condition
expression, you should also use
compute.isForwardingRuleCreationOperation() . See the
examples in this cell for details.
Parameter
schemes : The load balancing schemes that the request
is allowed to affect.
Example
Returns one of the following:
If the request is not creating a forwarding rule,
returns true .
If the request is creating a forwarding rule, returns
true only if the forwarding rule affects an
INTERNAL , INTERNAL_MANAGED , or
INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing scheme.
!compute.isForwardingRuleCreationOperation() || (
compute.isForwardingRuleCreationOperation() &&
compute.matchLoadBalancingSchemes([
'INTERNAL', 'INTERNAL_MANAGED', 'INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED'
])
)
Supported resource types
This attribute is available for requests to create the following resource types:

URL path/host attribute
The URL path/host attribute enables users to manage access based on the URL path
and host of a request. For example, a condition could specify that
https://example.com is the main application accessible by a general domain of
users, while https://hr.example.com/admin is used to access a page in the
application where only Human Resources admins can access this portion.
You can use the URL path/host attribute in allow policy role bindings.
request.path attribute
Attribute variable
request.path
Attribute type
string
Supported functions and operators
== , startsWith(), endsWith()
Details
We don't recommend using the != operator with this
attribute. Instead of checking for inequality, as in
request.path != "/admin" , check the attribute's prefix, as
in !request.path.startsWith("/admin") . By checking the
prefix, you also protect URL paths within the /admin
hierarchy, such as /admin/payroll/ .
Examples
Returns true if the request path is equal to the
specified URL path:
request.path == "/admin"
request.path == "/admin/payroll"
Returns true if the request path starts with the
specified URL path:
request.path.startsWith("/admin")
Returns true if the request path ends with the specified
URL path:
request.path.endsWith("/payroll.js")
Supported resource types
Identity-Aware Proxy app service versions (App Engine):
Available for requests that use Identity-Aware Proxy to access a web
application running on App Engine or Compute Engine
Cloud Run services
request.host attribute
Attribute variable
request.host
Attribute type
string
Supported functions and operators
== , endsWith()
Details
We don't recommend using the .startsWith() function or the
!= operator with this attribute. These functions and
operators might give you unexpected results.
Examples
Returns true if the hostname is equal to the specified
value:
request.host == "www.example.com"
request.host == "hr.example.com"
Returns true if the hostname ends with the specified
value:
request.host.endsWith("example.com")
Supported resource types
Identity-Aware Proxy app service versions (App Engine):
Available for requests that use Identity-Aware Proxy to access an app service
version.
Cloud Run services
Extract values from attributes
You can use the extract() function to extract a value from an attribute. For
example, you can extract an arbitrary part of a resource name, then write a
condition expression that refers to the text you extracted.
To use the extract() function, you provide an extraction template , which
specifies the part of the attribute to extract. For example, if you want to
extract a project ID from the resource name of a Compute Engine VM
instance, you might use the template projects/{project}/ .
An extraction template contains the following parts:
An identifier , enclosed in curly braces, that identifies the substring to
extract.
Choose a short, meaningful identifier that makes it clear what value you
want to extract. You can use uppercase and lowercase letters from A to
Z ; numeric digits; and underscores ( _ ).
In the template projects/{project}/ , the identifier is project .
Optional: A prefix , which must appear before the substring to extract.
In the template projects/{project}/ , the prefix is projects/ .
Optional: A suffix , which must appear after the substring to extract.
In the template projects/{project}/ , the suffix is / .
The extract() function extracts different parts of the attribute based on
whether the extraction template has a prefix, a suffix, or both:
Has prefix
Has suffix
Extracted value
