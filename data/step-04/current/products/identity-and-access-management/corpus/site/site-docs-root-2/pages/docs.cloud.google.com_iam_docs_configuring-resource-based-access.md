Configure resource-based access
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
This page describes how to manage access to specific resources using conditional
role bindings in your allow policies. By using resource
attributes in a condition
expression, you can control whether a principal can use a permission to access a
resource based on the resource's name, type, and Google Cloud service.
Note: The examples on this page show how to modify access to a
project .
However, you can adapt these steps to modify access to any Google Cloud resource that
accepts IAM allow policies. For a list of these resource types, see
Resource types that accept allow policies .
Before you begin
Read the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Conditions overview to understand the basics of
IAM conditional role bindings.
Review the resource attributes that
can be used in a condition expression.
The resource name attribute can control access to the
following Google Cloud services:
Apigee
Application Integration
Apigee API Hub
Backup and DR Service
BigQuery
BigQuery Reservation API
Bigtable
Binary Authorization
Cloud Deploy
Customer Experience Agent Studio
Cloud Key Management Service
Cloud Logging
Cloud SQL
Cloud Storage
Compute Engine
Dataform
Google Kubernetes Engine
Firestore
Cloud NGFW
Integration Connectors
Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka
Network Security Integration
Parameter Manager
Pub/Sub Lite
Secret Manager
Spanner
Important: Review
Important usage considerations for resource-based conditions
at the bottom of this page before applying a condition of this type in a
production environment.
Required roles
To get the permissions that
you need to manage conditional role bindings,
ask your administrator to grant you the
following IAM roles:
To manage access to projects:
Project IAM Admin ( roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin )
on the project
To manage access to folders:
Folder Admin ( roles/resourcemanager.folderAdmin )
on the folder
To manage access to projects, folders, and organizations:
Organization Admin ( roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin )
on the organization
To manage access to almost all Google Cloud resources:
Security Admin ( roles/iam.securityAdmin )
on the project, folder, or organization whose resources you want to manage access to
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
These predefined roles contain
the permissions required to manage conditional role bindings. To see the exact permissions that are
required, expand the Required permissions section:
Required permissions
The following permissions are required to manage conditional role bindings:
To manage access to projects:
resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy
on the project
resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy
on the project
To manage access to folders:
resourcemanager.folders.getIamPolicy
on the folder
resourcemanager.folders.setIamPolicy
on the folder
To manage access to organizations:
resourcemanager.organizations.getIamPolicy
on the organization
resourcemanager.organizations.setIamPolicy
on the organization
You might also be able to get
these permissions
with custom roles or
other predefined roles .
Grant access to a group of resources based on resource name prefixes
A conditional role binding can be used to grant access to principals for
resources whose resource names match a prefix, such as Compute Engine virtual
machine (VM) instances whose names start with a certain string. The resource
name prefix is typically used to group resources intended for certain purpose or
that have certain properties.
Note: Conditional role bindings do not override role bindings with no conditions. If a
principal is bound to a role, and the role binding does not have a condition, then the principal
always has that role. Adding the principal to a conditional binding for the same role has no
effect.
For example, imagine that you run workloads on certain VM instances that
may operate on sensitive healthcare data. Other non-sensitive workloads must run
in the same project, and you want to ensure that your developers have limited
access to VM instances that operate on sensitive data. To accomplish this goal,
you name data-sensitive VM instances with a sensitiveAccess prefix, and other
VM instances with a devAccess prefix. Then, you use conditional role bindings
to ensure that the developers can remain productive with normal devAccess VM
instances, but without granting them access to sensitiveAccess VM instances.
While you can use the resource.name condition attribute alone to manage
access, it's common to use the resource.type and resource.service attributes
as well. When you use these additional attributes, you make it less likely that
a condition will affect access to different resource types with similar names.
In addition, you can limit the scope of the condition so that principals can
still use permissions in the role to access other resource types or services.
The example in this section controls access using both the resource.name and
resource.type attributes. For more information about scoping conditions at the
container resource level, see the Inherited conditions
section of this document.
Note: You cannot use conditions when you grant
legacy basic roles , including Owner
( roles/owner ), Editor ( roles/editor ), and Viewer
( roles/viewer ). Also, you cannot use conditions when you grant roles to all users
( allUsers ) or all authenticated users
( allAuthenticatedUsers ).
To grant access based on a name prefix to Compute Engine disks and
instances in a project:
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page.
Go to the
IAM page
From the list of principals, locate the desired principal and click the
edit button.
From the Edit permissions panel, locate the desired role to configure a
condition for. Then under IAM condition (optional) , click Add IAM
condition .
In the Edit condition panel, enter a title and optional
description for the condition.
You can add a condition expression using either the Condition builder or
the Condition editor . The condition builder provides an interactive
interface to select your desired condition type, operator, and other
applicable details about the expression. The condition editor provides a
text-based interface to manually enter an expression using CEL syntax.
Condition builder :
Delete any existing condition fields from the condition builder. The
only field in the condition builder should be the Add button.
Create a grouped condition expression that evaluates to true if the
resource is a disk that starts with the specified prefix:
Click the Add drop-down and then click Grouped conditions .
From the Condition type drop-down, select
Resource > Type .
From the Operator drop-down, select is .
From the Resource Type drop-down, select
compute.googleapis.com/Disk .
Click the first Add button immediately beneath the condition you just
entered to add another clause to the expression.
From the Condition type drop-down, select
Resource > Name .
From the Operator drop-down, select Starts with .
In the Value field, enter the resource
name ,
including the desired prefix, in the appropriate format. For example,
use projects/ PROJECT_ID /region/ ZONE_ID /disks/ PREFIX
to identify disks in the project PROJECT_ID and the
zone ZONE_ID whose names start with
PREFIX .
To the left of each condition type, click And to ensure both clauses
must be true.
Create a grouped condition expression that evaluates to true if the
resource is an instance that starts with the specified prefix:
Click the Add button outside of the existing condition group and
then click Grouped conditions .
From the Condition type drop-down, select
Resource > Type .
From the Operator drop-down, select is .
From the Resource Type drop-down, select
compute.googleapis.com/Instance .
In the same condition group, click Add .
From the Condition type drop-down, select
Resource > Name .
From the Operator drop-down, select Starts with .
In the Value field, enter the resource
name ,
with the desired prefix, in the appropriate format. For example, use
projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /instances/ PREFIX
to identify instances in the project PROJECT_ID
and the zone ZONE_ID whose names start with
PREFIX .
Ensure that the logic operator connecting the conditions in the group
is set to And .
Create a grouped condition expression that evaluates to true if the
resource isn't a disk or an instance:
Click the Add button outside of the existing condition groups and
then click Grouped conditions .
From the Condition type drop-down, select Resource > Type .
From the Operator drop-down, select is not .
From the Resource Type drop-down, select
compute.googleapis.com/Disk .
In the same condition group, click Add .
From the Condition type drop-down, select
Resource > Type .
From the Operator drop-down, select is not .
From the Resource Type drop-down, select
compute.googleapis.com/Instance .
Ensure that the logic operator connecting the conditions in the group
is set to And .
Ensure that the logic operator connecting all of the groups of condition
expressions is Or .
When you're finished, the condition builder should look similar to the
following:
Click Save to apply the condition.
After the Edit condition panel is closed, click Save again from
the Edit permissions panel to update your allow policy.
Condition editor :
Click the Condition editor tab and enter the following expression:
(resource.type == "compute.googleapis.com/Disk" &&
resource.name.startsWith("projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /disks/ PREFIX ")) ||
(resource.type == "compute.googleapis.com/Instance" &&
resource.name.startsWith("projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /instances/ PREFIX ")) ||
(resource.type != "compute.googleapis.com/Disk" &&
resource.type != "compute.googleapis.com/Instance")
After entering your expression, you can optionally choose to
lint the CEL syntax by clicking
Run Linter above the text box on the top-right.
Click Save to apply the condition.
Once the Edit condition panel is closed, click Save again from
the Edit permissions panel to update your allow policy.
gcloud
Allow policies are set using the
read-modify-write
pattern.
Execute the gcloud projects get-iam-policy
command to get the current allow policy for the project. In the following
example, the JSON version of the allow policy is downloaded to a path on disk.
Command:
gcloud projects get-iam-policy project-id --format=json > filepath
The JSON format of the allow policy is downloaded:
{
"bindings" : [
{
"members" : [
"user:my-user@example.com"
],
"role" : "roles/owner"
},
{
"members" : [
"group:my-group@example.com"
],
"role" : "roles/compute.instanceAdmin"
}
],
"etag" : "BwWKmjvelug=" ,
"version" : 1
}
To configure the allow policy with a resource name prefix condition, add the
following highlighted condition expression. The gcloud CLI updates
the version automatically:
{
"bindings" : [
{
"members" : [
"user:my-user@example.com"
],
"role" : "roles/owner"
},
{
"members" : [
"group:my-group@example.com"
],
"role" : "roles/compute.instanceAdmin" ,
"condition" : {
"title" : " PREFIX _only" ,
"description" : "Only gives access to VMs with the PREFIX prefix" ,
"expression" :
"(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /disks/ PREFIX ')) ||
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /instances/ PREFIX ')) ||
(resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' &&
resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk')"
}
}
],
"etag" : "BwWKmjvelug=" ,
"version" : 3
}
Next, set the new allow policy by executing the
gcloud projects set-iam-policy
command:
gcloud projects set-iam-policy project-id filepath
The new conditional role binding grants the group permissions in the
following way:
Members in the role binding can only use disk and instance permissions to
access disks and instances whose names start with the specified prefix
Members in the role binding can use all other permissions in the Instance
Admin role ( roles/compute.instanceAdmin ) to access all resources besides
disks and instances
REST
Use the
read-modify-write
pattern to allow access to specific resources.
First, read the allow policy for the project:
The Resource Manager API's
projects.getIamPolicy
method gets a project's allow policy.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project
ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like my-project .
POLICY_VERSION : The policy version to be
returned. Requests should specify the most recent policy version, which is policy version
3. See Specifying
a policy version when getting a policy for details.
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID :getIamPolicy
Request JSON body:
{
"options": {
"requestedPolicyVersion": POLICY_VERSION
}
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
, or by using Cloud Shell ,
which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -d @request.json \ "https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID :getIamPolicy"
PowerShell (Windows)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or
gcloud auth login
.
You can check the currently active account by running
gcloud auth list .
Save the request body in a file named request.json ,
and execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest ` -Method POST ` -Headers $headers ` -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" ` -InFile request.json ` -Uri "https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID :getIamPolicy" | Select-Object -Expand Content
APIs Explorer (browser)
Copy the request body and open the
method reference page .
The APIs Explorer panel opens on the right side of the page.
You can interact with this tool to send requests.
Paste the request body in this tool, complete any other required fields, and click Execute .
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"version": 1,
"etag": "BwWKmjvelug=",
"bindings": [
{
"role": "roles/owner",
"members": [
"user:my-user@example.com
]
},
{
"members": [
"group:my-group@example.com"
],
"role": "roles/compute.instanceAdmin"
}
]
}
Next, modify the allow policy so that it allows access to specific
resources. Make sure to change the version field to the value
3 :
{
"version" : 3 ,
"etag" : "BwWKmjvelug=" ,
"bindings" : [
{
"role" : "roles/owner" ,
"members" : [
"user:my-user@example.com"
]
},
{
"role" : "roles/compute.instanceAdmin" ,
"members" : [
"group:my-group@example.com"
],
"condition" : {
"title" : " PREFIX _only" ,
"description" : "Only gives access to VMs with the PREFIX prefix" ,
"expression" :
"(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /disks/ PREFIX ')) ||
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /instances/ PREFIX ')) ||
(resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' &&
resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk')"
}
}
]
}
Finally, write the updated allow policy:
The Resource Manager API's
projects.setIamPolicy
method sets the allow policy in the request as the project's new allow policy.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID : Your Google Cloud project
ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like my-project .
HTTP method and URL:
POST https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT_ID :setIamPolicy
Request JSON body:
{
"policy": {
"version": 3,
"etag": "BwWKmjvelug=",
"bindings": [
{
"role": "roles/owner",
"members": [
"user:my-user@example.com"
]
},
{
"role": "roles/compute.instanceAdmin",
"members": [
"group:my-group@example.com"
],
"condition": {
"title": "Dev_access_only",
"description": "Only access to devAccess* VMs",
"expression":
"(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /disks/ PREFIX ')) ||
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /instances/ PREFIX ')) ||
(resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' &&
resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk')"
}
}
]
}
}
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Note:
The following command assumes that you have logged in to
the gcloud CLI with your user account by running
gcloud init
or

APIs Explorer (browser)
Copy the request body and open the
method reference page .
The APIs Explorer panel opens on the right side of the page.
You can interact with this tool to send requests.
Paste the request body in this tool, complete any other required fields, and click Execute .
The response contains the updated allow policy.
Note: If you treat policies as code and store them in a version-control system, you should
store the policy that is returned, not the policy that you sent in the request.
Note : Resource names for Compute Engine VM instances contain
zone information for the instance. To give access to instances with a specific
prefix across different zones, enumerate all zone IDs in the condition
expression. For example, the following expression specifies instances with the
prefix devAccess in both ZONE_1 and
ZONE_2 :
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_1_ID /instances/devAccess') ||
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_2_ID /instances/devAccess')
Extract values from resource names
The previous examples show boolean comparisons between the resource name, or the
beginning of the resource name, and another value. In some cases, though, you
might need to compare a value with a specific part of the resource name that is
not at the beginning of the name.
You can use the extract() function and specify an
extraction template to extract the relevant part of the resource name as a
string. If necessary, you can convert the extracted string to another type, such
as a timestamp. After you extract a value from the resource name, you can
compare that value with other values.
Note: If you use the Google Cloud console to edit conditions, the extract()
function is available in the condition editor, but not in the expression
builder.
The following examples show condition expressions that use the
extract() function. For details about the extract() function, see the
IAM Conditions attribute reference .
Example: Match orders from the last 30 days
Suppose you store order information in multiple Cloud Storage buckets, and
the objects in each bucket are organized by date. A typical object name might
look similar to this example:
projects/_/buckets/acme-orders-aaa/objects/data_lake/orders/order_date=2019-11-03/aef87g87ae0876
You want to allow a principal to access any order from the last 30 days. The
following condition matches the Cloud Storage objects for these orders. It
uses the duration() and date() functions to subtract 30 days (2,592,000
seconds) from the request time, then compare that timestamp with the order date:
resource.type == 'storage.googleapis.com/Object' &&
request.time - duration('2592000s') < date(resource.name.extract('/order_date={date_str}/'))
For details about the date() and duration() functions, see the
date/time attribute reference .
Example: Match Compute Engine VMs in any location
Suppose you want to grant a project-level role to a principal for any
Compute Engine VM whose name starts with dev- , regardless of the VM's
location. You also want the principal to be able to use that role for all other
resource types.
The resource name for a VM uses a format similar to
projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /instances/ INSTANCE_ID .
The following condition evaluates to true for VMs with an instance name that
starts with the string dev- , and for all resource types other than VMs:
resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' ||
resource.name.extract('/instances/{name}').startsWith('dev-')
The text in curly brackets identifies the part of the resource name that is
extracted for comparison. In this example, the extraction template extracts any
characters after the first occurrence of the string /instances/ .
Important usage considerations for resource-based conditions
When adding a resource-based condition, it's important to consider how the
condition will affect the principal's permissions.
Inherited conditions
In addition to adding conditions to the allow policies of some service-specific resources, it's
possible to add conditional role bindings to resources at the organization, folder, or project
level. When added at the container resource level, the conditional role bindings are inherited by
other resources through the resource hierarchy .
Inherited conditions are useful when a resource doesn't allow conditions in their allow policies or
doesn't have an allow policy.
When you use attributes at the organization, folder, or project level, keep in mind that most
attributes are available only for specific resource types. If part of a condition uses an attribute
that isn't available for a resource, then that part of the condition is never interpreted as
granting access. For example, the condition resource.name.endsWith == devResource never
grants access to any IAM resource because IAM resources don't provide
the resource name.
To prevent this issue, use the resource
type and resource
service attributes to limit the scope of the condition. For example, the
following condition evaluates to true for all resource types
other than Compute Engine instances; in contrast, for Compute Engine
instances, the condition checks resource name:
resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' ||
resource.name.endsWith('devResource')
Custom roles
Consider the following example, which involves custom
roles . An administrator wants to create a
custom role that grants access to create VM instances, but only allows the user
to create VM instances in a project with a resource name that starts with the
name prefix staging , using the disks with the same name prefix.
To accomplish this goal, ensure that the granted role contains the
required permissions to create a VM instance, which
means permissions on disk and instance resource types. Then, ensure that the
condition expression checks the resource name for both disks and instances.
Beyond these two types, other permissions in the role are not granted.
The following condition expression will result in unexpected behavior.
Permissions to operate on Compute Engine VMs are blocked:
resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /disks/staging')
The following condition expression includes both disks and instances, and will
manage access based on the resource name for these two types:
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /disks/staging')) ||
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /instances/staging'))
The following condition expression includes both disks and instances, and will
manage access based on the resource name for these two types. For any other
resource type, the condition expression grants the role regardless of the
resource name:
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /disks/staging')) ||
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /instances/staging')) ||
(resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' &&
resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance')
Parent-only permissions
In Google Cloud's resource hierarchy, some of the permissions in a role
that affect a child resource are intended to be enforced at the parent level
only. For example, to list projects in an organization, a user must be
granted the resourcemanager.projects.list permission on the organization whose
projects they want to list, not on the projects themselves. These kinds of
permissions are called parent-only permissions , and only apply to list
operations.
To properly grant access to *.*.list permissions when using conditions, the
condition expression should set the resource.service and resource.type
attributes according to the parent resource type of the target resources to be
listed.
Note: To grant parent-only permissions on a resource, the service that owns the
resource must recognize the resource attributes used in the condition. For
example, you cannot use the resource.name attribute in a condition at the
project level, because Resource Manager, which manages projects, does not recognize
the resource.name attribute. For details about which services recognize these
attributes, see the resource attribute reference .
Consider the following examples. Using the Compute Engine example from
the preceding section, the following expression prevents access to
compute.disks.list and compute.instances.list permissions, since the
resource on which this permissions are checked have resource.type attribute
value of cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project .
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /disks/ PREFIX ')) ||
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /instances/ PREFIX '))
It is common that these list permissions are granted together with other
permissions for regular operations on the resource. To increase to scope of
grant in this case, you can either extend the scope for the
cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project type only, or extend the scope to
all other permissions not of type instance or disk.
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /disks/ PREFIX ')) ||
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /instances/ PREFIX ')) ||
resource.type == 'cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project'
or
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /disks/ PREFIX ')) ||
(resource.type == 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance' &&
resource.name.startsWith('projects/ PROJECT_ID /zones/ ZONE_ID /instances/ PREFIX ')) ||
(resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Disk' &&
resource.type != 'compute.googleapis.com/Instance')
