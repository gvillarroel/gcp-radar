This page explains how to use Credential Access Boundaries to create an OAuth
2.0 access token with downscoped Cloud Storage permissions.
The process for creating a token with downscoped permissions includes the
following steps:
Grant the appropriate IAM roles to a user
or service account.
Define a Credential Access Boundary that sets an upper
bound on the permissions that are available to the user or service account.
Create an OAuth 2.0 access token for the user or
service account.
Exchange the OAuth 2.0 access token for a new token
that respects the Credential Access Boundary.
You can then use the new downscoped OAuth 2.0 access token to authenticate
requests to Cloud Storage.
Before you begin
Before you use Credential Access Boundaries, make sure you meet the following
requirements:
You need to downscope permissions only for Cloud Storage, not for other
Google Cloud services.
If you need to downscope permissions for additional Google Cloud
services, you can create multiple service accounts and
grant a different set of roles to each service account.
You can use OAuth 2.0 access tokens for authentication.
Other types of short-lived credentials don't support Credential Access
Boundaries.
Also, you must enable the required APIs:
Enable the IAM and Security Token Service APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which
contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission. Learn how to grant
roles .
Enable the APIs
Grant IAM roles
A Credential Access Boundary sets an upper bound on the available permissions
for a resource. It can subtract permissions from a principal, but it can't add
permissions that the principal does not already have.
As a result, you must also grant roles to the principal that provide the
permissions they need, either
on a Cloud Storage bucket or
on a higher-level resource , such as the project.
For example, suppose you need to create a downscoped short-lived credential that
allows a service account to create objects in a bucket:
At a minimum, you must grant a role to the service account that includes the
storage.objects.create permission, such as the Storage Object Creator role
( roles/storage.objectCreator ). The Credential Access Boundary must also
include this permission.
You can also grant a role that includes more permissions, such as the Storage
Object Admin role ( roles/storage.objectAdmin ). The service account can use
only the permissions that appear in both the role grant and the Credential
Access Boundary.
To learn about predefined roles for Cloud Storage, see
Cloud Storage roles .
Define the Credential Access Boundary
A Credential Access Boundary is an object that contains a list of access
boundary rules . The rules are made up of parameters that specify the upper
bound of the permissions that are available to the user or service account. To
define a Credential Access Boundary, create a JSON object that lists the access
boundary rules and their parameters.
The following is an example of a Credential Access Boundary:
{
"accessBoundary" : {
"accessBoundaryRules" : [
{
"availablePermissions" : [
"inRole: ROLE_ID "
],
"availableResource" : "//storage.googleapis.com/projects/_/buckets/ BUCKET_NAME "
"availabilityCondition" : {
"expression" : " CONDITION "
}
]
}
}
Replace the following:
ROLE_ID : The ID of a predefined or custom role
that defines the upper bound on the available permissions for the resource.
For example, roles/storage.objectViewer . To specify multiple roles, add a
new line with an inRole: prefix followed by the role ID. Only the permissions
in the specified roles will be available.
BUCKET_NAME : The name of the
Cloud Storage bucket that the rule applies to.
CONDITION : Optional. A condition expression that
specifies the Cloud Storage objects where permissions are available.
For example, the following condition makes permissions available for objects
whose name starts with customer-a :
resource.name.startsWith('projects/_/buckets/example-bucket/objects/customer-a')
To learn more about how to create and customize credential access boundaries,
see Components of a Credential Access Boundary .
For examples of potential use cases for Credential Access Boundaries, see
Examples of Credential Access Boundaries .
Create an OAuth 2.0 access token
Before you create a downscoped short-lived credential, you must create a normal
OAuth 2.0 access token. You can then exchange the normal credential for a
downscoped credential. When you create the access token, use the OAuth 2.0 scope
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform .
To create an access token for a service account, you can
complete the server-to-server OAuth 2.0 flow , or you
can use the Service Account Credentials API to
generate an OAuth 2.0 access token .
To create an access token for a user, see
Obtaining OAuth 2.0 access tokens . You can also use
the OAuth 2.0 Playground to create an access token for your
own Google Account.
Exchange the OAuth 2.0 access token
After you create an OAuth 2.0 access token, you can exchange the access token
for a downscoped token that respects the Credential Access Boundary. This
process typically involves a token broker and a token consumer :
The token broker is responsible for defining the Credential Access Boundary
and exchanging an access token for a downscoped token.
The token broker can use a supported authentication library to
exchange access tokens automatically, or it can
call the Security Token Service to exchange tokens manually.
The token consumer requests a downscoped access token from the token broker,
then uses the downscoped access token to perform another action.
The token consumer can use a supported authentication library to
automatically refresh access tokens before they
expire. Alternatively, it can refresh tokens manually, or it can allow
tokens to expire without refreshing them.
There are two ways to exchange the access token for a downscoped token:
Client-side token exchange (recommended) : Clients obtain cryptographic
materials from the Security Token Service API server. The cryptographic materials allow
clients to generate downscoped tokens with varying Credential Access Boundary
rules independently on the client side for a set duration (for example, 1 hour).
This approach reduces latency and improves efficiency, especially for clients
requiring frequent Credential Access Boundary rule updates. It's also more
efficient for applications that need to generate many unique downscoped tokens.
This is the recommended approach because it provides better performance,
scalability, and future feature compatibility.
Server-side token exchange : Clients request a new downscoped token from
the Security Token Service API server whenever a Credential Access Boundary rule changes.
This approach is straightforward but requires a round trip to the Security Token Service
API server for each downscoped token request. This approach is recommended only
for customers who require a client library that doesn't support client-side
token exchange, due to the round trip to the Security Token Service API for each
downscoped token request.
Client-side token exchange
If you create the token broker and token consumer with the following
language, you can use Google's authentication library to exchange and refresh
tokens automatically through the client-side approach.
Java
For Java, you can exchange and refresh tokens automatically with version 1.32.1
or later of the
com.google.auth:google-auth-library-cab-token-generator artifact .
To check your artifact version, run the following Maven command in your
application directory:
mvn dependency:list -DincludeArtifactIds = google-auth-library-cab-token-generator
The following example shows how a token broker can generate downscoped tokens:
import com.google.auth.credentialaccessboundary. ClientSideCredentialAccessBoundaryFactory ;

// Only objects starting with the specified prefix string in the object name will be allowed
// read access.
String expression =

try {
return factory . generateToken ( credentialAccessBoundary );
} catch ( GeneralSecurityException | CelValidationException e ) {
throw new IOException ( "Error generating downscoped token" , e );
}
}
The following example shows how a token consumer can use a refresh handler to
automatically obtain and refresh downscoped tokens:
import com.google.auth.oauth2. AccessToken ;
import com.google.auth.oauth2. OAuth2CredentialsWithRefresh ;
import com.google.cloud.storage. Blob ;
import com.google.cloud.storage. Storage ;
import com.google.cloud.storage. StorageOptions ;
import java.io.IOException ;
public static String retrieveBlobWithDownscopedToken (
final String bucketName , final String objectName ) throws IOException {
// You can pass an `OAuth2RefreshHandler` to `OAuth2CredentialsWithRefresh` which will allow the
// library to seamlessly handle downscoped token refreshes on expiration.
OAuth2CredentialsWithRefresh . OAuth2RefreshHandler handler =
new OAuth2CredentialsWithRefresh . OAuth2RefreshHandler () {
@Override
public AccessToken refreshAccessToken () throws IOException {
// The common pattern of usage is to have a token broker pass the downscoped short-lived
// access tokens to a token consumer via some secure authenticated channel.
// For illustration purposes, we are generating the downscoped token locally.
// We want to test the ability to limit access to objects with a certain prefix string
// in the resource bucket. objectName.substring(0, 3) is the prefix here. This field is
// not required if access to all bucket resources are allowed. If access to limited
// resources in the bucket is needed, this mechanism can be used.
return DownscopedAccessTokenGenerator
. getTokenFromBroker ( bucketName , objectName );
}
};
AccessToken downscopedToken = handler . refreshAccessToken ();
OAuth2CredentialsWithRefresh credentials =
OAuth2CredentialsWithRefresh . newBuilder ()
. setAccessToken ( downscopedToken )
. setRefreshHandler ( handler )
. build ();
StorageOptions options = StorageOptions . newBuilder (). setCredentials ( credentials ). build ();
Storage storage = options . getService ();
Blob blob = storage . get ( bucketName , objectName );
if ( blob == null ) {
return null ;
}
return new String ( blob . getContent ());
}
Server-side token exchange
This section describes the following methods that you can use to exchange tokens
through the service side approach:
Exchange and refresh the access token automatically
Exchange and refresh the access token manually
Exchange and refresh the access token automatically using server-side approach
If you create the token broker and token consumer with one of the following
languages, you can use Google's authentication library to exchange and refresh
tokens automatically using the server-side token generation approach:
Go
For Go, you can exchange and refresh tokens automatically with version
v0.0.0-20210819190943-2bc19b11175f or later of the
golang.org/x/oauth2 package .
To check your package version, run the following command
in your application directory:
go list -m golang.org/x/oauth2
The following example shows how a token broker can generate downscoped tokens:

// createDownscopedToken would be run on the token broker in order to generate
// a downscoped access token that only grants access to objects whose name begins with prefix.
// The token broker would then pass the newly created token to the requesting token consumer for use.
func createDownscopedToken ( bucketName string , prefix string ) error {
// bucketName := "foo"
// prefix := "profile-picture-"
ctx := context . Background ()
// A condition can optionally be provided to further restrict access permissions.

Title : prefix + " Only" ,
Description : "Restricts a token to only be able to access objects that start with `" + prefix + "`" ,
}
// Initializes an accessBoundary with one Rule which restricts the downscoped
// token to only be able to access the bucket "bucketName" and only grants it the
// permission "storage.objectViewer".
accessBoundary := [] downscope . AccessBoundaryRule {
{
AvailableResource : "//storage.googleapis.com/projects/_/buckets/" + bucketName ,
AvailablePermissions : [] string { "inRole:roles/storage.objectViewer" },
Condition : & condition , // Optional
},
}
// This Source can be initialized in multiple ways; the following example uses
// Application Default Credentials.
var rootSource oauth2 . TokenSource
// You must provide the "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform" scope.

Exchange and refresh the access token manually
A token broker can use the Security Token Service API to exchange an access
token for a downscoped access token. It can then provide the downscoped token
to a token consumer.
To exchange the access token, use the following HTTP method and URL:
POST https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/token
Set the Content-Type header in the request to
application/x-www-form-urlencoded . Include the following fields in the request
body:
Fields
grant_type
string
Use the value
urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange .
options
string
A JSON-formatted Credential Access Boundary, encoded with
percent
encoding .
requested_token_type
string
Use the value
urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token .
subject_token
string
The OAuth 2.0 access token that you want to exchange.
subject_token_type
string
Use the value
urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token .
The response is a JSON object that contains the following fields:
Fields
access_token
string
A downscoped OAuth 2.0 access token that respects the Credential
Access Boundary.
expires_in
number
The amount of time until the downscoped token expires, in seconds.
This field is included only if the original access token represents a
service account. When this field is not included, the downscoped token
has the same time to expire as the original access token.
issued_token_type
string
Contains the value
urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token .
token_type
string
Contains the value Bearer .
For example, if a JSON-formatted Credential Access Boundary is stored in the file
./access-boundary.json , you can use the following
curl command to exchange the access token. Replace
original-token with the original access token:
curl -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-X POST \
https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/token \
-d "grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange&subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token&requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token&subject_token= original-token " \
--data-urlencode "options= $( cat ./access-boundary.json ) "
The response is similar to the following example:
{
"access_token" : "ya29.dr.AbCDeFg-123456..." ,
"issued_token_type" : "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token" ,
"token_type" : "Bearer" ,
"expires_in" : 3600
}
When a token consumer requests a downscoped token, the token broker responds
with both the downscoped token and the number of seconds until it expires. If
the token has expired, the server rejects the request. To refresh the
downscoped token, the consumer can request a downscoped token from the broker
before the existing token expires.
