Evidence snippets:
- Note: Some system entities are not available when you regionalize your agent deployment, and @sys.any is sometimes recommended as a workaround.
- The following lists the conversation control granularity of agent resources in increasing granularity order: Agents (one agent handles all conversations) Flows (one flow handles one or more related conversation topics) Pages (one page handles one or more related conversation turns) Routes (one route handles a user intent or condition check) Intent parameters versus form parameters The main way in which your system gets structured data from the end-user is with parameters .
- For example, the following table shows good and bad ways to annotate with the @sys.date system entity: Good Bad September 7th departure September 7th departure Leaving on July 4 Leaving on July 4 Use semantically meaningful annotations for system entities The semantic meaning of a training phrase part selected for an annotation can be affected by the rest of the text in a training phrase.
- For example: Annotated training phrase Semantic meaning of annotated text I am 7 years old A person's age The contract is valid for 7 years A time duration Dialogflow CX's machine learning models consider semantic meaning when matching system entities.
