Evidence snippets:
- It pairs a Google-built database engine with a cloud-based, multi-node architecture to deliver enterprise-grade performance, reliability, and availability or your most demanding applications.
- Automatic and adaptive database features The fully PostgreSQL-compatible database engine that powers every AlloyDB node has several features that continuously analyze the structure and frequency of the queries that your instances handle, using this information to suggest schema improvements or automatically apply optimizations: An index advisor helps you find opportunities to optimize your database schema using new indexes based on your usage patterns.
- For more information, see Create a ScaNN index . google ml integration : provides access to the AI functions, which enables ML model invocation from AlloyDB for tasks such as generating embeddings, semantic ranking, AI-based filters and joins, and text generation and summarization.
- Automatic memory and storage management systems take advantage of the Google-built, cloud-based environment that AlloyDB runs on, continuously allocating and releasing memory and storage as needed to keep your cluster running with optimal performance and resource efficiency.

Evidence snippets:
- The table also marks which extensions are included with AlloyDB Omni , the containerized edition of AlloyDB that you can run in your own Linux-based environment.
- This extension is used along with the vector extension to enhance vector search capabilities and provides support for storing and querying vector embeddings. bloom Provides an index access method based on Bloom filters. btree gin Provides sample GIN operator classes that implement B-tree equivalent behavior. btree gist Provides GiST index operator classes that implement B-tree equivalent behavior. citext Provides a case-insensitive character string type citext . cube Implements a data type cube for representing multidimensional cubes. dblink Provides functions to connect to PostgreSQL databases from within a database session. dict int An add-on dictionary template for full-text search that controls the indexing of integers. earthdistance Provides two approaches to calculating great circle distances on the surface of the Earth. fuzzystrmatch Provides several functions to determine similarities and distance between strings. google columnar engine Provides the columnar engine feature of AlloyDB, which handles HTAP (hybrid transactional analytical processing) and OLAP (online analytical processing) workloads very efficiently.
- Important: Before you can use CREATE EXTENSION to enable this extension, you must first set the database flag alloydb.enable pg squeeze to the value on in the AlloyDB instance where you want to use the extension. pg stat statements Provides a means for tracking execution statistics of all SQL statements executed. pg trgm Provides functions and operators for determining the similarity of alphanumeric text based on trigram matching, as well as index operator classes that support fast searching for similar strings. pg visibility Provides a way to examine the visibility map (VM) and the page-level visibility information of a table. pg wait sampling Provides the ability to collect sampling statistics of wait events.
- However, you can manually install PostGIS to an existing AlloyDB Omni installation. postgres fdw Provides a foreign-data wrapper that you can use to access data stored in external PostgreSQL servers. postgresql-hll Introduces a new data type, hll , which is a HyperLogLog data structure. prefix Provides prefix-matching, plus index support. rdkit Provides functions for comparing, manipulating, and identifying molecular structures. refint Includes functions to check foreign key restraints, the referencing table, and the referenced table. rum Implements support to create RUM indexes for high-performance full-text search.
