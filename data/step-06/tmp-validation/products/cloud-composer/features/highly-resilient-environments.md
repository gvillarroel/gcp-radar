# Highly resilient environments

Product: Cloud Composer
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Highly resilient environments provide stronger resilience characteristics for Cloud Composer environments; Highly resilient environments provide stronger resilience characteristics for Cloud Composer environments.

## Extended Definition

Highly resilient environments provide stronger resilience characteristics for Cloud Composer environments; Highly resilient environments provide stronger resilience characteristics for Cloud Composer environments.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { workloads config { scheduler { cpu = 2.5 memory gb = 2.5 storage gb = 2 count = 1 } triggerer { count = 1 cpu = 0.5 memory gb = 0.5 } dag processor { cpu = 1 memory gb = 2 storage gb = 1 count = 1 } web server { cpu = 1 memory gb = 2.5 storage gb = 2 } worker { cpu = 1 memory gb = 2 storage gb = 2 min count = 2 max count = 4 } } environment size = "ENVIRONMENT SIZE SMALL" node config { service account = " example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Step 4. (Optional) Enable high resilience mode Highly resilient (Highly Available) Cloud Composer environments are environments that use built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms that reduce the environment's susceptibility to zonal failures and single point of failure outages.
- Highly resilient environments require at least two DAG processors. --dag-processor-cpu specifies the number of CPUs for the DAG processor. --dag-processor-memory specifies the amount of memory for the DAG processor. --dag-processor-storage specifies the amount of disk space for the DAG processor. --web-server-cpu specifies the number of CPUs for the Airflow web server. --web-server-memory specifies the amount of memory for the Airflow web server. --web-server-storage specifies the amount of disk space for the Airflow web server. --worker-cpu specifies the number of CPUs for an Airflow worker. --worker-memory specifies the amount of memory for an Airflow worker. --worker-storage specifies the amount of disk space for an Airflow worker. --min-workers specifies the minimum number of Airflow workers.
- In Cloud Composer 3, highly resilient environments are available starting from Airflow builds composer-3-airflow-2.10.2-build.13 and composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.20.
- If you have at least one triggerer instance in your environment (or at least two in highly resilient environments), you can use deferrable operators in your DAGs .

- Final score: 159
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Highly resilient environments are more resilient to this issue, because their databases are located in two separate zones.
- Important: For production use cases, we highly recommend to use highly resilient environments .
- Example: // POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ /locations/ }/environments { "name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" , "config" : { "maintenanceWindow" : { "startTime" : "2023-01-01T01:00:00Z" , "endTime" : "2023-01-01T07:00:00Z" , "recurrence" : "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,WE,SA" }, "nodeConfig" : { "serviceAccount" : " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Terraform The maintenance window block specifies the maintenance windows for your environment: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = " ENVIRONMENT NAME " region = " LOCATION " config { maintenance window { start time = " DATETIME START " end time = " DATETIME END " recurrence = " MAINTENANCE RECURRENCE " } node config { service account = " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Replace: DATETIME START with the start date and time in the date/time input format .
- Example: // POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ /locations/ }/environments { "name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" , "config" : { "softwareConfig" : { "imageVersion" : "composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15" }, "nodeConfig" : { "serviceAccount" : " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Terraform To create an environment with default parameters is a specified location, add the following resource block to your Terraform configuration and run terraform apply . resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = " ENVIRONMENT NAME " region = " LOCATION " config { software config { image version = " IMAGE VERSION " } node config { service account = " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Important: You must specify an image version for Cloud Composer 1.
