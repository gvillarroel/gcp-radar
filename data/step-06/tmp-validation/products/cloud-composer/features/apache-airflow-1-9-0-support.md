- Apache Airflow Access Control is a feature of Airflow, with its own model of users, roles, permissions, which is different from IAM.
- Apache Airflow Access Control model allows to reduce visibility in Airflow UI and DAG UI based on user role.
- Apache Airflow Access Control uses resource-based permissions.

Evidence snippets:
- Cloud Composer 3 Cloud Composer 2 Cloud Composer 1 Apache Airflow includes a web user interface called Airflow UI , which you can use to manage Airflow DAGs, view DAG run logs, monitor Airflow, and perform administrative actions.
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { web server network access control { allowed ip range { value = "192.0.2.0/24" description = "example range" }, allowed ip range { value = "192.0.4.0/24" description = "example range 2" } } } What's next Airflow UI Access Control Troubleshooting Airflow web server issues Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- Example: // PATCH https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/example-project/ // locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment?updateMask= // config.webServerNetworkAccessControl { "config" : { "webServerNetworkAccessControl" : { "allowedIpRanges" : [ { "value" : "192.0.2.0/24" , "description" : "example range" }, { "value" : "192.0.4.0/24" , "description" : "example range 2" } ] } } } Terraform In the allowed ip range block, in the web server network access control specify IP ranges that can access web server. resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = " ENVIRONMENT NAME " region = " LOCATION " config { web server network access control { allowed ip range { value = " WS IP RANGE " description = " WS RANGE DESCRIPTION " } } } } Replace the following: WS IP RANGE : the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access the Airflow UI.
- The webServerNetworkAccessControl element must be present, but must not contain an allowedIpRanges element. { "config" : { "webServerNetworkAccessControl" : { "allowedIpRanges" : [ { "value" : " WS IP RANGE " , "description" : " WS RANGE DESCRIPTION " } ] } } } Replace the following: WS IP RANGE : the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access the Airflow UI.
