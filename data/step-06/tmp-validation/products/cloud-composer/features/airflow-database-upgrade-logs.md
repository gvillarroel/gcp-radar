Evidence snippets:
- Airflow 1.9.0 stores and expects the log names to be in the following format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06/1.log Airflow 1.10.x stores and expects the log names to be in the following format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log As a result, if you upgrade from Airflow 1.9.0 to Airflow 1.10.x and would like to read the log for a task executed with Airflow 1.9.0, the Airflow Web server will show the following error message: Unable to read remote log from BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log Workaround: Rename the logs generated by Airflow 1.9.0 in the Cloud Storage bucket using the format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log Cannot create Cloud Composer environments with the organization policy constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging enforced Cloud Composer environment creation fails if the constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging organization policy is enforced on the target project.
- Warnings about duplicate entries of 'echo' task belonging to the 'echo-airflow monitoring' DAG You might see the following entry in the Airflow logs: in query db.query(q) File "/opt/python3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/MySQLdb/ connections.py", line 280, in query mysql.connection.query(self, query) mysql exceptions.IntegrityError: (1062, "Duplicate entry 'echo-airflow monitoring-2020-10-20 15:59:40.000000' for key 'PRIMARY'") You can ignore these log entries, because this error doesn't impact Airflow DAG and task processing.
- Only the following list of Non-RFC 1918 ranges is supported in Cloud Composer: 100.64.0.0/10 192.0.0.0/24 192.0.2.0/24 192.88.99.0/24 198.18.0.0/15 198.51.100.0/24 203.0.113.0/24 240.0.0.0/4 Airflow UI does not show tasks logs when DAG Serialization is on in Composer 1.10.2 and Composer 1.10.3 Enabling DAG serialization in environments using Composer versions 1.10.2 and 1.10.3 prevents logs from showing in the Airflow web server.

Evidence snippets:
- Example: gcloud composer environments snapshots save \ example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ --snapshot-location "gs://example-bucket/environment snapshots" Example result: Response: '@type': type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.orchestration.airflow.service.v1.SaveSnapshotResponse snapshotPath: gs://example-bucket/environment snapshots/example-environment us-central1 2026-03-17T11-26-24 Prepare the destination database If you don't have a Cloud SQL instance, create one.
- DAG ( "airflow db connection example" , start date = datetime . datetime ( 2025 , 1 , 1 ), schedule = None , catchup = False ) as dag : SQLExecuteQueryOperator ( task id = "run airflow db query" , dag = dag , conn id = "airflow db" , database = SQL DATABASE , sql = "SELECT FROM dag LIMIT 10;" , ) For more information about using the SQLExecuteQueryOperator, see the How-to Guide for Postgres using SQLExecuteQueryOperator in the Airflow documentation.
- Example: gcloud sql instances create example-instance \ --database-version = POSTGRES 15 \ --cpu = 2 \ --memory = 4GB \ --storage-size = 100GB \ --storage-auto-increase \ --region = us-central1 \ --root-password = example password Run the following command to create a database named airflow db : gcloud sql databases create airflow db \ --instance = SQL INSTANCE NAME Replace the following: SQL INSTANCE NAME : name of the Cloud SQL instance.
- Example: gcloud sql import sql example-instance \ $( gcloud storage ls gs://example-bucket/environment snapshots/example-environment us-central1 2026-03-17T11-26-24/ .sql.gz ) \ --database = airflow db \ --user = postgres (Recommended) Revoke the bucket access after the import is complete We recommend revoking Cloud Storage bucket access permissions from the service account of your Cloud SQL instance after the import is completed.
