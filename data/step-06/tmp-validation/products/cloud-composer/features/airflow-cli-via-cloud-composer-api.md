Evidence snippets:
- It does not control other Airflow permissions such as access to connections, variables, and so on; it does not control access to gcloud CLI commands; it does not control access to the environment's bucket.
- Airflow UI Access Control does not apply to other interfaces that are available to users, such as Airflow CLI commands executed through gcloud CLI.
- To preregister a user with a custom role through Google Cloud CLI, run the following Airflow CLI command : gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ users create -- \ -r ROLE \ -e USER EMAIL \ -u USER EMAIL \ -f FIRST NAME \ -l LAST NAME \ --use-random-password # The password value is required, but is not used Replace the following: ENVIRONMENT NAME : the name of the environment LOCATION : the region where the environment is located ROLE : an Airflow role for the user, for example, Op USER EMAIL : the user's email address FIRST NAME and LAST NAME : user's first name and last name Example: gcloud composer environments run example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ users create -- \ -r Op \ -e "example-user@example.com" \ -u "example-user@example.com" \ -f "Name" \ -l "Surname" \ --use-random-password Remove users Deleting a user from Airflow does not revoke access for that user, because they are automatically registered again next time they access the Airflow UI.
- In Airflow 2 and 3, override the following Airflow configuration option: Section Key Value webserver rbac user registration role UserNoDags In Airflow 1, override the following Airflow configuration option: Section Key Value webserver rbac user registration role NoDags Make sure that users are registered in Airflow .
