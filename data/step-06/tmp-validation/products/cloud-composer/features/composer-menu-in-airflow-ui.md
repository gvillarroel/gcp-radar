## Step 02 Summary

The Airflow UI includes a Composer menu for accessing environment resources such as DAG files and logs.

## Extended Definition

The Airflow UI includes a Composer menu for accessing environment resources such as DAG files and logs.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 120
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Airflow workers or schedulers might experience issues when accessing the environment's Cloud Storage bucket Cloud Composer uses gcsfuse to access the /data folder in the environment's bucket and to save Airflow task logs to the /logs directory (if enabled).
- Airflow 1.9.0 stores and expects the log names to be in the following format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06/1.log Airflow 1.10.x stores and expects the log names to be in the following format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log As a result, if you upgrade from Airflow 1.9.0 to Airflow 1.10.x and would like to read the log for a task executed with Airflow 1.9.0, the Airflow Web server will show the following error message: Unable to read remote log from BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log Workaround: Rename the logs generated by Airflow 1.9.0 in the Cloud Storage bucket using the format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log Cannot create Cloud Composer environments with the organization policy constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging enforced Cloud Composer environment creation fails if the constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging organization policy is enforced on the target project.
- Add the cloud-airflow-prod@system.gserviceaccount.com service account as the member of your security perimeter by using the following configuration in the YAML conditions file: - members : - serviceAccount:cloud-airflow-prod@ system.gserviceaccount.com Cloud Composer 1 environment creation fails when the compute.requireOsLogin policy is enabled If compute.requireOsLogin policy is set to true in your project, then Cloud Composer 1 v1 environment creation operations fails.
- Only the following list of Non-RFC 1918 ranges is supported in Cloud Composer: 100.64.0.0/10 192.0.0.0/24 192.0.2.0/24 192.88.99.0/24 198.18.0.0/15 198.51.100.0/24 203.0.113.0/24 240.0.0.0/4 Airflow UI does not show tasks logs when DAG Serialization is on in Composer 1.10.2 and Composer 1.10.3 Enabling DAG serialization in environments using Composer versions 1.10.2 and 1.10.3 prevents logs from showing in the Airflow web server.
