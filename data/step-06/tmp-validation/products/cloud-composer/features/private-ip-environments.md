# Private IP environments

Product: Cloud Composer
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Private IP Cloud Composer environments are generally available; Private IP Cloud Composer environments are available in beta to isolate managed GKE and Cloud SQL resources from the public internet.

## Extended Definition

Private IP Cloud Composer environments are generally available; Private IP Cloud Composer environments are available in beta to isolate managed GKE and Cloud SQL resources from the public internet.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

(Optional) Specify maintenance windows By default, Cloud Composer 1 environments do not have defined maintenance windows if you create them using Google Cloud console, API, or Terraform.

(Optional) Enable high resilience mode Highly resilient (Highly Available) Cloud Composer environments are environments that use built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms that reduce the environment's susceptibility to zonal failures and single point of failure outages.
