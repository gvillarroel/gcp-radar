# Control plane patch version support

Product: Google Kubernetes Engine
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

GKE can keep an existing control plane patch version available longer to support large-scale upgrade and downgrade operations.

## Extended Definition

GKE can keep an existing control plane patch version available longer to support large-scale upgrade and downgrade operations.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

- For example, to measure the API server traffic per instance of the Kubernetes control plane, use the following PromQL query: sum by (instance) (increase(apiserver request total{cluster=" CLUSTER NAME "}[1m])) To query the unsuccessful requests, filter the code label for 4xx and 5xx values by using the following PromQL query: sum(rate(apiserver request total{code= "[45].."}[5m])) To query the successful requests, filter the code label for 2xx values by using the following PromQL query: sum(rate(apiserver request total{code= "2.."}[5m])) To query the rejected requests by the API server per instance of the Kubernetes control plane, filter the code label for the value 429 ( http.StatusTooManyRequests ) by using the following PromQL query: sum by (instance) (increase(apiserver request total{cluster=" CLUSTER NAME ", code="429"}[1m])) Saturation You can measure the saturation in your system by using the apiserver current inflight requests and apiserver storage objects metrics.

Evidence snippets:
- Create a cluster: gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER NAME \ --location = LOCATION \ --project = CLUSTER PROJECT ID \ --control-plane-disk-encryption-key = PATH TO DISK KEY \ --gkeops-etcd-backup-encryption-key = PATH TO ETCD BACKUP KEY \ --service-account-signing-keys = PATH TO SIGNING KEY VERSION \ --service-account-verification-keys = PATH TO VERIFICATION KEY VERSION \ --cluster-ca = PATH TO CLUSTER CA \ --etcd-peer-ca = PATH TO ETCD PEER CA \ --etcd-api-ca = PATH TO ETCD API CA \ --aggregation-ca = PATH TO AGGREGATION CA Replace the following: CLUSTER NAME : the name of your new cluster.
- Rotating your encryption keys requires additional steps to ensure that your control plane resources are re-encrypted with new key versions before the original key versions are destroyed.
- Requirements Control plane disk encryption with your own keys has the following requirements: Your cluster must run GKE version 1.31.1-gke.1846000 or later.
- In the output, check that the cluster creation parameters included a key path that corresponds to the key that you set up in Cloud KMS, like in the following example: lines omitted for clarity userManagedKeysConfig: { controlPlaneDiskEncryptionKey: "projects/ KEY PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY RING NAME /cryptoKeys/ KCP DISK KEY NAME " gkeopsEtcdBackupEncryptionKey: "projects/ KEY PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /keyRings/ KEY RING NAME /cryptoKeys/ ETCD BACKUP KEY NAME " } Use the gcloud CLI to verify keys To use the gcloud CLI to verify the encryption key, do the following: For the disk encryption key, run the following command: gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER NAME \ --location = LOCATION \ --format = "value(userManagedKeysConfig.controlPlaneDiskEncryptionKey)" For the etcd internal backup encryption key, run the following command: gcloud container clusters describe CLUSTER NAME \ --location = LOCATION \ --format = "value(userManagedKeysConfig.gkeopsEtcdBackupEncryptionKey)" Rotate etcd and control plane disk encryption keys Preview — customer-managed credential rotation This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms .
