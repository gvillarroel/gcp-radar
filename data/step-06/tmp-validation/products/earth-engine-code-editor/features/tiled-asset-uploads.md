Evidence snippets:
- The band order of the resulting asset is mixed from the input COGs (e.g. output band 0 is from Tileset 0, while output band 1 is from Tileset 1). request = { 'imageManifest' : { 'name' : f 'projects/ { ee project } /assets/cogdemo2' , 'uriPrefix' : 'gs://ee-docs-demos/external image demo/' , 'tilesets' : [ { 'id' : '0' , 'sources' : [ { 'uris' : [ 'b4b3b2.tif' ] } ] }, { 'id' : '1' , 'sources' : [ { 'uris' : [ 'b5b6b7.tif' ] } ] }, ], 'bands' : [ { 'id' : 'red' , 'tilesetId' : '0' , 'tilesetBandIndex' : 0 }, { 'id' : 'rededge3' , 'tilesetId' : '1' , 'tilesetBandIndex' : 2 }, { 'id' : 'rededge2' , 'tilesetId' : '1' , 'tilesetBandIndex' : 1 }, { 'id' : 'green' , 'tilesetId' : '0' , 'tilesetBandIndex' : 1 }, { 'id' : 'blue' , 'tilesetId' : '1' , 'tilesetBandIndex' : 0 }, { 'id' : 'rededge1' , 'tilesetId' : '0' , 'tilesetBandIndex' : 2 }, ], }, } pprint ( request ) Details on COG-backed assets Location The Cloud Storage bucket location must be one of: The US multi-region Any US dual-region that includes US-CENTRAL1 The region US-CENTRAL1 Storage class The storage class of the bucket must be "Standard storage".
- If no bands are specified, the resulting asset will contain all the bands of the GeoTIFF with the band names encoded in the GeoTIFF (in this case, "vis-red", "vis-green", and "vis-blue"). request = { 'imageManifest' : { 'name' : f 'projects/ { ee project } /assets/cogdemo1' , 'tilesets' : [ { 'id' : '0' , 'sources' : [ { 'uris' : [ 'gs://ee-docs-demos/COG demo.tif' ] } ] } ], 'properties' : { 'version' : '1.1' }, 'startTime' : '2016-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z' , 'endTime' : '2016-12-31T15:01:23.000000000Z' , }, } pprint ( request ) More than one Tileset It is possible to specify an ImageManifest with more than one Tileset where each band of the resulting asset is backed by one of the bands of a Tileset using the tilesetId and tilesetBandIndex fields.

Evidence snippets:
- The cancel sub-command cancels one or more running tasks. upload Uploads images or tables from Google Cloud Storage to Earth Engine, or creates assets backed by external images. image To upload an image asset using default settings: earthengine upload image --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/asset id gs://bucket/image.tif If you specify multiple input image files they will be interpreted as tiles of a single image asset.
- You can see a complete list of table upload options by visiting the Table Manifest guide or with: earthengine upload table -h external image To create an asset backed by an external image, run the upload image command with a manifest: earthengine upload external image --manifest /tmp/foo.json An example manifest is: { "name" : "projects/{project}/assets/cogdemo1" , "tilesets" : [ { "id" : "0" , "sources" : [{ "uris" : [ "gs://ee-docs-demos/COG demo.tif" ] }] } ], "properties" : { "source" : "https://code.earthengine.google.com/d541cf8b268b2f9d8f834c255698201d" }, "startTime" : "2016-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z" , "endTime" : "2016-12-31T15:01:23.000000000Z" } See the Cloud GeoTIFF guide and the Image Manifest guide for more details on constructing the manifest.
- The options are also described in the Image Manifest guide. table To upload a Shapefile, CSV, or TFRecord from Google Cloud Storage to an Earth Engine table asset, you can use any of: earthengine upload table --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/myUploadedShapefile gs://bucket/foo.shp earthengine upload table --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/myUploadedCSV gs://bucket/foo.csv earthengine upload table --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/myUploadedTFRecord gs://bucket/foo.tfrecord Note: when uploading Shapefiles, you only need to specify the path to the .shp file.
- For safety when deleting multiple assets, you can use the --dry run flag to verify exactly what will be deleted without actually deleting anything. set project Sets the Google Cloud project through which computation requests are routed. earthengine set project foo-project This command is needed prior to running commands that require Cloud functionality, for example model . task Prints information about or manages long-running tasks.

### Earth Engine Code Editor \_|\_ Google Earth Engine \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 53
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The Code Editor allows importing and managing your own image assets in the Asset Manager, and you can control script execution and appearance when sharing links.
- Use the Asset Manager (Figure 3) to upload and manage your own image assets in Earth Engine.
- Asset Manager (Assets tab) The Asset Manager is in the Assets tab in the left panel.
- Click the button on the right of the tool (which performs a Custom stretch to the supplied min and max range by default) to linearly stretch the display to either percentiles or standard deviations of image values in the display window.
