Evidence snippets:
- To Avoid Conflicts : If your application uses a connector version that is different from the connector version deployed on your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster , you must either: Create a new cluster with an initialization action that installs the connector version used by your application, or Include and relocate the connector classes and connector dependencies for the version you are using into your application's jar to avoid conflict between your connector version and the connector version deployed on your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster (see this example of dependencies relocation in Maven ).

- Data lineage is available for all Managed Service for Apache Spark Spark jobs except SparkR and Spark streaming jobs, and supports BigQuery and Cloud Storage data sources.
- Disable Spark data lineage on a job If Spark data lineage is enabled on a cluster, you can disable Spark data lineage on a job by passing the spark.extraListeners property with an empty value ("") when you submit the job. gcloud dataproc jobs submit spark \ --cluster = CLUSTER NAME \ --project PROJECT ID \ --region REGION \ --class CLASS \ --jars = gs:// APPLICATION BUCKET /spark-application.jar \ --properties = spark.extraListeners = '' Submit a Spark job When you submit a supported Spark job on a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster that was created with Spark data lineage enabled, Managed Service for Apache Spark captures and reports the data lineage information to the Data Lineage API. gcloud dataproc jobs submit spark \ --cluster = CLUSTER NAME \ --project PROJECT ID \ --region REGION \ --class CLASS \ --jars = gs:// APPLICATION BUCKET /spark-application.jar \ --properties = spark.openlineage.namespace = CUSTOM NAMESPACE ,spark.openlineage.appName = CUSTOM APPNAME Notes: Adding the spark.openlineage.namespace and spark.openlineage.appName properties, which are used to uniquely identify the job, is optional.
