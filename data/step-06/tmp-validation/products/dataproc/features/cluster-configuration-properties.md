Evidence snippets:
- Create a cluster with a YAML file Run the following gcloud command to export the configuration of an existing Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster into a cluster.yaml file. gcloud dataproc clusters export EXISTING CLUSTER NAME \ --region= REGION \ --destination= cluster.yaml Create a new cluster by importing the YAML file configuration. gcloud dataproc clusters import NEW CLUSTER NAME \ --region= REGION \ --source= cluster.yaml Note: During the export operation, cluster-specific fields, such as cluster name, output-only fields, and automatically applied labels are filtered.
- Click the cluster name to open the cluster details page where you can examine jobs, instances, and configuration settings for your cluster and connect to web interfaces running on your cluster.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT /regions/ REGION /clusters" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "name": "projects/ PROJECT /regions/ REGION /operations/b5706e31......", "metadata": { "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.dataproc.v1.ClusterOperationMetadata", "clusterName": " CLUSTER NAME ", "clusterUuid": "5fe882b2-...", "status": { "state": "PENDING", "innerState": "PENDING", "stateStartTime": "2019-11-21T00:37:56.220Z" }, "operationType": "CREATE", "description": "Create cluster with 2 workers", "warnings": [ "For PD-Standard without local SSDs, we strongly recommend provisioning 1TB ..."" ] } } Note: You can click the Equivalent REST or command line links at the bottom of the left panel of the Managed Service for Apache Spark Google Cloud console Create a cluster page to have the Console construct an equivalent API REST request or gcloud tool command to use in your code or from the command line to create a cluster.
- HTTP method and URL: POST https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT /regions/ REGION /clusters Request JSON body: { "project id":" PROJECT ", "cluster name":" CLUSTER NAME ", "config":{ "master config":{ "num instances":1, "machine type uri":"n1-standard-2", "image uri":"" }, "softwareConfig": { "imageVersion": "", "properties": {}, "optionalComponents": [] }, "worker config":{ "num instances":2, "machine type uri":"n1-standard-2", "image uri":"" }, "gce cluster config":{ "zone uri":" ZONE " } } } To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
