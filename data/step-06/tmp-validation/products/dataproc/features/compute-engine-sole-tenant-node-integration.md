Evidence snippets:
- This page describes the driver node group , which is a group of Compute Engine VMS that are assigned the Driver role for the purpose of running job drivers on the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /clusters" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "projectId": " PROJECT ID ", "clusterName": " CLUSTER NAME ", "config": { ... "auxiliaryNodeGroups": [ { "nodeGroup": { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /clusters/ CLUSTER NAME /nodeGroups/ NODE GROUP ID ", "roles": [ "DRIVER" ], "nodeGroupConfig": { "numInstances": SIZE , "instanceNames": [ " CLUSTER NAME -np-q1gp", " CLUSTER NAME -np-xfc0" ], "imageUri": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/cloud-dataproc-ci/global/images/dataproc-2-0-deb10-...-rc01", "machineTypeUri": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /zones/ REGION -a/machineTypes/n1-standard-4", "diskConfig": { "bootDiskSizeGb": 1000, "bootDiskType": "pd-standard" }, "managedGroupConfig": { "instanceTemplateName": "dataproc-2a8224d2-...", "instanceGroupManagerName": "dataproc-2a8224d2-..." }, "minCpuPlatform": "AUTOMATIC", "preemptibility": "NON PREEMPTIBLE" } }, "nodeGroupId": " NODE GROUP ID " } ] }, } Get driver node group cluster metadata You can use the gcloud dataproc node-groups describe command or the Managed Service for Apache Spark API to get driver node group metadata. gcloud gcloud dataproc node-groups describe NODE GROUP ID \ --cluster= CLUSTER NAME \ --region= REGION Required flags: NODE GROUP ID : You can run gcloud dataproc clusters describe CLUSTER NAME to list the node group ID.
- Execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers -Uri "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /clusters/ CLUSTER NAME nodeGroups/ Node GROUP ID " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /clusters/ CLUSTER NAME /nodeGroups/ NODE GROUP ID ", "roles": [ "DRIVER" ], "nodeGroupConfig": { "numInstances": 5, "imageUri": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/cloud-dataproc-ci/global/images/dataproc-2-0-deb10-...-rc01", "machineTypeUri": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /zones/ REGION -a/machineTypes/n1-standard-4", "diskConfig": { "bootDiskSizeGb": 1000, "bootDiskType": "pd-standard" }, "managedGroupConfig": { "instanceTemplateName": "dataproc-driver-pool-mcia3j656h2fy", "instanceGroupManagerName": "dataproc-driver-pool-mcia3j656h2fy" }, "minCpuPlatform": "AUTOMATIC", "preemptibility": "NON PREEMPTIBLE" } } Resize a driver node group You can use the gcloud dataproc node-groups resize command or the Managed Service for Apache Spark API to add or remove driver nodes from a cluster driver node group. gcloud gcloud dataproc node-groups resize NODE GROUP ID \ --cluster= CLUSTER NAME \ --region= REGION \ --size= SIZE Required flags: NODE GROUP ID : You can run gcloud dataproc clusters describe CLUSTER NAME to list the node group ID.
- Run the following gcloud CLI command to list the location of driver logs in Cloud Storage: gcloud dataproc jobs describe JOB ID \ --region= REGION The Cloud Storage location of driver logs is listed as the driverOutputResourceUri in the command output in the following format: driverOutputResourceUri: gs:// CLUSTER STAGING BUCKET /google-cloud-dataproc-metainfo/ CLUSTER UUID /jobs/ JOB ID Console To view node group cluster logs: Enable Logging .

Evidence snippets:
- User roles To get the permissions that you need to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: Dataproc Editor ( roles/dataproc.editor ) on the project Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) on the Compute Engine default service account Service account role To ensure that the Compute Engine default service account has the necessary permissions to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster, ask your administrator to grant the Dataproc Worker ( roles/dataproc.worker ) IAM role to the Compute Engine default service account on the project.
- "Managed Service for Apache Spark" is the new name for the product formerly known as "Dataproc on Compute Engine" (cluster deployment) and "Google Cloud Serverless for Apache Spark" (serverless deployment).
- Important: You must grant this role to the Compute Engine default service account, not to your user account.
- In the Create Dataproc cluster dialog, click Create in the Cluster on Compute Engine row.
