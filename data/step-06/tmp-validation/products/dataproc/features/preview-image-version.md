Evidence snippets:
- Create a new DPMS instance in the standby region: gcloud metastore services create ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --location= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --hive-metastore-version=3.1.2 Set the Hive data bucket as the default warehouse directory: gcloud metastore services update ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --location= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --update-hive-metastore-configs="hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=gs:// ${ PROJECT } -warehouse" Retrieve the path of the latest metadata backup: IMPORT DIR=gcloud storage ls gs:// ${ BACKUP BUCKET } sort -k 1 tail -1 IMPORT SQL=" ${ IMPORT DIR } hive.sql" echo ${ IMPORT SQL } Import the backed-up metadata into the new Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore instance: gcloud metastore services import gcs $ { DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ -- location = $ { DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ -- dump - type = mysql \ -- database - dump = $ { IMPORT SQL } \ -- import - id = import - $ ( date + "%Y-%m- %d -%H-%M-%S" ) Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster in the standby region (region B): gcloud dataproc clusters create ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --dataproc-metastore=projects/ ${ PROJECT } /locations/ ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } /services/ ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --region= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --image-version=2.0 Verify that the metadata was correctly imported: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --region ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --execute "select count( ) as num orders from orders;" The num orders output is most important to the tutorial.
- Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster In Cloud Shell, create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster and attach it to the DPMS instance: gcloud dataproc clusters create ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --dataproc-metastore=projects/ ${ PROJECT } /locations/ ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } /services/ ${ DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --image-version=2.0 Specify the cluster image as version 2.0 , which is the latest version available as of June 2021.
- 1 \ -- python - version 3 The composer image composer-1.17.0-preview.1-airflow-2.0.1 is the latest version as of publication.
- Populate the metastore In Cloud Shell, update the sample retail.hql provided in this tutorial's repository with the name of the Hive data bucket: sed -i -- 's/ ${ WAREHOUSE BUCKET } /'" $WAREHOUSE BUCKET "'/g' retail.hql Run the queries contained in the retail.hql file to create the table definitions in the metastore: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster= ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --file=retail.hql Verify that the table definitions were correctly created: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster= ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --execute=" desc departments; desc categories; desc products; desc order items; desc orders; desc customers; select count( ) as num departments from departments; select count( ) as num categories from categories; select count( ) as num products from products; select count( ) as num order items from order items; select count( ) as num orders from orders; select count( ) as num customers from customers; " The output resembles the following: +------------------+------------+----------+ col name data type comment +------------------+------------+----------+ department id int department name string +------------------+------------+----------+ The output also contains the number of elements in each table—for example: +----------------+ num customers +----------------+ 12435 +----------------+ Failing over to the standby region This section provides the steps to failover from the primary region (region A) to the standby region (region B).

- GsonBigQueryInputFormat provides Hadoop with the BigQuery objects in a JsonObject format via the following primary operations: Using a user-specified query to select BigQuery objects Splitting the results of the query evenly among Hadoop nodes Parsing the splits into Java objects to pass to the Mapper.

Evidence snippets:
- Managed Service for Apache Spark preview image versions New minor versions of Managed Service for Apache Spark images are available in a preview version prior to release in the standard minor image version track.
- Use a preview image to test and validate your jobs against a new minor image version prior to adopting the standard minor image version in production.
- For production environments, associate your cluster with a specific major.minor Managed Service for Apache Spark image version, as shown in the following gcloud CLI command. gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER NAME \ --region= region \ --image-version=2.0 Dataproc resolves the major.minor version to the latest sub-minor version version ( 2.0 is resolved to 2.0.x ).
- Use custom images when necessary If you have dependencies to add to the cluster, such as native Python libraries, or security hardening or virus protection software, create a custom image from the latest image in your target minor image version track.
