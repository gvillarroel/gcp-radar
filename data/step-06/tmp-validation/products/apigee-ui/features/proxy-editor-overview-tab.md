Evidence snippets:
- The text editor displays the XML code for the proxy, including the Spike Arrest policy step in the Response element of the PreFlow. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?> <SpikeArrest continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="SA-"> <DisplayName>SA-</DisplayName> <Properties/> <Identifier ref="request.header.some-header-name"/> <MessageWeight ref="request.header.weight"/> <Rate>30ps</Rate> </SpikeArrest> In the XML for the policy, change the value of the <Rate> element to 1pm (which translates into roughly two requests allowed every 60 seconds in the cloud).
- Select Proxy Endpoints > default > PreFlow in the left-hand pane: Note: You may need to expand the visual editor in the right-hand pane to see all the elements.
