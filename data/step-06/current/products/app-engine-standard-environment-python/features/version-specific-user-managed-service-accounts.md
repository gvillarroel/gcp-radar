# Version-specific user-managed service accounts

Product: App Engine standard environment Python
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

App Engine versions can be deployed with a specified user-managed service account to scope privileges per version; App Engine versions can be deployed with a specified user-managed service account to scope privileges per version.

## Extended Definition

App Engine versions can be deployed with a specified user-managed service account to scope privileges per version; App Engine versions can be deployed with a specified user-managed service account to scope privileges per version.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.
