- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- When your app is running on App Engine, the PORT environment variable is set for you, but when testing your app locally, you can set PORT to any preferred value.
- To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command: gcloud init Create your App Engine app and its associated resources.
- Write a basic web service for App Engine Learn how to write a web service and declare runtime settings.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 256
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The appengine-web.xml file can define environment variables that are set when the application is running. <env-variables> <env-var name="DEFAULT ENCODING" value="UTF-8" /> </env-variables> To avoid conflicts with your local environment, the development server does not set environment variables based on this file, and requires that the local environment have these variables already set to matching values. export DEFAULT ENCODING = "UTF-8" dev appserver war When deployed to App Engine, the environment is created with these variables already set.
- You should use the appengine-web.xml file for configuring your app only if you are migrating an existing app from the App Engine Java 8 runtime to the latest supported Java version and you want to use the legacy bundled services .
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- If you want to disallow the use of HTTPS for the application, put the following in the appengine-web.xml file: <ssl-enabled>false</ssl-enabled> There is no way to disallow HTTPS for some URL paths and not others in the Java runtime environment. <static-error-handlers> Optional.

Evidence snippets:
- REGION ID .r.appspot.com , run the following command: gcloud app browse What's next Serve your App Engine hosted website from a custom domain .
- Install and then initialize the Google Cloud CLI: Download the SDK Listing your Google Cloud console project IDs From the command line, run: gcloud projects list OK Creating a website to host on Google App Engine Basic structure for the project This guide uses the following structure for the project: app.yaml : Configure the settings of your App Engine application. www/ : Directory to store all of your static files, such as HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript. css/ : Directory to store stylesheets. style.css : Basic stylesheet that formats the look and feel of your site. images/ : Optional directory to store images. index.html : An HTML file that displays content for your website. js/ : Optional directory to store JavaScript files.
- Store this file in your www directory. < html > < head > < title>Hello , world ! < / title > < link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "/css/style.css" > < / head > < body > < h1>Hello , world ! < / h1 > < p > This is a simple static HTML file that will be served from Google App Engine . < / p > < / body > < / html > Deploying your application to App Engine When you deploy your application files, your website will be uploaded to App Engine.
- Before you begin Before you can host your website on App Engine: Create a new Google Cloud console project or retrieve the project ID of an existing project to use: Go to the Projects page Tip: You can retrieve a list of your existing project IDs with the gcloud command line tool .
