- For example: To update the default service of an App Engine app to accept traffic only from Cloud Load Balancing and VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update default --ingress = internal-and-cloud-load-balancing To update a service named "internal-requests" to accept traffic only from VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update internal-requests --ingress = internal-only Egress settings Note: Egress settings are not available for the PHP runtimes.
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
- For requests from other App Engine services or from Cloud Run or Cloud Run functions in the same project, connect the service or function to a VPC network and route all egress through the connector, as described in Connecting to a Shared VPC network .

Evidence snippets:
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Reference Send feedback Scheduling jobs with cron.yaml Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- If you also specify job retry limit , App Engine retries the cron job until it reaches both limits. min backoff seconds The minimum number of seconds to wait before retrying a cron job after it fails. max backoff seconds The maximum number of seconds to wait before retrying a cron job after it fails. max doublings The maximum number of times that the interval between failed cron job retries will be doubled before the increase becomes constant.
- On the first day of January, April, July, and October, it runs one time at 00:00: schedule : 1 of jan,april,july,oct 00:00 Specifying retries If a cron job's request handler returns a status code that is not in the range 200–299 (inclusive) App Engine considers that job to have failed.
- You can do so by validating an HTTP header and the source IP address for the request: Requests from the Cron Service will contain the following HTTP header: "X-Appengine-Cron" : "true" This and other headers are set internally by App Engine.
