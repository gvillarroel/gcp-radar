### "Scheduling jobs with cron.yaml \_|\_ App Engine standard environment \_\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/scheduling-jobs-with-cron-yaml](https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/scheduling-jobs-with-cron-yaml)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 51
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If you also specify job retry limit , App Engine retries the cron job until it reaches both limits. min backoff seconds The minimum number of seconds to wait before retrying a cron job after it fails. max backoff seconds The maximum number of seconds to wait before retrying a cron job after it fails. max doublings The maximum number of times that the interval between failed cron job retries will be doubled before the increase becomes constant.
- The following is an example cron.yaml file: cron : - description : "daily summary job" url : /tasks/summary schedule : every 24 hours - description : "monday morning mailout" url : /mail/weekly schedule : every monday 09:00 timezone : Australia/NSW - description : "new daily summary job" url : /tasks/summary schedule : every 24 hours target : beta The cron.yaml file uses the YAML syntax and consists of definitions for each of your cron jobs.
- Important considerations for target : If you have traffic splitting enabled, your job requests will not be split between the versions that you have configured: IP address splitting: Job requests from the Cron service are always sent from the same IP address and therefore, get routed to the same version every time.
- On the first day of January, April, July, and October, it runs one time at 00:00: schedule : 1 of jan,april,july,oct 00:00 Specifying retries If a cron job's request handler returns a status code that is not in the range 200–299 (inclusive) App Engine considers that job to have failed.

### "Structuring web services in App Engine \_|\_ App Engine standard environment\

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-required-2`
- Final score: 46
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Directory structure Each version of your App Engine service is defined in an app.yaml configuration file.
- Similarly, both service2 and service3 are in separate directories, which contain each service's files, although service3 includes two versions of the YAML configuration file: In the following example, a single service has the optional dispatch.yaml file and two configuration files that represent different versions of that service, service1.yaml and service2.yaml : Design considerations for instance uptime Hardware or software failures that cause early termination or frequent instance restarts can occur without warning and can take considerable time to resolve.
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Structuring web services in App Engine Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- If you host your app out of a version control system (VCS), for example GitHub, you can also structure your app to use separate directories in a repository, or use separate repositories for each service.

Evidence snippets:
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- Create a connector using an existing subnet : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create CONNECTOR NAME \ --region REGION \ --subnet SUBNET NAME \ --subnet-project HOST PROJECT ID \ --min-instances MIN \ --max-instances MAX \ --machine-type MACHINE TYPE Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : a name for your connector, matching Compute Engine naming conventions , with the additional requirements that the name must be less than 21 characters long, and that hyphens (-) count as two characters.
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
- However, if you create a connector in a service project and the connector targets a Shared VPC network in the host project, you must add firewall rules to allow necessary traffic for the connector's operation from the following ranges: Serverless infrastructure IP range : 35.199.224.0/19 Health check probe IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 , 35.191.192.0/18 , and 130.211.0.0/22 These ranges are used by the Google infrastructure underlying Cloud Run, Cloud Run functions, and App Engine standard environment.
