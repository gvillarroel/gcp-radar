Evidence snippets:
- To confirm service creation and version deployment: View your App Engine services in the Google Cloud console: View services You should see one service listed, named default .
- Create a new folder called go-app for your Go service: mkdir go-app In your go-app/ folder, create a file called app.yaml , and add the following contents: runtime : go126 # or another supported version This is the simplest configuration for an App Engine app.
- Deploy your web service on App Engine In your go-app directory where your app.yaml file is located, deploy your web service to App Engine using the following command: gcloud app deploy To launch your browser and view your web service at https:// PROJECT ID .
- Due to changes in the default behavior for how Cloud Build uses service accounts in new projects, and secure-by-default organization policy changes , you might need to grant additional roles to your deploying service account.

Evidence snippets:
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- The appengine-web.xml file can define environment variables that are set when the application is running. <env-variables> <env-var name="DEFAULT ENCODING" value="UTF-8" /> </env-variables> To avoid conflicts with your local environment, the development server does not set environment variables based on this file, and requires that the local environment have these variables already set to matching values. export DEFAULT ENCODING = "UTF-8" dev appserver war When deployed to App Engine, the environment is created with these variables already set.
- The appengine-web.xml file can define system properties and environment variables that are set when the application is running. <system-properties> <property name="myapp.maximum-message-length" value="140" /> <property name="myapp.notify-every-n-signups" value="1000" /> <property name="myapp.notify-url" value="http://www.example.com/signupnotify" /> </system-properties> <env-variables> <env-var name="DEFAULT ENCODING" value="UTF-8" /> </env-variables> Optional.

Evidence snippets:
- Examples: Use the following examples to help you create your firewall: Add a rule that allows an IPv6 address and subnet mask, and then test that rule to ensure it gets evaluated prior to your other rules: gcloud app firewall-rules create 123 --source-range fe80::3636:3bff:fecc:8778/128 --action allow gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip fe80::3636:3bff:fecc:8778 Add a rule to deny an IPv4 address and subnet mask, and then test that rule to ensure that it gets appropriately evaluated: gcloud app firewall-rules create 123456 --source-range "74.125.0.0/16" --action deny gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip 74 .125.0.8 Update and then test the default rule to ensure that it restricts all IP addresses that don't match any other rules: gcloud app firewall-rules update default --action deny gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip 123 .456.7.89 API To programmatically create firewall rules for your App Engine app, you can use the apps.firewall.ingressRules methods in the Admin API.
- 2147483647 Deny Default Action The engineer in the satellite office will not be able to access the company's app as the rule's new priority means it will never be evaluated.
- Before you begin Before you can create App Engine firewall rules for your app, you must have one of the following App Engine IAM roles , which include the necessary privileges for creating or modifying firewall rules: App Engine Admin Editor Owner Creating firewall rules Use one of the following methods to create a firewall rule.
- Run the following command to test your rule and ensure that the priority and action provide the expected behavior: gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip IP ADDRESS where IP ADDRESS is the IP address that you want to test against your firewall.
