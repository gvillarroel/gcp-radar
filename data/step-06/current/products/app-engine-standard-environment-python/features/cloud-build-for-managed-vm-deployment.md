- Recommended role for application deployment For an account that is responsible only for deploying new versions of an app, we recommend that you grant the following roles: App Engine Deployer role ( roles/appengine.deployer ) Service Account User role ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) The Service Account User role enables the account to impersonate the default App Engine service account during the deployment process.
- If the account uses gcloud commands to deploy, add these roles as well: Storage Object Admin ( roles/storage.objectAdmin ) Cloud Build Editor ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor ) To access data stored in Datastore, or update indexes, enable the Cloud Datastore Index Admin role ( roles/datastore.indexAdmin ).
