- For a deeper dive into how App Engine works, see the Go Runtime Environment .
- Create a new folder called go-app for your Go service: mkdir go-app In your go-app/ folder, create a file called app.yaml , and add the following contents: runtime : go126 # or another supported version This is the simplest configuration for an App Engine app.

Evidence snippets:
- Generally, your app.yaml file requires only the runtime element for a simple Go 1.12+ app in the standard environment, for example: runtime : go126 App Engine provides default values for all other settings, including the F1 instance class , which determines the memory and CPU resources that are available to your app, and automatic scaling , which controls how and when new instances of your app are created.
- An App Engine app is configured using an app.yaml file, that contains the runtime, handlers, scaling, and other general settings including environment variables.

- About app.yaml files You can specify the runtime configuration for your Go 1.12+ app, including versions and URLs, in the app.yaml file.
