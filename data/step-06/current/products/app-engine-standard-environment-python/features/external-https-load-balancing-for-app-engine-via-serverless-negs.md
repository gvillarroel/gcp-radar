- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 208
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If you want to disallow the use of HTTPS for the application, put the following in the appengine-web.xml file: <ssl-enabled>false</ssl-enabled> There is no way to disallow HTTPS for some URL paths and not others in the Java runtime environment. <static-error-handlers> Optional.
- For more information, see Cache expiration . <exclude> Files and directories matching <exclude> patterns won't be uploaded when you deploy your app to App Engine.
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- Example <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <application>simple-app</application> <module>default</module> <version>uno</version> <instance-class>B8</instance-class> <manual-scaling> <instances>5</instances> </manual-scaling> </appengine-web-app> Staging elements Much of the work done during a deployment occurs locally in a preparation step called staging , where JAR files are assembled, JSPs are compiled, and so forth.

Evidence snippets:
- Create a new folder called go-app for your Go service: mkdir go-app In your go-app/ folder, create a file called app.yaml , and add the following contents: runtime : go126 # or another supported version This is the simplest configuration for an App Engine app.
- Deploy your web service on App Engine In your go-app directory where your app.yaml file is located, deploy your web service to App Engine using the following command: gcloud app deploy To launch your browser and view your web service at https:// PROJECT ID .
- When your app is running on App Engine, the PORT environment variable is set for you, but when testing your app locally, you can set PORT to any preferred value.

- Re-rank relevance: WEAK
- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- For example, you can create a dispatch file to route mobile requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/mobile/ to a mobile frontend, and route worker requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/work/ to a static backend: dispatch: Send all mobile traffic to the mobile frontend. - url: " /mobile/ " service: mobile-frontend Send all work to the one static backend. - url: " /work/ " service: static-backend Deploying the dispatch file To deploy the dispatch file using gcloud, run the following command: gcloud app deploy dispatch.yaml Routing with Cloud Load Balancing Cloud Load Balancing is a separate product that enables advanced network configurations for all of your applications running on Google Cloud.
- When HTTP(S) Load Balancing is enabled for serverless apps , you can: Configure your serverless app to serve from a dedicated IPv4 or IPv6 IP address that is not shared with other services.
- Requests that don't pass through Cloud Load Balancing are never intercepted and rerouted by the patterns that you have defined in your dispatch file: Sends the request to an available instance of a specific service and version: https:// VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT ID .
- Example URLs Here are some examples of URLs for App Engine, showing both the appspot.com domain that App Engine assigns to your app and a custom domain, which you can set up for your app .
