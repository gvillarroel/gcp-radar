Evidence snippets:
- However, if you create a connector in a service project and the connector targets a Shared VPC network in the host project, you must add firewall rules to allow necessary traffic for the connector's operation from the following ranges: Serverless infrastructure IP range : 35.199.224.0/19 Health check probe IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 , 35.191.192.0/18 , and 130.211.0.0/22 These ranges are used by the Google infrastructure underlying Cloud Run, Cloud Run functions, and App Engine standard environment.
- This page shows how to use Serverless VPC Access to connect your App Engine services in the standard environment directly to your VPC network, allowing access to Compute Engine VM instances, Memorystore instances, and any other resources with an internal IP address.

Evidence snippets:
- One of the benefits App Engine standard environment's "pay for only what you need" platform as described earlier in Scaling Down is that the system autoscales the number of instances down to zero when there is no traffic.

- Note: For new projects you create after March 2025, App Engine sets the automatic scaling maximum instances default for standard environment deployments to 20.
- NTP with App Engine standard environment The App Engine standard environment has network time protocol (NTP) services which use Google NTP servers.
