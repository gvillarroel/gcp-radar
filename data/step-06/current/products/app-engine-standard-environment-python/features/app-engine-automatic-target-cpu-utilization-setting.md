- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Automatic scaling settings Description Target CPU utilization Sets the CPU utilization ratio threshold to specify the CPU usage threshold at which more instances will be started to handle traffic.
- Scaling types App Engine supports the following scaling types , which controls how and when instances are created: Automatic (default) Basic Manual You specify the scaling type in your app's app.yaml .
- Scaling dynamic instances App Engine applications that use basic or automatic scaling are powered by any number of dynamic instances at a given time, depending on the volume of incoming requests.
- Note: For new projects you create after March 2025, App Engine sets the automatic scaling maximum instances default for standard environment deployments to 20.

Evidence snippets:
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
- However, if you create a connector in a service project and the connector targets a Shared VPC network in the host project, you must add firewall rules to allow necessary traffic for the connector's operation from the following ranges: Serverless infrastructure IP range : 35.199.224.0/19 Health check probe IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 , 35.191.192.0/18 , and 130.211.0.0/22 These ranges are used by the Google infrastructure underlying Cloud Run, Cloud Run functions, and App Engine standard environment.
- The name of the new subnet begins with the "aet-" prefix. (Optional) To set scaling options for additional control over the connector, click Show Scaling Settings to display the scaling form.
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.

Evidence snippets:
- However, this is bound by the following restrictions: App Engine reserves automatic scaling capacity for applications with low latency, where the application responds to requests in less than one second.
- You can configure startup instructions by adding entrypoint to app.yaml. app . run ( host = "127.0.0.1" , port = 8080 , debug = True ) Quotas and limits App Engine automatically allocates resources to your application as traffic increases.
- You can also change the number of concurrent requests an instance can handle by setting the max concurrent requests element in your app.yaml file , or appengine-web.xml file file if using the App Engine legacy bundled services.
- If you don't set this header in app.yaml , App Engine automatically adds it for all responses handled by a static file or directory handler.
