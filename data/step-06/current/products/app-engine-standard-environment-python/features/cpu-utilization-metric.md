# CPU Utilization metric

Product: App Engine standard environment Python
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

App Engine standard environment provides a CPU Utilization metric that reports average CPU usage across active instances.

## Extended Definition

App Engine standard environment provides a CPU Utilization metric that reports average CPU usage across active instances.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

- To display charts for the connector's throughput, number of instances, and CPU utilization metrics over time by using the Google Cloud console: Go to the Serverless VPC Access overview page.
- Test the custom constraint To test the example that restricts ingress settings, deploy a connector in the project with network set to default : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create org-policy-test \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION ID \ --network = default The output is the following: Operation denied by custom org policies: ["customConstraints/custom.defaultNetworkConstraint": "Require network to not be set to default."] Example custom organization policies for common use cases The following table provides examples of custom constraints that you might find useful with Serverless VPC Access connectors: Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors can only use a specific network. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.allowlistNetworks resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.network == 'allowlisted-network'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : allowlistNetworks description : Require connectors to use a specific network.
- Update a connector You can update and monitor the following attributes of your connector by using the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or the API: Machine (instance) type Minimum and maximum number of instances Recent throughput, number of instances, and CPU utilization Update machine type Caution: Changing machine type can cause some long-running connections to drop.
- Poor network performance or high idle CPU utilization Using a single connector for thousands of instances can cause performance degradation and elevated idle CPU utilization.
