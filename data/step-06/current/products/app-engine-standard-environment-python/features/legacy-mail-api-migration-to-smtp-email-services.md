- In this guide, you iterate through building and deploying versions of a web service, starting from a static page and building up to a personalized web page that shows authenticated users their name, their email, and their recent site request times.
- Use this guide to learn the basics of developing and deploying Python web services to the App Engine standard environment .
- The following tasks demonstrate the basic developer flow for creating that web service using Firestore in Datastore mode (Datastore) data storage and Firebase authentication : Create your Google Cloud project Learn how to create a Google Cloud project and then set up the App Engine resources for your web service.

Evidence snippets:
- To reduce runtime migration complexity, Google Cloud now supports a set of App Engine legacy bundled services and their associated APIs on second-generation runtimes, which include Python 3 , Java 11+ , Go 1.12+ , and PHP 7+ .
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Overview of legacy bundled services Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- How apps access the App Engine legacy bundled services In runtime migration scenarios, you often also have the option to use Google Cloud products that offer similar functionality as the legacy bundled services.
- Because several of the legacy runtimes are no longer maintained by their respective open-source communities, as an App Engine developer, you may face hard choices on whether to invest time and effort in migrating to a newer runtime or else incur growing costs to retain your app on a legacy runtime.
