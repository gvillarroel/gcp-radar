Evidence snippets:
- About the cron configuration file For all runtimes except for Java, a cron.yaml file in the root directory of your application (alongside app.yaml ) configures scheduled tasks for your app.
- For the Java, a cron.yaml file in the WEB-INF directory of your application (alongside apppengine-web.xml ) configures scheduled tasks for your app.
- The App Engine Cron Service allows you to configure regularly scheduled tasks that operate at defined times or regular intervals.
- The following is an example cron.yaml file: cron : - description : "daily summary job" url : /tasks/summary schedule : every 24 hours - description : "monday morning mailout" url : /mail/weekly schedule : every monday 09:00 timezone : Australia/NSW - description : "new daily summary job" url : /tasks/summary schedule : every 24 hours target : beta The cron.yaml file uses the YAML syntax and consists of definitions for each of your cron jobs.

Evidence snippets:
- The following limits apply to task queues according to their type: Push Queue Limits Maximum task size 100KB Queue execution rate 500 task invocations per second per queue Maximum countdown/ETA for a task 30 days from the current date and time Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a batch 100 tasks Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a transaction 5 tasks Default maximum number of task queues 100 queues.
- Task Queue When a task executes, its associated requests count toward the application request quotas These limits apply to all task queues: Resource Daily limit Maximum rate Task Queue management calls (using the Google Cloud console) 10,000 n/a Resource Default limit Maximum number of queues (includes both push and pull queues but not the default queue) 100 queues.
- Resource Default limit Cron job 250 cron jobs URL Fetch URL Fetch API calls The total number of times the application accessed the URL fetch service to perform an HTTP or HTTPS request.
- Resource Daily limit Maximum rate UrlFetch API calls 860,000,000 calls 660,000 calls/minute UrlFetch data sent 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute UrlFetch data received 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute Networking limits The following networking limits apply to App Engine: Outbound connections per second per instance: 500 (cannot be increased) Outbound DNS resolutions per second per instance: 100 (cannot be increased) Maximum packets per second per instance: 80,000 Maximum bits per second per instance: 100,000,000 Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
