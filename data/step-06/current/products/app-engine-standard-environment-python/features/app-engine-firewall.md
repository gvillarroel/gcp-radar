Evidence snippets:
- Examples: Use the following examples to help you create your firewall: Add a rule that allows an IPv6 address and subnet mask, and then test that rule to ensure it gets evaluated prior to your other rules: gcloud app firewall-rules create 123 --source-range fe80::3636:3bff:fecc:8778/128 --action allow gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip fe80::3636:3bff:fecc:8778 Add a rule to deny an IPv4 address and subnet mask, and then test that rule to ensure that it gets appropriately evaluated: gcloud app firewall-rules create 123456 --source-range "74.125.0.0/16" --action deny gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip 74 .125.0.8 Update and then test the default rule to ensure that it restricts all IP addresses that don't match any other rules: gcloud app firewall-rules update default --action deny gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip 123 .456.7.89 API To programmatically create firewall rules for your App Engine app, you can use the apps.firewall.ingressRules methods in the Admin API.
- Enter the IP address that you want to validate and then click Test to ensure that the corresponding rule gets correctly evaluated. gcloud Run the following gcloud app firewall-rules commands to create a firewall rule: Run the following command to create a firewall rule: gcloud app firewall-rules create PRIORITY --action ALLOW OR DENY --source-range IP RANGE --description DESCRIPTION where: PRIORITY is an integer between 1 and 2147483646 that defines the rule's importance and order for which the rule is evaluated.
- Before you begin Before you can create App Engine firewall rules for your app, you must have one of the following App Engine IAM roles , which include the necessary privileges for creating or modifying firewall rules: App Engine Admin Editor Owner Creating firewall rules Use one of the following methods to create a firewall rule.
- Understanding App Engine firewall rules An App Engine firewall consists of an ordered list of rules that can allow or deny access from the specified IP address or range to your app.

Evidence snippets:
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- If for some reason you prefer that your app not use precompilation, you can turn it off by adding the following to your appengine-web.xml file: <precompilation-enabled>false</precompilation-enabled> <module> Note: Modules are now named Services and services are still declared in appengine-web.xml files as modules, for example: <module>service name</module> .
- To determine how long a connection remains inactive without any data transmission before the client closes it, configure an idle timeout using the following syntax: <env-variables> <env-var name="APPENGINE API CALLS IDLE TIMEOUT MS" value="TIMEOUT IN MS" /> </env-variables> Replace TIMEOUT IN MS with the required timeout in milliseconds.
- It's possible to reduce request latency by configuring your application to asynchronously write HTTP session data to the Datastore: <async-session-persistence enabled="true" /> With async session persistence turned on, App Engine will submit a Task Queue task to write session data to the Datastore before writing the data to memcache.
