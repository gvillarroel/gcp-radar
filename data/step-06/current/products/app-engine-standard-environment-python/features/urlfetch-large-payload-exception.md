# URLFetch large payload exception

Product: App Engine standard environment Python
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

URLFetch requests now raise RequestPayloadTooLargeException for payloads that are too large.

## Extended Definition

URLFetch requests now raise RequestPayloadTooLargeException for payloads that are too large.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

Evidence snippets:
- Because App Engine keeps idle instances in reserve, it is unlikely that requests will enter the pending queue except in exceptionally high load spikes.
- To use this setting, you must enable billing for your app, or you will get exceptions, which are documented in Issue requests .
- The following example demonstrates how to designate all png files as static files (except those in the data/ directory and all of its subdirectories): < static - files > < include path = "/ .png" / > < exclude path = "/data/ .png" / > < / static - files > You can also set HTTP headers to use when responding to requests to these static resources. < static - files > < include path = "/my static-files" > < http - header name = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value = "http://example.org" / > < / include > < / static - files > Note: If the path string doesn't start with a slash, then the HTTP headers, if any, work on App Engine but do not work on the Development Server.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- App Engine pending queue prioritization During periods of heavy traffic, App Engine might place requests in a pending queue while waiting for an available instance with the following prioritization: App Engine prioritizes other queued requests over pending queued requests from Task queue .
- You can also change the number of concurrent requests an instance can handle by setting the max concurrent requests element in your app.yaml file , or appengine-web.xml file file if using the App Engine legacy bundled services.
- All subsequent requests for this URL that contain the Accept-Encoding: gzip header will receive the gzipped data from the cache until the cache becomes invalidated (due to the content changing after the cache expires).

### "Connecting to a VPC network \_|\_ App Engine standard environment \_|\_\

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 56
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Using the urlfetch library ignores egress settings, and requests will not route through a Serverless VPC Access connector.
- To perform these steps, you must have one of the following roles on the host project: Owner role ( roles/owner ) Compute Security Admin role ( roles/compute.securityAdmin ) Custom Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the compute.firewalls.create permission enabled For a basic configuration, apply the rules to allow serverless resources in any service project connected to the Shared VPC network to send requests to any resource in the network.
- Create an egress firewall rule on your Serverless VPC Access connector to prevent it from sending outgoing traffic, with the exception of established responses, to any destination. gcloud compute firewall-rules create RULE NAME \ --action = DENY \ --rules = PROTOCOL \ --direction = EGRESS \ --target-tags = VPC CONNECTOR NETWORK TAG \ --network = VPC NETWORK \ --priority = PRIORITY Replace the following: RULE NAME : the name of your new firewall rule.
- Create an ingress firewall rule on your VPC network to allow requests from connectors that target this network: gcloud compute firewall-rules create vpc-connector-requests \ --allow tcp,udp,icmp \ --direction = INGRESS \ --source-tags vpc-connector \ --network = VPC NETWORK This rule gives the connector access to every resource in the network.
