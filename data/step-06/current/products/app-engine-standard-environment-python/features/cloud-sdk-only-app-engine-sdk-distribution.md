- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-required-2`
- Final score: 60
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Your instance is moved to a different machine, either because the current machine that is running the instance is restarted, or App Engine moved your instance to improve load distribution.
- One of the benefits App Engine standard environment's "pay for only what you need" platform as described earlier in Scaling Down is that the system autoscales the number of instances down to zero when there is no traffic.
- Click the tab for instructions on using the tool of your choice: Console To stop or disable a version for your service: Go to the App Engine Versions page in the Google Cloud console: Go to Versions Select a version from the table, and click Stop . gcloud Run the following: gcloud app versions stop --service= SERVICE VERSION Replace: SERVICE with the name of your service.
- Click the tab for instructions on using the tool of your choice: Console To delete a service: Go to the App Engine Services page in the Google Cloud console: Go to Services Select a service from the table, and click Delete . gcloud Run the following: gcloud app services delete SERVICE Replace: SERVICE with the name of your service.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-required-7`
- Final score: 56
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Query ( "name:x86" , return facets = [ "type" , "ram size gb" ]) results = index . search ( query ) for facet in results . facets : print ( "facet {} " . format ( facet . name )) for value in facet . values : print ( " {} : count= {} , refinement token= {} " . format ( value . label , value . count , value . refinement token ) ) When you retrieve facets by name, by default only the 10 most often occurring values for a facet will be returned.
- Query ( "name:x86" , enable facet discovery = True ) results = index . search ( query ) for facet in results . facets : print ( "facet {} ." . format ( facet . name )) for value in facet . values : print ( " {} : count= {} , refinement token= {} " . format ( value . label , value . count , value . refinement token ) ) When you retrieve facets by discovery, by default only the 10 most often occurring values for a facet will be returned.
- Selecting facets by name and value To retrieve information only about particular values of a facet, add a return facets parameter that includes a FacetRequest object with a values list: def facet by name and value ( index ): Create the query and specify to return the "type" facet with values "computer" and "printer" and the "ram size gb" facet with value in the ranges [0,4), [4, 8), and [8, max]. query = search .
- Selecting facets by name To retrieve information about a facet by its name only, add a return facets parameter to your query, including the facet name in the list: def facet by name ( index ): Create the query and specify to only return the "type" and "ram size gb" facets. query = search .

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-required-2`
- Final score: 43
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- Test the custom constraint To test the example that restricts ingress settings, deploy a connector in the project with network set to default : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create org-policy-test \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION ID \ --network = default The output is the following: Operation denied by custom org policies: ["customConstraints/custom.defaultNetworkConstraint": "Require network to not be set to default."] Example custom organization policies for common use cases The following table provides examples of custom constraints that you might find useful with Serverless VPC Access connectors: Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors can only use a specific network. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.allowlistNetworks resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.network == 'allowlisted-network'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : allowlistNetworks description : Require connectors to use a specific network.
- Create a connector using an existing subnet : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create CONNECTOR NAME \ --region REGION \ --subnet SUBNET NAME \ --subnet-project HOST PROJECT ID \ --min-instances MIN \ --max-instances MAX \ --machine-type MACHINE TYPE Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : a name for your connector, matching Compute Engine naming conventions , with the additional requirements that the name must be less than 21 characters long, and that hyphens (-) count as two characters.
