- Click the tab for instructions on using the tool of your choice: Console To stop or disable a version for your service: Go to the App Engine Versions page in the Google Cloud console: Go to Versions Select a version from the table, and click Stop . gcloud Run the following: gcloud app versions stop --service= SERVICE VERSION Replace: SERVICE with the name of your service.
- Click the tab for instructions on using the tool of your choice: Console To delete a service: Go to the App Engine Services page in the Google Cloud console: Go to Services Select a service from the table, and click Delete . gcloud Run the following: gcloud app services delete SERVICE Replace: SERVICE with the name of your service.
- You can: Use the Versions page in the Google Cloud console Use gcloud app versions start and gcloud app versions stop commands Startup Each service instance is created in response to a start request, which is an empty HTTP GET request to / ah/start .
- Automatic scaling settings Description Target CPU utilization Sets the CPU utilization ratio threshold to specify the CPU usage threshold at which more instances will be started to handle traffic.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-4`
- Final score: 55
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The Cloud Quotas system does the following: Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services Restricts your consumption of those resources Provides a way to request changes to the quota value and automate quota adjustments In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that you're trying to perform fails.
- Task Queue When a task executes, its associated requests count toward the application request quotas These limits apply to all task queues: Resource Daily limit Maximum rate Task Queue management calls (using the Google Cloud console) 10,000 n/a Resource Default limit Maximum number of queues (includes both push and pull queues but not the default queue) 100 queues.
- Resource or API call Free Quota Total storage (documents and indexes) 0.25 GB Queries 1000 queries per day Adding documents to indexes 0.01 GB per day The application console quota section displays a raw count of API requests.
- If the number of idle instances created by App Engine exceeds the maximum you specify in the Performance Settings tab of the Google Cloud console, the excess instances do not accrue instance hours.
