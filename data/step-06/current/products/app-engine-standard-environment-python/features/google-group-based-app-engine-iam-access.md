# Google Group-based App Engine IAM access

Product: App Engine standard environment Python
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

App Engine applications can grant role access to all members of a Google Group by adding the group to the project.

## Extended Definition

App Engine applications can grant role access to all members of a Google Group by adding the group to the project.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

Evidence snippets:
- The following example demonstrates how to designate all png files as static files (except those in the data/ directory and all of its subdirectories): < static - files > < include path = "/ .png" / > < exclude path = "/data/ .png" / > < / static - files > You can also set HTTP headers to use when responding to requests to these static resources. < static - files > < include path = "/my static-files" > < http - header name = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value = "http://example.org" / > < / include > < / static - files > Note: If the path string doesn't start with a slash, then the HTTP headers, if any, work on App Engine but do not work on the Development Server.
- The appengine-web.xml file can define environment variables that are set when the application is running. <env-variables> <env-var name="DEFAULT ENCODING" value="UTF-8" /> </env-variables> To avoid conflicts with your local environment, the development server does not set environment variables based on this file, and requires that the local environment have these variables already set to matching values. export DEFAULT ENCODING = "UTF-8" dev appserver war When deployed to App Engine, the environment is created with these variables already set.
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- The appengine-web.xml file can define system properties and environment variables that are set when the application is running. <system-properties> <property name="myapp.maximum-message-length" value="140" /> <property name="myapp.notify-every-n-signups" value="1000" /> <property name="myapp.notify-url" value="http://www.example.com/signupnotify" /> </system-properties> <env-variables> <env-var name="DEFAULT ENCODING" value="UTF-8" /> </env-variables> Optional.

- When your app is running on App Engine, the PORT environment variable is set for you, but when testing your app locally, you can set PORT to any preferred value.
- Create a new folder called go-app for your Go service: mkdir go-app In your go-app/ folder, create a file called app.yaml , and add the following contents: runtime : go126 # or another supported version This is the simplest configuration for an App Engine app.
- Deploy your web service on App Engine In your go-app directory where your app.yaml file is located, deploy your web service to App Engine using the following command: gcloud app deploy To launch your browser and view your web service at https:// PROJECT ID .

Evidence snippets:
- A service account can be used to authenticate from the following tools: gcloud CLI IDEs and build tools that use gcloud CLI tools to test and deploy App Engine apps Creating a user account Open the IAM page in the Google Cloud console.

- If you need to use a unique identity for a version of your App Engine app when accessing other Google Cloud services or executing tasks, you can specify a user-managed service account in App Engine.
- In App Engine, there are a few separate use cases for setting up access control: Granting team members access to your Google Cloud project so they can set up services and deploy apps.
