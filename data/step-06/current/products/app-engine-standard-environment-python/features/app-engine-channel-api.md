Evidence snippets:
- When a namespace aware class (e.g., com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Key , com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Query and com.google.appengine.api.memcache.MemcacheService ) is constructed, it determines which namespace will be used by calling NamespaceManager#get() if it is otherwise unspecified.
- See Also: Multitenancy and the Namespaces Java API in the Google App Engine Developer's Guide .
- The Task Queue com.google.appengine.api.taskqueue.Queue#add methods will forward the NamespaceManager settings into the task being added causing the added task to be executed with the same current namespace as the task creator.

Evidence snippets:
- Create a new folder called go-app for your Go service: mkdir go-app In your go-app/ folder, create a file called app.yaml , and add the following contents: runtime : go126 # or another supported version This is the simplest configuration for an App Engine app.
- Deploy your web service on App Engine In your go-app directory where your app.yaml file is located, deploy your web service to App Engine using the following command: gcloud app deploy To launch your browser and view your web service at https:// PROJECT ID .
- To confirm service creation and version deployment: View your App Engine services in the Google Cloud console: View services You should see one service listed, named default .
- To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command: gcloud init Create your App Engine app and its associated resources.

- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- The following example demonstrates how to designate all png files as static files (except those in the data/ directory and all of its subdirectories): < static - files > < include path = "/ .png" / > < exclude path = "/data/ .png" / > < / static - files > You can also set HTTP headers to use when responding to requests to these static resources. < static - files > < include path = "/my static-files" > < http - header name = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value = "http://example.org" / > < / include > < / static - files > Note: If the path string doesn't start with a slash, then the HTTP headers, if any, work on App Engine but do not work on the Development Server.
- The appengine-web.xml file can define environment variables that are set when the application is running. <env-variables> <env-var name="DEFAULT ENCODING" value="UTF-8" /> </env-variables> To avoid conflicts with your local environment, the development server does not set environment variables based on this file, and requires that the local environment have these variables already set to matching values. export DEFAULT ENCODING = "UTF-8" dev appserver war When deployed to App Engine, the environment is created with these variables already set.
