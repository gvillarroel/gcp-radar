Evidence snippets:
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- App Engine Java applications use a configuration file, named appengine-web.xml , to specify information about your app and to identify which files in the app's WAR file are static files (like images) and which are resource files used by the application.
- If for some reason you prefer that your app not use precompilation, you can turn it off by adding the following to your appengine-web.xml file: <precompilation-enabled>false</precompilation-enabled> <module> Note: Modules are now named Services and services are still declared in appengine-web.xml files as modules, for example: <module>service name</module> .
- It's possible to reduce request latency by configuring your application to asynchronously write HTTP session data to the Datastore: <async-session-persistence enabled="true" /> With async session persistence turned on, App Engine will submit a Task Queue task to write session data to the Datastore before writing the data to memcache.

Evidence snippets:
- Create a new folder called go-app for your Go service: mkdir go-app In your go-app/ folder, create a file called app.yaml , and add the following contents: runtime : go126 # or another supported version This is the simplest configuration for an App Engine app.
- Deploy your web service on App Engine In your go-app directory where your app.yaml file is located, deploy your web service to App Engine using the following command: gcloud app deploy To launch your browser and view your web service at https:// PROJECT ID .
- Learn how to add other features to your application by exploring the following pages: Learn more about writing application logs and interpreting system logs in Reading and Writing Application Logs .
- To confirm service creation and version deployment: View your App Engine services in the Google Cloud console: View services You should see one service listed, named default .

Evidence snippets:
- The representation types for the supported Go property types are: "INT64": signed integers and time.Time "DOUBLE": float32 and float64 "BOOLEAN": bool "STRING": string, []byte and ByteString "POINT": appengine.GeoPoint "REFERENCE": Key "USER": (not used in the Go runtime) func Kinds func Kinds ( ctx context .
- Valid value types are: signed integers (int, int8, int16, int32 and int64), bool, string, float32 and float64, []byte (up to 1 megabyte in length), any type whose underlying type is one of the above predeclared types, ByteString, Key, time.Time (stored with microsecond precision), appengine.BlobKey, appengine.GeoPoint, structs whose fields are all valid value types, slices of any of the above.
- The valid types are: // - int64 // - bool // - string // - float64 // - ByteString // - Key // - time.Time // - appengine.BlobKey // - appengine.GeoPoint // - []byte (up to 1 megabyte in length) // - Entity (representing a nested struct) // This set is smaller than the set of valid struct field types that the // datastore can load and save.
- An empty kind means to return all entities, including entities created and managed by other App Engine features, and is called a kindless query.
