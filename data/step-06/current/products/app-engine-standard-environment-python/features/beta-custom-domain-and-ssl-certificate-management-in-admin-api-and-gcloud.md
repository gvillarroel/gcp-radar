- To read your Google Cloud project-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --project= PROJECT ID To read your folder-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : folders/ FOLDER ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --folder= FOLDER ID To read your organization-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --organization= ORGANIZATION ID To read your Cloud Billing account-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : billingAccounts/ BILLING ACCOUNT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --billing-account= BILLING ACCOUNT ID Add the --freshness flag to your command to read logs that are more than 1 day old.

Evidence snippets:
- To perform these steps, you must have one of the following roles on the host project: Owner role ( roles/owner ) Compute Security Admin role ( roles/compute.securityAdmin ) Custom Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the compute.firewalls.create permission enabled For a basic configuration, apply the rules to allow serverless resources in any service project connected to the Shared VPC network to send requests to any resource in the network.
- You must have one of the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles: Compute Security Admin role Custom IAM role with the compute.firewalls.create permission enabled Deny connector traffic across your VPC network.
- You must have one of the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles: Compute Security Admin role Custom IAM role with the compute.firewalls.create permission enabled Deny connector traffic across your VPC network.
- You must have one of the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles: Compute Security Admin role Custom IAM role with the compute.firewalls.create permission enabled Deny egress traffic from your connector.

Evidence snippets:
- When accessing internal services, call them as you would normally do by using their public URLs, either the default appspot.com URL or a custom domain set up in App Engine.
- At a network level, by default, any resource on the internet is able to reach your App Engine app on its appspot URL or at a custom domain set up in App Engine.
- Requests from other sources, including the internet, cannot reach your service at the appspot.com URL or custom domains.
- For example: To update the default service of an App Engine app to accept traffic only from Cloud Load Balancing and VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update default --ingress = internal-and-cloud-load-balancing To update a service named "internal-requests" to accept traffic only from VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update internal-requests --ingress = internal-only Egress settings Note: Egress settings are not available for the PHP runtimes.
