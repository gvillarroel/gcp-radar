Evidence snippets:
- For example: To update the default service of an App Engine app to accept traffic only from Cloud Load Balancing and VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update default --ingress = internal-and-cloud-load-balancing To update a service named "internal-requests" to accept traffic only from VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update internal-requests --ingress = internal-only Egress settings Note: Egress settings are not available for the PHP runtimes.
- For each service, the value in this column shows the ingress setting as one of All (default), Internal + Load Balancing , or Internal . gcloud To view the ingress setting for a service using the gcloud CLI: gcloud app services describe SERVICE Replace SERVICE with the name of your service.
- OK This section describes how to use ingress settings to restrict network access to your App Engine app.
- Internal and Cloud Load Balancing Allows requests from the following resources: Resources allowed by the more restrictive Internal setting External Application Load Balancer Use the Internal and Cloud Load Balancing setting to accept requests from an external Application Load Balancer but not directly from the internet.

Evidence snippets:
- For example, you can create a dispatch file to route mobile requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/mobile/ to a mobile frontend, and route worker requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/work/ to a static backend: dispatch: Send all mobile traffic to the mobile frontend. - url: " /mobile/ " service: mobile-frontend Send all work to the one static backend. - url: " /work/ " service: static-backend Deploying the dispatch file To deploy the dispatch file using gcloud, run the following command: gcloud app deploy dispatch.yaml Routing with Cloud Load Balancing Cloud Load Balancing is a separate product that enables advanced network configurations for all of your applications running on Google Cloud.
- Note the following: We recommend that you use ingress controls so that your app only receives requests sent from the load balancer (and the VPC if you use it).
- Requests that don't pass through Cloud Load Balancing are never intercepted and rerouted by the patterns that you have defined in your dispatch file: Sends the request to an available instance of a specific service and version: https:// VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT ID .
- When HTTP(S) Load Balancing is enabled for serverless apps , you can: Configure your serverless app to serve from a dedicated IPv4 or IPv6 IP address that is not shared with other services.

Evidence snippets:
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- Test the custom constraint To test the example that restricts ingress settings, deploy a connector in the project with network set to default : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create org-policy-test \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION ID \ --network = default The output is the following: Operation denied by custom org policies: ["customConstraints/custom.defaultNetworkConstraint": "Require network to not be set to default."] Example custom organization policies for common use cases The following table provides examples of custom constraints that you might find useful with Serverless VPC Access connectors: Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors can only use a specific network. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.allowlistNetworks resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.network == 'allowlisted-network'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : allowlistNetworks description : Require connectors to use a specific network.
- Don't change the specified ports. gcloud compute firewall-rules create serverless-to-vpc-connector \ --allow tcp:667,udp:665-666,icmp \ --source-ranges = 35 .199.224.0/19 \ --direction = INGRESS \ --target-tags vpc-connector \ --network = VPC NETWORK gcloud compute firewall-rules create vpc-connector-to-serverless \ --allow tcp:667,udp:665-666,icmp \ --destination-ranges = 35 .199.224.0/19 \ --direction = EGRESS \ --target-tags vpc-connector \ --network = VPC NETWORK gcloud compute firewall-rules create vpc-connector-health-checks \ --allow tcp:667 \ --source-ranges = 35 .191.0.0/16,35.191.192.0/18,130.211.0.0/22 \ --direction = INGRESS \ --target-tags vpc-connector \ --network = VPC NETWORK Replace VPC NETWORK with the name of the VPC network to attach your connector to.
- Create a connector using an existing subnet : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create CONNECTOR NAME \ --region REGION \ --subnet SUBNET NAME \ --subnet-project HOST PROJECT ID \ --min-instances MIN \ --max-instances MAX \ --machine-type MACHINE TYPE Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : a name for your connector, matching Compute Engine naming conventions , with the additional requirements that the name must be less than 21 characters long, and that hyphens (-) count as two characters.
