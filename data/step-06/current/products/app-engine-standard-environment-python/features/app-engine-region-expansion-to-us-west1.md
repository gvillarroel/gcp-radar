Evidence snippets:
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Authenticating users Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Provides authentication by adding an Identity and Access Management (IAM) verification layer above your App Engine app.
- The Users API allows an App Engine app to perform the following tasks: Detect whether the current user is signed in using a Google Account.
- IAP doesn't protect against activity within a project, such as one App Engine service accessing another service in the same project.

Evidence snippets:
- REGION ID .r.appspot.com To target specific resources in your App Engine app, use the -dot- syntax to separate each resource you want to target, for example: https:// VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT ID .
- For apps created after February 2020, REGION ID .r is included in App Engine URLs.
- Block abusive IP addresses While Google Cloud has many mechanisms in place to prevent attacks, you can use the App Engine firewall to block traffic to your app from IP addresses that present malicious intent or shield your app from denial of service attacks and similar forms of abuse.
- Security scanner The Google Cloud Web Security Scanner discovers vulnerabilities by crawling your App Engine app, following all that links within the scope of your starting URLs, and attempting to exercise as many user inputs and event handlers as possible.

Evidence snippets:
- When you create your App Engine app, all your resources are created in the region that you choose, including your app code along with a collection of settings, credentials, and your app's metadata.
- For apps created after February 2020, REGION ID .r is included in App Engine URLs.
- For example, an app that handles your customer requests might include separate services that each handle different tasks, such as: API requests from mobile devices Internal, administration-type requests Backend processing such as billing pipelines and data analysis Each service in App Engine consists of the source code from your app and the corresponding App Engine configuration files.
- In this diagram, the app has two services that contain multiple versions, and two of those versions are actively running on multiple instances: Other Google Cloud services, for example Datastore, are shared across your App Engine app.
