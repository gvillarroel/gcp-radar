Evidence snippets:
- Deploy your web service on App Engine In your go-app directory where your app.yaml file is located, deploy your web service to App Engine using the following command: gcloud app deploy To launch your browser and view your web service at https:// PROJECT ID .
- You must choose a location, which cannot be changed later. gcloud app create Learn more : Generally, select the region nearest to your app's users, but also consider the location of the other Google Cloud products and services that your app uses.
- The code does not correspond to a country or province, even though some region IDs may appear similar to commonly used country and province codes.
- You just set up and deployed your web application to App Engine.

Evidence snippets:
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- The following example demonstrates how to designate all png files as static files (except those in the data/ directory and all of its subdirectories): < static - files > < include path = "/ .png" / > < exclude path = "/data/ .png" / > < / static - files > You can also set HTTP headers to use when responding to requests to these static resources. < static - files > < include path = "/my static-files" > < http - header name = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value = "http://example.org" / > < / include > < / static - files > Note: If the path string doesn't start with a slash, then the HTTP headers, if any, work on App Engine but do not work on the Development Server.
- To serve custom error pages, add a <static-error-handlers> section to your appengine-web.xml , as ins this example: <static-error-handlers> <handler file="default error.html" /> <handler file="over quota.html" error-code="over quota" /> </static-error-handlers> Warning : Make sure that the path to the error response file does not overlap with static file handler paths.
- If for some reason you prefer that your app not use precompilation, you can turn it off by adding the following to your appengine-web.xml file: <precompilation-enabled>false</precompilation-enabled> <module> Note: Modules are now named Services and services are still declared in appengine-web.xml files as modules, for example: <module>service name</module> .

Evidence snippets:
- When a namespace aware class (e.g., com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Key , com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Query and com.google.appengine.api.memcache.MemcacheService ) is constructed, it determines which namespace will be used by calling NamespaceManager#get() if it is otherwise unspecified.
- The Task Queue com.google.appengine.api.taskqueue.Queue#add methods will forward the NamespaceManager settings into the task being added causing the added task to be executed with the same current namespace as the task creator.
- Classes LifecycleManager NamespaceManager Provides functions for manipulating the current namespace used for App Engine APIs.
- ThreadManager ThreadManager exposes a ThreadFactory that allows App Engine applications to spawn new threads.
