Evidence snippets:
- When a namespace aware class (e.g., com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Key , com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Query and com.google.appengine.api.memcache.MemcacheService ) is constructed, it determines which namespace will be used by calling NamespaceManager#get() if it is otherwise unspecified.
