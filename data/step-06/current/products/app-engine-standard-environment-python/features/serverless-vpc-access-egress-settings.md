# Serverless VPC Access egress settings

Product: App Engine standard environment Python
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

Adds generally available egress configuration options for Serverless VPC Access traffic; Introduces egress settings that control whether outbound external traffic uses a Serverless VPC Access connector.

## Extended Definition

Adds generally available egress configuration options for Serverless VPC Access traffic; Introduces egress settings that control whether outbound external traffic uses a Serverless VPC Access connector.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

Evidence snippets:
- Using the urlfetch library ignores egress settings, and requests will not route through a Serverless VPC Access connector.
- Test the custom constraint To test the example that restricts ingress settings, deploy a connector in the project with network set to default : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create org-policy-test \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION ID \ --network = default The output is the following: Operation denied by custom org policies: ["customConstraints/custom.defaultNetworkConstraint": "Require network to not be set to default."] Example custom organization policies for common use cases The following table provides examples of custom constraints that you might find useful with Serverless VPC Access connectors: Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors can only use a specific network. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.allowlistNetworks resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.network == 'allowlisted-network'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : allowlistNetworks description : Require connectors to use a specific network.
- Create an egress firewall rule on your Serverless VPC Access connector to prevent it from sending outgoing traffic, with the exception of established responses, to any destination. gcloud compute firewall-rules create RULE NAME \ --action = DENY \ --rules = PROTOCOL \ --direction = EGRESS \ --target-tags = VPC CONNECTOR NETWORK TAG \ --network = VPC NETWORK \ --priority = PRIORITY Replace the following: RULE NAME : the name of your new firewall rule.
- Manage your connector Controlling egress traffic from a service By default, only requests to internal IP addresses and internal DNS names are routed through a Serverless VPC Access connector.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Using the urlfetch library ignores egress settings, and requests will not route through a Serverless VPC Access connector.
- For example: To update the default service of an App Engine app to accept traffic only from Cloud Load Balancing and VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update default --ingress = internal-and-cloud-load-balancing To update a service named "internal-requests" to accept traffic only from VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update internal-requests --ingress = internal-only Egress settings Note: Egress settings are not available for the PHP runtimes.
- Note that routing all outbound requests to your VPC network increases the amount of egress handled by the Serverless VPC Access connector and can incur charges .
- If you use Serverless VPC Access , you can specify the egress setting for your App Engine service.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- With Egress control settings, you can require all traffic from your App Engine services to be routed through the attached VPC Connector.
- Egress controls Egress controls determine what traffic is sent over Serverless VPC connectors .
- To modify the default settings, and edit and view the available settings, see Specify ingress settings .
- By default, only requests to private IP addresses are routed through a Serverless VPC connector.
