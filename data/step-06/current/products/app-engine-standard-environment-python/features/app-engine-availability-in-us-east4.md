Evidence snippets:
- Service name App Engine audit logs use the service name appengine.googleapis.com .
- Audited operations The following table summarizes which API operations correspond to each audit log type in App Engine: Audit logs category App Engine operations Admin Activity audit logs apps.create apps.patch apps.repair apps.authorizedCertificates.create apps.authorizedCertificates.delete apps.authorizedCertificates.patch apps.domainMappings.create apps.domainMappings.delete apps.domainMappings.patch apps.firewall.ingressRules.batchUpdate apps.firewall.ingressRules.create apps.firewall.ingressRules.delete apps.firewall.ingressRules.patch apps.services.delete apps.services.patch apps.services.versions.create apps.services.versions.delete apps.services.versions.patch apps.services.versions.instances.debug apps.services.versions.instances.delete Data Access audit logs GetMemcacheItem SetMemcacheItem DeleteMemcacheItem FlushAllMemcacheItems Memcache audit logs only apply to operations made through Cloud Console.
- When deciding which Logging-specific permissions and roles apply to your use case, consider the following: The Logs Viewer role ( roles/logging.viewer ) gives you read-only access to Admin Activity, Policy Denied, and System Event audit logs.
- Available audit logs The following types of audit logs are available for App Engine: Admin Activity audit logs Includes "admin write" operations that write metadata or configuration information.

Evidence snippets:
- Deploy your web service on App Engine In your go-app directory where your app.yaml file is located, deploy your web service to App Engine using the following command: gcloud app deploy To launch your browser and view your web service at https:// PROJECT ID .
- Create a new folder called go-app for your Go service: mkdir go-app In your go-app/ folder, create a file called app.yaml , and add the following contents: runtime : go126 # or another supported version This is the simplest configuration for an App Engine app.
- To confirm service creation and version deployment: View your App Engine services in the Google Cloud console: View services You should see one service listed, named default .
- When your app is running on App Engine, the PORT environment variable is set for you, but when testing your app locally, you can set PORT to any preferred value.

Evidence snippets:
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- To serve custom error pages, add a <static-error-handlers> section to your appengine-web.xml , as ins this example: <static-error-handlers> <handler file="default error.html" /> <handler file="over quota.html" error-code="over quota" /> </static-error-handlers> Warning : Make sure that the path to the error response file does not overlap with static file handler paths.
- To determine how long a connection remains inactive without any data transmission before the client closes it, configure an idle timeout using the following syntax: <env-variables> <env-var name="APPENGINE API CALLS IDLE TIMEOUT MS" value="TIMEOUT IN MS" /> </env-variables> Replace TIMEOUT IN MS with the required timeout in milliseconds.
- It's possible to reduce request latency by configuring your application to asynchronously write HTTP session data to the Datastore: <async-session-persistence enabled="true" /> With async session persistence turned on, App Engine will submit a Task Queue task to write session data to the Datastore before writing the data to memcache.
