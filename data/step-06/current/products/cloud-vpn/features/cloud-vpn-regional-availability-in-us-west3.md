Evidence snippets:
- HA VPN to one peer (on-premises) VPN gateway with one IP address (click to enlarge) Configure for 99.99% availability SLA To meet the 99.99% availability SLA on the Google Cloud side, there must be a tunnel from each of the two interfaces on the HA VPN gateway to the corresponding interfaces on the peer gateway.
- Configuring only one tunnel from a single HA VPN interface to a single interface on the peer gateway doesn't provide enough redundancy to meet the availability SLA because there is an unused interface on the HA VPN gateway, which does not have a tunnel configured on it.
- 99.99% HA VPN to Compute Engine VM instances in multiple zones Connect an HA VPN gateway to Compute Engine VM instances with external IP addresses 99.9% HA VPN to a single Compute Engine VM instance Connect an HA VPN gateway to only one Compute Engine VM instance with an external IP address The availability SLA is determined by the availability SLA provided for a single VM instance of memory-optimized machine family for Compute Engine.
- High availability configurations for HA VPN The following table outlines the availability SLAs offered by different HA VPN configurations: Topology Description Availability SLA Connect Google Cloud to your peer VPN gateway Connect an HA VPN gateway to one or two separate peer VPN gateways 99.99% Connect VPC networks by using HA VPN gateways Connect two Google Cloud VPC networks by using an HA VPN gateway in each network.

- Cloud VPN Google Cloud Page Contents Cloud VPN pricing At a high level, your Cloud VPN charges consist of the following: An hourly charge for each Cloud VPN gateway; this charge is determined partly by the number of tunnels attached to the gateway, as well as the location of the gateway A monthly charge for IPsec traffic An hourly charge for any external IP address assigned to a VPN gateway but not used by a tunnel For more information about Cloud VPN, see the Cloud VPN overview.
- HA VPN only: For 99.99% availability, you must configure two tunnels, or, if working with an AWS peer gateway, four tunnels. $0.05 / 1 hour IPsec traffic You are charged as follows: If the Cloud VPN tunnel connects to another Cloud VPN gateway, you are charged data transfer pricing as described in VM-VM data transfer pricing within Google Cloud .
- No charge for a reserved external IP address that is used by a tunnel. $297.28 asia-northeast1 gateway to data center and another VPC network Suppose your project has a VPC network called Network A, which includes a VPN gateway in asia-northeast1.
