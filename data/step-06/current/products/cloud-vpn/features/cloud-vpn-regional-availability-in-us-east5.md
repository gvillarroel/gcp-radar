- In the following commands, replace the following: GOOGLE BGP IPV4 0 : the IPv4 address of the Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on Cloud VPN gateway interface 0 ; PEER BGP IPV4 0 represents the IPv4 address of its BGP peer, matches with GOOGLE BGP IPV4 0 GOOGLE BGP IPV6 0 : the IPv6 address of the Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on Cloud VPN gateway interface 0 ; PEER BGP IPV6 0 represents the IPv6 address of its BGP peer, matches with GOOGLE BGP IPV6 0 GOOGLE BGP IPV4 1 : the IPv4 address of the Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on Cloud VPN gateway interface 1 ; PEER BGP IPV4 1 represents the IPv4 address of its BGP peer, matches with GOOGLE BGP IPV4 1 GOOGLE BGP IPV6 1 : the IPv6 address of the Cloud Router's interface for the tunnel on Cloud VPN gateway interface 1 ; PEER BGP IPV6 1 represents the IPv6 address of its BGP peer, matches with GOOGLE BGP IPV6 1 For the first VPN tunnel Add an interface with an IPv4 address to the Cloud Router; replace ROUTER INTERFACE NAME 0 ipv4 with a name for the interface: gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER NAME \ --interface-name= ROUTER INTERFACE NAME 0 ipv4 \ --vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL NAME 0 \ --ip-address= GOOGLE BGP IPV4 0 \ --mask-length 30 \ --region= REGION The command output looks similar to the following example: Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/us-central1/routers/router-a].
- For the second VPN tunnel Add a second interface to the Cloud Router. gcloud compute routers add-interface ROUTER NAME \ --interface-name= ROUTER INTERFACE NAME 1 \ --vpn-tunnel= TUNNEL NAME 1 \ --region= REGION \ --ip-version=IPV6 Add a BGP peer configuration to the interface for the second tunnel . gcloud compute routers add-bgp-peer ROUTER NAME \ --peer-name= PEER NAME 1 \ --peer-asn= PEER ASN \ --interface= ROUTER INTERFACE NAME 1 \ --region= REGION \ --enable-ipv4 \ --ipv4-nexthop-address= IPV4 NEXTHOP ADDRESS \ --peer-ipv4-nexthop-address= PEER IPV4 NEXTHOP ADDRESS In the following commands, replace the following: PEER NAME 1 with a name for the peer VPN interface PEER ASN with the ASN configured for the peer VPN gateway IPV4 NEXTHOP ADDRESS : the next hop address for IPv4 routes that are advertised by Cloud Router; the address must be in the 169.254.0.0/16 IPv4 address range PEER IPV4 NEXTHOP ADDRESS : the next hop address for IPv4 routes that are learned by Cloud Router from the BGP peer; the address must be in the 169.254.0.0/16 IPv4 address range API To create BGP sessions, follow these steps: To create a Cloud Router interface and assign it an IPv6 address, make either a PATCH or UPDATE request by using the routers.patch method or the routers.update method .
- Note: The VPN tunnels that you create aren't available until the corresponding partner tunnels have been created on your peer VPN gateway or gateways. gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create TUNNEL NAME IF0 \ --peer-external-gateway= PEER GW NAME \ --peer-external-gateway-interface= PEER EXT GW IF0 \ --region= REGION \ --ike-version= IKE VERS \ --shared-secret= SHARED SECRET \ --router= ROUTER NAME \ --vpn-gateway= GW NAME \ [--vpn-gateway-region= VPN GATEWAY REGION ] \ --interface= INT NUM 0 gcloud compute vpn-tunnels create TUNNEL NAME IF1 \ --peer-external-gateway= PEER GW NAME \ --peer-external-gateway-interface= PEER EXT GW IF1 \ --region= REGION \ --ike-version= IKE VERS \ --shared-secret= SHARED SECRET \ --router= ROUTER NAME \ --vpn-gateway= GW NAME \ [--vpn-gateway-region= VPN GATEWAY REGION ] \ --interface= INT NUM 1 Replace the following: TUNNEL NAME IF0 and TUNNEL NAME IF1 : a name for the tunnel; naming the tunnels by including the gateway interface name can help identify the tunnels later PEER GW NAME : a name of the external peer gateway created earlier PEER EXT GW IF0 and PEER EXT GW IF1 : the interface number configured earlier on the external peer gateway IKE VERS : 1 for IKEv1 or 2 for IKEv2; if possible, use IKEv2 for the IKE version.

Evidence snippets:
- HA VPN to one peer (on-premises) VPN gateway with one IP address (click to enlarge) Configure for 99.99% availability SLA To meet the 99.99% availability SLA on the Google Cloud side, there must be a tunnel from each of the two interfaces on the HA VPN gateway to the corresponding interfaces on the peer gateway.
- Configuring only one tunnel from a single HA VPN interface to a single interface on the peer gateway doesn't provide enough redundancy to meet the availability SLA because there is an unused interface on the HA VPN gateway, which does not have a tunnel configured on it.
- 99.99% HA VPN to Compute Engine VM instances in multiple zones Connect an HA VPN gateway to Compute Engine VM instances with external IP addresses 99.9% HA VPN to a single Compute Engine VM instance Connect an HA VPN gateway to only one Compute Engine VM instance with an external IP address The availability SLA is determined by the availability SLA provided for a single VM instance of memory-optimized machine family for Compute Engine.
- High availability configurations for HA VPN The following table outlines the availability SLAs offered by different HA VPN configurations: Topology Description Availability SLA Connect Google Cloud to your peer VPN gateway Connect an HA VPN gateway to one or two separate peer VPN gateways 99.99% Connect VPC networks by using HA VPN gateways Connect two Google Cloud VPC networks by using an HA VPN gateway in each network.
