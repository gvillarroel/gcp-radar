Evidence snippets:
- The following Cloud VPN traffic remains within the Google Cloud network: Between two HA VPN gateways Between two Classic VPN gateways Between a Classic VPN or HA VPN gateway and the external IP address of a Compute Engine VM acting as a VPN gateway Cloud VPN can be used with Private Google Access for on-premises hosts .
- Two tunnels from one Cloud VPN gateway to the same peer gateway Supported Not supported Connect a Cloud VPN gateway to Compute Engine VMs with external IP addresses.
- Stack type Supported gateway external IP addresses IPV4 ONLY IPv4 IPV4 IPV6 IPv4, IPv6 IPV6 ONLY IPv6 Organization policy constraints for IPv6 You can disable the creation of all IPv6 hybrid resources in your project by setting the following organization policy to true: constraints/compute.disableHybridCloudIpv6 For HA VPN, this organization policy constraint prevents the creation of any dual-stack HA VPN gateways and IPv6-only HA VPN gateways in the project.
- Visualizing and monitoring Cloud VPN connections Network Topology is a visualization tool that shows the topology of your VPC networks, hybrid connectivity to and from your on-premises networks, and the associated metrics.
