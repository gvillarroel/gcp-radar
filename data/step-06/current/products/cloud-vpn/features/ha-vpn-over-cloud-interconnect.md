Evidence snippets:
- With HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect, you get the security of IPsec encryption from Cloud VPN alongside the increased capacity of Cloud Interconnect.
- Stack type Supported gateway external IP addresses IPV4 ONLY IPv4 IPV4 IPV6 IPv4, IPv6 IPV6 ONLY IPv6 Organization policy constraints for IPv6 You can disable the creation of all IPv6 hybrid resources in your project by setting the following organization policy to true: constraints/compute.disableHybridCloudIpv6 For HA VPN, this organization policy constraint prevents the creation of any dual-stack HA VPN gateways and IPv6-only HA VPN gateways in the project.
- The following Cloud VPN traffic remains within the Google Cloud network: Between two HA VPN gateways Between two Classic VPN gateways Between a Classic VPN or HA VPN gateway and the external IP address of a Compute Engine VM acting as a VPN gateway Cloud VPN can be used with Private Google Access for on-premises hosts .
- You must configure ciphers from the supported list of ciphers that meet the following criteria: If you specify AEAD ciphers for encryption, you cannot specify separate ciphers for integrity because Cloud VPN uses the same encryption ciphers for handling integrity.

### HA VPN topologies \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Final score: 192
- Re-rank relevance: WEAK
- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- In this topology, you create HA VPN tunnels to carry IPsec-encrypted traffic over VLAN attachments of either Dedicated Interconnect or Partner Interconnect.
- You can connect two VPC networks together by using an HA VPN gateway in each network, where the HA VPN gateways are in different regions.
- If you deploy an HA VPN gateway with IPV6 ONLY or IPV4 IPV6 stack type, then your VPN tunnels can support the exchange of IPv6 traffic.
- Connect VPC networks by using HA VPN gateways You can connect two Google Cloud VPC networks by using an HA VPN gateway in each network.
