- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- App Engine uses a "precompilation" process with the Java bytecode of an app to enhance the performance of the app in the Java runtime environment.
- If your application interacts with Datastore or Task Queues operations, set up monitoring to monitor performance and behavior impacts after enabling this feature. <system-properties> <property name="appengine.use.httpconnector" value="true"/> </system-properties> Optional.
- Overrides the default entrypoint which is the process command line that boots the Java application.

- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Run the following command to test your rule and ensure that the priority and action provide the expected behavior: gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip IP ADDRESS where IP ADDRESS is the IP address that you want to test against your firewall.
- Examples: Use the following examples to help you create your firewall: Add a rule that allows an IPv6 address and subnet mask, and then test that rule to ensure it gets evaluated prior to your other rules: gcloud app firewall-rules create 123 --source-range fe80::3636:3bff:fecc:8778/128 --action allow gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip fe80::3636:3bff:fecc:8778 Add a rule to deny an IPv4 address and subnet mask, and then test that rule to ensure that it gets appropriately evaluated: gcloud app firewall-rules create 123456 --source-range "74.125.0.0/16" --action deny gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip 74 .125.0.8 Update and then test the default rule to ensure that it restricts all IP addresses that don't match any other rules: gcloud app firewall-rules update default --action deny gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip 123 .456.7.89 API To programmatically create firewall rules for your App Engine app, you can use the apps.firewall.ingressRules methods in the Admin API.
- Enter the IP address that you want to validate and then click Test to ensure that the corresponding rule gets correctly evaluated. gcloud Run the following gcloud app firewall-rules commands to create a firewall rule: Run the following command to create a firewall rule: gcloud app firewall-rules create PRIORITY --action ALLOW OR DENY --source-range IP RANGE --description DESCRIPTION where: PRIORITY is an integer between 1 and 2147483646 that defines the rule's importance and order for which the rule is evaluated.
- Before you begin Before you can create App Engine firewall rules for your app, you must have one of the following App Engine IAM roles , which include the necessary privileges for creating or modifying firewall rules: App Engine Admin Editor Owner Creating firewall rules Use one of the following methods to create a firewall rule.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- Create a connector using an existing subnet : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create CONNECTOR NAME \ --region REGION \ --subnet SUBNET NAME \ --subnet-project HOST PROJECT ID \ --min-instances MIN \ --max-instances MAX \ --machine-type MACHINE TYPE Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : a name for your connector, matching Compute Engine naming conventions , with the additional requirements that the name must be less than 21 characters long, and that hyphens (-) count as two characters.
- However, if you create a connector in a service project and the connector targets a Shared VPC network in the host project, you must add firewall rules to allow necessary traffic for the connector's operation from the following ranges: Serverless infrastructure IP range : 35.199.224.0/19 Health check probe IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 , 35.191.192.0/18 , and 130.211.0.0/22 These ranges are used by the Google infrastructure underlying Cloud Run, Cloud Run functions, and App Engine standard environment.
