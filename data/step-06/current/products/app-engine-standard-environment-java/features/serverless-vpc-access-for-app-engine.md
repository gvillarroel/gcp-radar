Evidence snippets:
- Route the traffic over a Serverless VPC Access connector : For each App Engine version sending private traffic to other app endpoints, attach the version to a Serverless VPC Access connector belonging to one of the Google Cloud project's own networks, not a Shared VPC network.
- Configure the client app to send all-traffic through the Serverless VPC Access connector, instead of configuring requests to use the private.googleapis.com IP range.
- In the standard environment, attach each client version to a Serverless VPC Access connector on the Shared VPC network.
- Other methods of communication between projects using internal access are not possible in App Engine.

Evidence snippets:
- Note that the scheduler might spawn a new instance before the actual maximum number of requests is reached. max pending latency The maximum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting additional instances to handle requests so that pending latency is reduced.
- Specify the fully-qualified name of your Serverless VPC Access connector in quotes: "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME " egress setting Optional.
- Requests to external IP addresses are sent to the public internet. all-traffic All requests are sent through the Serverless VPC Access connector into the connected VPC network.
- CORS Support One important use of this feature is to support cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), such as accessing files hosted by another App Engine app.
