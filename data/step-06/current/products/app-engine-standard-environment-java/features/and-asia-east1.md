Evidence snippets:
- Example The following is an example of an app.yaml file: runtime : python314 instance class : F2 env variables : BUCKET NAME : "example-gcs-bucket" handlers : Matches requests to /images/... to files in static/images/... - url : /images static dir : static/images - url : /. secure : always redirect http response code : 301 script : auto The following table provides YAML examples of available fields in an app.yaml file: Runtime and app elements Element Description app engine apis Optional.
- A high maximum means users might wait longer for their requests to be served (if there are pending requests and no idle instances to serve them), but your application will cost less to run. min pending latency An optional element you can set to specify the minimum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting a new instance to handle it.
- Note that the scheduler might spawn a new instance before the actual maximum number of requests is reached. max pending latency The maximum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting additional instances to handle requests so that pending latency is reduced.
- The following values are available depending on your service's scaling : Automatic scaling F1 , F2 , F4 , F4 1G Default: F1 Optionally use the automatic scaling element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as minimum and maximum number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections.
