Evidence snippets:
- REGION ID .r.appspot.com To target specific resources in your App Engine app, use the -dot- syntax to separate each resource you want to target, for example: https:// VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT ID .
- For apps created after February 2020, REGION ID .r is included in App Engine URLs.
- Block abusive IP addresses While Google Cloud has many mechanisms in place to prevent attacks, you can use the App Engine firewall to block traffic to your app from IP addresses that present malicious intent or shield your app from denial of service attacks and similar forms of abuse.
- Security scanner The Google Cloud Web Security Scanner discovers vulnerabilities by crawling your App Engine app, following all that links within the scope of your starting URLs, and attempting to exercise as many user inputs and event handlers as possible.

Evidence snippets:
- Example The following is an example of an app.yaml file: runtime : python314 instance class : F2 env variables : BUCKET NAME : "example-gcs-bucket" handlers : Matches requests to /images/... to files in static/images/... - url : /images static dir : static/images - url : /. secure : always redirect http response code : 301 script : auto The following table provides YAML examples of available fields in an app.yaml file: Runtime and app elements Element Description app engine apis Optional.
- For apps created after February 2020, REGION ID .r is included in App Engine URLs.
- A high maximum means users might wait longer for their requests to be served (if there are pending requests and no idle instances to serve them), but your application will cost less to run. min pending latency An optional element you can set to specify the minimum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting a new instance to handle it.
- Python example handlers : - url : /youraccount/. secure : always script : auto To target a specific version of your app using the REGION ID .r.appspot.com domain, you replace the periods that would usually separate the subdomain components of the URL with the string " -dot- ", for example: https:// VERSION ID -dot-default-dot- PROJECT ID .
