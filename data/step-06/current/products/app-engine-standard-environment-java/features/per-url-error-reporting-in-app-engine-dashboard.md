Evidence snippets:
- In the Go API, the appengine.IsOverQuota function reports whether an error represents an API call failure due to insufficient available quota.
- The following example illustrates how to catch the OverQuotaError , which may be raised by the SendMessage() method if an email-related quota has been exceeded: try: mail.SendMessage ( to = 'test@example.com' , from = 'admin@example.com' , subject = 'Test Email' , body = 'Testing' ) except apiproxy errors.OverQuotaError, message: Log the error. logging.error(message) Display an informative message to the user. self.response.out.write ( 'The email could not be sent. ' 'Please try again later.' ) Is your app exceeding the default limits?
- For resources that are required to initiate a request, when the resource is depleted, App Engine by default returns an HTTP 403 or 503 error code for the request instead of calling a request handler.
- Note: To view an application's quota consumption on the IAM Quotas page, ensure that the App Engine Reporting Service is enabled for the project.
