# Cloud Load Balancing network ingress controls for App Engine

Product: App Engine standard environment Java
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

App Engine can restrict inbound traffic so apps only accept requests that pass through Cloud Load Balancing.

- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- For example: To update the default service of an App Engine app to accept traffic only from Cloud Load Balancing and VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update default --ingress = internal-and-cloud-load-balancing To update a service named "internal-requests" to accept traffic only from VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update internal-requests --ingress = internal-only Egress settings Note: Egress settings are not available for the PHP runtimes.
- For each service, the value in this column shows the ingress setting as one of All (default), Internal + Load Balancing , or Internal . gcloud To view the ingress setting for a service using the gcloud CLI: gcloud app services describe SERVICE Replace SERVICE with the name of your service.
- OK This section describes how to use ingress settings to restrict network access to your App Engine app.
- Internal and Cloud Load Balancing Allows requests from the following resources: Resources allowed by the more restrictive Internal setting External Application Load Balancer Use the Internal and Cloud Load Balancing setting to accept requests from an external Application Load Balancer but not directly from the internet.

Evidence snippets:
- For example, you can create a dispatch file to route mobile requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/mobile/ to a mobile frontend, and route worker requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/work/ to a static backend: dispatch: Send all mobile traffic to the mobile frontend. - url: " /mobile/ " service: mobile-frontend Send all work to the one static backend. - url: " /work/ " service: static-backend Deploying the dispatch file To deploy the dispatch file using gcloud, run the following command: gcloud app deploy dispatch.yaml Routing with Cloud Load Balancing Cloud Load Balancing is a separate product that enables advanced network configurations for all of your applications running on Google Cloud.
- Note the following: We recommend that you use ingress controls so that your app only receives requests sent from the load balancer (and the VPC if you use it).
- Requests that don't pass through Cloud Load Balancing are never intercepted and rerouted by the patterns that you have defined in your dispatch file: Sends the request to an available instance of a specific service and version: https:// VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT ID .
- When HTTP(S) Load Balancing is enabled for serverless apps , you can: Configure your serverless app to serve from a dedicated IPv4 or IPv6 IP address that is not shared with other services.

Evidence snippets:
- To confirm that your subnet is not used for Private Service Connect or Cloud Load Balancing, check that the subnet purpose is PRIVATE by running the following command in the gcloud CLI: gcloud compute networks subnets describe SUBNET NAME Replace SUBNET NAME with the name of your subnet. (Optional) To set scaling options for additional control over the connector, click Show Scaling Settings to display the scaling form.
- To confirm that your subnet is not used for Private Service Connect or Cloud Load Balancing, check that the subnet purpose is PRIVATE by running the following command in the gcloud CLI: gcloud compute networks subnets describe SUBNET NAME Replace the following: SUBNET NAME : the name of your subnet HOST PROJECT ID : the ID of the host project MIN : the minimum number of instances to use for the connector.
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Provide access to the connector Provide access to the connector by granting the Serverless VPC Access User IAM role on the host project to the principal that deploys your App Engine service.
- Click Save . gcloud Run the following in your terminal: gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding SERVICE PROJECT ID \ --member= PRINCIPAL \ --role=roles/compute.networkViewer Replace the following: SERVICE PROJECT ID : the ID of the service project PRINCIPAL : the principal who deploys App Engine services.
