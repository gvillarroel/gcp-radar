# Push queue Content-Length header for empty payloads

Product: App Engine standard environment Java
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Push queue requests for tasks with no payload include a Content-Length header set to 0.

## Extended Definition

Push queue requests for tasks with no payload include a Content-Length header set to 0.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

Evidence snippets:
- All subsequent requests for this URL that contain the Accept-Encoding: gzip header will receive the gzipped data from the cache until the cache becomes invalidated (due to the content changing after the cache expires).
- The following response headers that you can set in app.yaml influence how and when the Google Front End caches content: Cache-Control should be set to public for the Google Front End to cache content; it may also be cached by the Google Front End unless you specify a Cache-Control private or no-store directive.
- App Engine pending queue prioritization During periods of heavy traffic, App Engine might place requests in a pending queue while waiting for an available instance with the following prioritization: App Engine prioritizes other queued requests over pending queued requests from Task queue .
- For example: Strict-Transport-Security : max-age = 31536000 ; includeSubDomains To set this header for any static content that is served by your app, add the header to your app's static file and directory handlers .

Evidence snippets:
- The following example demonstrates how to designate all png files as static files (except those in the data/ directory and all of its subdirectories): < static - files > < include path = "/ .png" / > < exclude path = "/data/ .png" / > < / static - files > You can also set HTTP headers to use when responding to requests to these static resources. < static - files > < include path = "/my static-files" > < http - header name = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value = "http://example.org" / > < / include > < / static - files > Note: If the path string doesn't start with a slash, then the HTTP headers, if any, work on App Engine but do not work on the Development Server.
- However, you won't be charged for more instances than the maximum number you've specified. <max-pending-latency> The maximum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting additional instances to handle requests so that pending latency is reduced.
- Because App Engine keeps idle instances in reserve, it is unlikely that requests will enter the pending queue except in exceptionally high load spikes.
- A low minimum means requests must spend less time in the pending queue when all existing instances are active.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- A high maximum means users might wait longer for their requests to be served (if there are pending requests and no idle instances to serve them), but your application will cost less to run. min pending latency An optional element you can set to specify the minimum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting a new instance to handle it.
- Note that the scheduler might spawn a new instance before the actual maximum number of requests is reached. max pending latency The maximum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting additional instances to handle requests so that pending latency is reduced.
- This means requests can remain in the pending queue for up to 10s, the maximum pending request time limit , before new instance starts are triggered.
- If pending requests are in the queue: Less than the min pending latency you specify, App Engine will not create new instances.
