# Cross-group transaction version consistency

Product: App Engine standard environment Java
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Cross-group Datastore transactions assign the same version number to all new or updated entities in the transaction.

## Extended Definition

Cross-group Datastore transactions assign the same version number to all new or updated entities in the transaction.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

Evidence snippets:
- To adjust this level of consistency, set the datastore.default high rep job policy unapplied job pct system property with a value corresponding to the amount of eventual consistency you want your application to see. -Ddatastore.default high rep job policy unapplied job pct=20 If you are setting this property using the command prompt java dev appserver.sh , you need to use --jvm flag=... to set the property: google cloud sdk/bin/java-dev appserver.sh --jvm flag=-Ddatastore.default high rep job policy unapplied job pct=20 The valid range for datastore.default high rep job policy unapplied job pct is between 0 and 100.
- The Cloud Datastore consistency model By default, the local Datastore is configured so that the percentage of Datastore writes that are not immediately visible in global queries set to 10%.
- Note: If you require strong consistency for your query results, you need to use an ancestor query limiting the results to a single entity group.
- Specifying the Automatic ID Allocation Policy You can configure how the local Datastore assigns automatic entity IDs .
