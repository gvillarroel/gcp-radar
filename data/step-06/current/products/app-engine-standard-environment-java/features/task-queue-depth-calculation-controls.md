# Task queue depth calculation controls

Product: App Engine standard environment Java
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Task Queue avoids calculating and storing queue depth for non-existent or deleting queues and during queue table outages.

- This table compares the performance features of the three scaling types: Feature Automatic scaling Basic scaling Manual scaling Request timeout 10 minutes for HTTP requests and task queue tasks.
- Scaling and batches of requests If you are sending batches of requests to your services, for example, to a task queue for processing, a large number of instances will be created quickly.
- 24 hours for HTTP requests and task queue tasks.
- Scaling types App Engine supports the following scaling types , which controls how and when instances are created: Automatic (default) Basic Manual You specify the scaling type in your app's app.yaml .

- Final score: 66
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- It's possible to reduce request latency by configuring your application to asynchronously write HTTP session data to the Datastore: <async-session-persistence enabled="true" /> With async session persistence turned on, App Engine will submit a Task Queue task to write session data to the Datastore before writing the data to memcache.
- If your application interacts with Datastore or Task Queues operations, set up monitoring to monitor performance and behavior impacts after enabling this feature. <system-properties> <property name="appengine.use.httpconnector" value="true"/> </system-properties> Optional.
- By default the task will be submitted to the default queue.
- You will need to test your application and expected traffic volume to determine the ideal number of instances to keep in reserve. <min-pending-latency> The minimum amount of time in seconds that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting a new instance to handle it.
