# explodeWar sync behavior

Product: App Engine standard environment Java
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

The explodeWar task now uses sync instead of copy.

## Extended Definition

The explodeWar task now uses sync instead of copy.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

Evidence snippets:
- It's possible to reduce request latency by configuring your application to asynchronously write HTTP session data to the Datastore: <async-session-persistence enabled="true" /> With async session persistence turned on, App Engine will submit a Task Queue task to write session data to the Datastore before writing the data to memcache.
- If your application interacts with Datastore or Task Queues operations, set up monitoring to monitor performance and behavior impacts after enabling this feature. <system-properties> <property name="appengine.use.httpconnector" value="true"/> </system-properties> Optional.
- Uses scattered auto IDs that are large well-distributed integers that are small enough to be represented by 64-bit floats. legacy The legacy option will be deprecated in a future release and will eventually be removed.
- If you'd like to use a different queue, add the queue-name attribute: <async-session-persistence enabled="true" queue-name="myqueue"/> Session data is always written synchronously to memcache.

Evidence snippets:
- Requests from App Engine Cloud Tasks also share this pending queue priority behavior for compatibility reasons.
- With Cloud Tasks, HTTP requests are long-lived and return a response only after any asynchronous work ends.
- The following limits apply specifically to the use of request handlers: Limit Amount Request size 32 megabytes Response size 32 megabytes Request timeout Depends on the type of scaling your app uses Maximum total number of files (app files and static files) 10,000 total 1,000 per directory Maximum size of an application file 32 megabytes Maximum size of a static file 32 megabytes Maximum total size of all application and static files First 1 gigabyte is free $ 0.026 per gigabyte per month after first 1 gigabyte Pending request timeout 10 seconds Maximum size of a single request header field 8 kilobytes for second-generation runtimes in the standard environment.
- App Engine pending queue prioritization During periods of heavy traffic, App Engine might place requests in a pending queue while waiting for an available instance with the following prioritization: App Engine prioritizes other queued requests over pending queued requests from Task queue .
