Evidence snippets:
- For example: <staging> <delete-jsps>false</delete-jsps> </staging> Staging option defaults The defaults for staging options are different depending on whether you use Google Cloud SDK-based tooling, such as the gcloud CLI, or the Google Cloud SDK-based Maven , Gradle , or IntelliJ plugins.
- Element Description <application> Not required if you deploy your app using Google Cloud SDK-based tooling, such as the gcloud app deploy command, IntelliJ plugins, Maven or Gradle plugins.
- The staging element lets you specify a particular staging configuration if needed for deployment.
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.

Evidence snippets:
- Separation of deployment and traffic routing duties Many organizations prefer to separate the task of deploying an application version from the task of ramping up traffic to the newly created version, and to have these tasks done by different job functions.
- Recommended role for application deployment For an account that is responsible only for deploying new versions of an app, we recommend that you grant the following roles: App Engine Deployer role ( roles/appengine.deployer ) Service Account User role ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) The Service Account User role enables the account to impersonate the default App Engine service account during the deployment process.
- Capability App Engine Admin App Engine Service Admin App Engine Deployer App Engine Viewer App Engine Code Viewer List all services, versions and instances Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes View all application, service, version, and instance settings Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes View runtime metrics such as resource usage, load information, and error information Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes View app source code No No No No Yes Deploy a new version of an app Yes, if you also grant the Service Account User role No Yes, if you also grant the Service Account User role No No Split or migrate traffic Yes Yes No No No Start and stop a version Yes Yes No No No Delete a version Yes Yes Yes No No Delete an entire service Yes Yes No No No Use SSH to connect to a VM instance in the flexible environment Yes No No No No Shut down an instance Yes No No No No Disable and re-enable the App Engine application Yes No No No No Access handlers that have a login:admin restriction ( first generation runtimes only) Yes No No No No Update dispatch rules Yes No No No No Update DoS settings Yes No No No No Update cron schedules No No No No No Update default cookie expiration Yes No No No No Update referrers Yes No No No No Update Email API Authorized Senders Yes No No No No Note: The predefined roles are enforced in the Google Cloud console , the Admin API , and other tooling that requires access, including the deployment commands .
- Lowest-level resources where you can grant this role: Project appengine.applications.get appengine. applications. listRuntimes appengine.instances.get appengine.instances.list appengine.operations. appengine.operations.get appengine.operations.list appengine.services.get appengine.services.list appengine.versions.create appengine.versions.delete appengine.versions.get appengine.versions.list artifactregistry. projectsettings. get artifactregistry. repositories. deleteArtifacts artifactregistry. repositories. downloadArtifacts artifactregistry. repositories. uploadArtifacts recommender.locations. recommender.locations.get recommender.locations.list resourcemanager.projects.get resourcemanager.projects.list App Engine Memcache Data Admin ( roles/ appengine.memcacheDataAdmin ) Can get, set, delete, and flush App Engine Memcache items. appengine.applications.get appengine.memcache.addKey appengine.memcache.flush appengine.memcache.get appengine.memcache.update resourcemanager.projects.get resourcemanager.projects.list App Engine Service Admin ( roles/ appengine.serviceAdmin ) Read-only access to all application configuration and settings.

Evidence snippets:
- Before you begin Download the latest version of the Google Cloud CLI or update your gcloud CLI to the current version: gcloud components update To deploy using Maven, you will need to add the App Engine Maven Plugin to your pom.xml file: <plugin> <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId> <artifactId>appengine-maven-plugin</artifactId> <version>2.8.1</version> </plugin> Other options for deploying include using the gcloud app deploy command or the App Engine Gradle plugin .
- When deploying your application, the App Engine plugin will only upload the files that changed, rather than the entire uber JAR package.
- For example, an executable with the filename myexecutable could have the following app.yaml configuration file: runtime : 25 # or another supported runtime version. entrypoint : ./myexecutable Google Cloud client libraries can be used to compile applications as a GraalVM native image.
- For example, your application might be deployed at Java 21.0.4 and automatically updated to version Java 21.0.5 at a later deployment of the managed platform, but it won't be automatically updated to Java 22.
