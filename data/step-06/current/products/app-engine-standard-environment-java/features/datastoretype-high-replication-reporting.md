# DatastoreType high replication reporting

Product: App Engine standard environment Java
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

DatastoreType now always returns high replication.

## Extended Definition

DatastoreType now always returns high replication.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

- A high maximum means users might wait longer for their requests to be served (if there are pending requests and no idle instances to serve them), but your application will cost less to run. min pending latency An optional element you can set to specify the minimum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting a new instance to handle it.
- Python example handlers : - url : /youraccount/. secure : always script : auto To target a specific version of your app using the REGION ID .r.appspot.com domain, you replace the periods that would usually separate the subdomain components of the URL with the string " -dot- ", for example: https:// VERSION ID -dot-default-dot- PROJECT ID .
- Example automatic scaling : target cpu utilization : 0.65 min instances : 5 max instances : 100 min pending latency : 30ms max pending latency : automatic max concurrent requests : 50 basic scaling Applications that use an instance class of B1 or higher must specify either this element or manual scaling .

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-4`
- Final score: 54
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If you're expecting extremely high traffic levels, or for some reason your app requires particularly high quotas (for example, because of a significant product launch or large load tests), we recommend that you sign up for a support package .
- For resources that are required to initiate a request, when the resource is depleted, App Engine by default returns an HTTP 403 or 503 error code for the request instead of calling a request handler.
- Sending mail above your daily mail quota If your app needs higher quotas for sending mail, you can use a third-party mail provider, such as SendGrid , Mailjet , or Mailgun .
- App Engine resets all resource measurements at the beginning of each calendar day (except for Stored Data, which always represents the amount of datastore storage in use).

- This parameter specifies the CPU usage threshold at which new instances will be started to handle traffic, enabling you to balance between performance and cost, with lower values increasing performance and increasing cost, and higher values decreasing performance but also decreasing cost.
