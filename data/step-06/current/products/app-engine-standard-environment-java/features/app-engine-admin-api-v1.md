Evidence snippets:
- Small Operations Unlimited Note: Datastore operations generated by the Datastore Admin and Datastore Viewer count against your application quota.
- The following example illustrates how to catch the OverQuotaError , which may be raised by the SendMessage() method if an email-related quota has been exceeded: try: mail.SendMessage ( to = 'test@example.com' , from = 'admin@example.com' , subject = 'Test Email' , body = 'Testing' ) except apiproxy errors.OverQuotaError, message: Log the error. logging.error(message) Display an informative message to the user. self.response.out.write ( 'The email could not be sent. ' 'Please try again later.' ) Is your app exceeding the default limits?
- The Cloud Quotas system does the following: Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services Restricts your consumption of those resources Provides a way to request changes to the quota value and automate quota adjustments In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that you're trying to perform fails.
- Resource Default limit Default Cloud Storage Bucket Stored Data First 5 GB free; no maximum Default Cloud Storage Bucket Class A Operations First 20,000 ops/day free; no maximum Default Cloud Storage Bucket Class B Operations First 50,000 ops/day free; no maximum Default Cloud Storage Bucket Network Egress First 1 GB free; no maximum Blobstore The following quotas apply specifically to use of the blobstore.
