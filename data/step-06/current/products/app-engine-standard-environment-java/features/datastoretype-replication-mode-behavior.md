### "Creating App Engine firewall rules \_|\_ App Engine standard environment\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/creating-firewalls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/creating-firewalls)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-2`
- Final score: 73
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Run the following command to view a list of the existing rules: gcloud app firewall-rules list Run the following command to delete an existing rule: gcloud app firewall-rules delete PRIORITY where PRIORITY is the priority value of the rule that you want to delete.
- Run the following command to test your rule and ensure that the priority and action provide the expected behavior: gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip IP ADDRESS where IP ADDRESS is the IP address that you want to test against your firewall.
- To test a firewall rule and ensure that the priority and action provide the expected behavior, you can use the apps.firewall.ingressRules.list method and specify the IP address that you want to test within the matchingAddress parameter.
- Firewall rule priority The firewall rules are ordered by importance, which you define as a numerical value in each rule's priority.

### "App Engine app.yaml reference \_|\_ App Engine standard environment \_|\_\

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 69
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Example The following is an example of an app.yaml file: runtime : python314 instance class : F2 env variables : BUCKET NAME : "example-gcs-bucket" handlers : Matches requests to /images/... to files in static/images/... - url : /images static dir : static/images - url : /. secure : always redirect http response code : 301 script : auto The following table provides YAML examples of available fields in an app.yaml file: Runtime and app elements Element Description app engine apis Optional.
- For more information about the possible MIME media types, see the IANA MIME Media Types website . redirect http response code Optional. redirect http response code is used with the secure setting to set the HTTP response code returned when performing a redirect required by how the secure setting is configured. redirect http response code element has the following possible values: 301 Moved Permanently response code.
- Python example handlers : - url : /youraccount/. secure : always script : auto To target a specific version of your app using the REGION ID .r.appspot.com domain, you replace the periods that would usually separate the subdomain components of the URL with the string " -dot- ", for example: https:// VERSION ID -dot-default-dot- PROJECT ID .
- The following values are available depending on your service's scaling : Automatic scaling F1 , F2 , F4 , F4 1G Default: F1 Optionally use the automatic scaling element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as minimum and maximum number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections.

### "appengine-web.xml reference \_|\_ App Engine standard environment \_|\_\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java-gen2/config/appref-xml](https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java-gen2/config/appref-xml)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 65
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If your application interacts with Datastore or Task Queues operations, set up monitoring to monitor performance and behavior impacts after enabling this feature. <system-properties> <property name="appengine.use.httpconnector" value="true"/> </system-properties> Optional.
- The following example demonstrates how to designate all png files as static files (except those in the data/ directory and all of its subdirectories): < static - files > < include path = "/ .png" / > < exclude path = "/data/ .png" / > < / static - files > You can also set HTTP headers to use when responding to requests to these static resources. < static - files > < include path = "/my static-files" > < http - header name = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value = "http://example.org" / > < / include > < / static - files > Note: If the path string doesn't start with a slash, then the HTTP headers, if any, work on App Engine but do not work on the Development Server.
- The appengine-web.xml file can define environment variables that are set when the application is running. <env-variables> <env-var name="DEFAULT ENCODING" value="UTF-8" /> </env-variables> To avoid conflicts with your local environment, the development server does not set environment variables based on this file, and requires that the local environment have these variables already set to matching values. export DEFAULT ENCODING = "UTF-8" dev appserver war When deployed to App Engine, the environment is created with these variables already set.
- The appengine-web.xml file can define system properties and environment variables that are set when the application is running. <system-properties> <property name="myapp.maximum-message-length" value="140" /> <property name="myapp.notify-every-n-signups" value="1000" /> <property name="myapp.notify-url" value="http://www.example.com/signupnotify" /> </system-properties> <env-variables> <env-var name="DEFAULT ENCODING" value="UTF-8" /> </env-variables> Optional.
