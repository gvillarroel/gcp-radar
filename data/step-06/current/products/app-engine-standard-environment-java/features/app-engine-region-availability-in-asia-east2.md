- Python example handlers : - url : /youraccount/. secure : always script : auto To target a specific version of your app using the REGION ID .r.appspot.com domain, you replace the periods that would usually separate the subdomain components of the URL with the string " -dot- ", for example: https:// VERSION ID -dot-default-dot- PROJECT ID .
- The following values are available depending on your service's scaling : Automatic scaling F1 , F2 , F4 , F4 1G Default: F1 Optionally use the automatic scaling element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as minimum and maximum number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections.
- Example vpc access connector : name : "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME " egress setting : all-traffic Handlers element The handlers element provides a list of URL patterns and descriptions of how they should be handled.

- Specify the fully-qualified name of a connector in the <name> element: <vpc-access-connector> <name>projects/[PROJECT ID]/locations/[REGION]/connectors/[CONNECTOR NAME]</name> </vpc-access-connector> For more information, see Connecting to internal resources in a VPC network .
- Default: F1 is assigned if you don't specify an instance class along with the automatic scaling element. basic scaling When using basic scaling, the B1, B2, B4, B4 1G, and B8 instance classes are available.
- Default: B2 is assigned if you don't specify a instance class along with the basic scaling element. manual scaling When using manual scaling, the B1, B2, B4, B4 1G, and B8 instance classes are available.
- If a request tries to read the session data when memcache is not available (or the session data has been flushed), it will fail over to Datastore, which might not yet have the most recent session data.
