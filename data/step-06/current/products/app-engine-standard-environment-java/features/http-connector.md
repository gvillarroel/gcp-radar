# HTTP connector

Product: App Engine standard environment Java
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

App Engine standard environment Java can use an HTTP connector to improve CPU and memory utilization.

## Extended Definition

App Engine standard environment Java can use an HTTP connector to improve CPU and memory utilization.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

Evidence snippets:
- If your application interacts with Datastore or Task Queues operations, set up monitoring to monitor performance and behavior impacts after enabling this feature. <system-properties> <property name="appengine.use.httpconnector" value="true"/> </system-properties> Optional.
- You can configure an HTTP connector for improving CPU and memory utilization.
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- The following example demonstrates how to designate all png files as static files (except those in the data/ directory and all of its subdirectories): < static - files > < include path = "/ .png" / > < exclude path = "/data/ .png" / > < / static - files > You can also set HTTP headers to use when responding to requests to these static resources. < static - files > < include path = "/my static-files" > < http - header name = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value = "http://example.org" / > < / include > < / static - files > Note: If the path string doesn't start with a slash, then the HTTP headers, if any, work on App Engine but do not work on the Development Server.

- For more information about the possible MIME media types, see the IANA MIME Media Types website . redirect http response code Optional. redirect http response code is used with the secure setting to set the HTTP response code returned when performing a redirect required by how the secure setting is configured. redirect http response code element has the following possible values: 301 Moved Permanently response code.
- This prevents a user from accidentally submitting query data over a non-secure connection that was intended for a secure connection. always Requests for a URL that match this handler that do not use HTTPS are automatically redirected to the HTTPS URL with the same path.
- To target a specific version of your app using the REGION ID .r.appspot.com domain, you replace the periods that would usually separate the subdomain components of the URL with the string " -dot- ", for example: https:// VERSION ID -dot-default-dot- PROJECT ID .
