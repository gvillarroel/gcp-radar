Evidence snippets:
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- Example <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <application>simple-app</application> <module>default</module> <version>uno</version> <instance-class>B8</instance-class> <manual-scaling> <instances>5</instances> </manual-scaling> </appengine-web-app> Staging elements Much of the work done during a deployment occurs locally in a preparation step called staging , where JAR files are assembled, JSPs are compiled, and so forth.
- App Engine Java applications use a configuration file, named appengine-web.xml , to specify information about your app and to identify which files in the app's WAR file are static files (like images) and which are resource files used by the application.
- This idle timeout configuration isn't the same as the overall request deadline for scaling, or the URL Fetch API deadline that you configure using appengine.api.urlfetch.defaultDeadline . <inbound-services> Optional.

- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Directory structure Each version of your App Engine service is defined in an app.yaml configuration file.
- Similarly, both service2 and service3 are in separate directories, which contain each service's files, although service3 includes two versions of the YAML configuration file: In the following example, a single service has the optional dispatch.yaml file and two configuration files that represent different versions of that service, service1.yaml and service2.yaml : Design considerations for instance uptime Hardware or software failures that cause early termination or frequent instance restarts can occur without warning and can take considerable time to resolve.
- See the following topics for details about each of the optional features: cron.yaml configures regularly scheduled tasks that operate at defined times or regular intervals. dispatch.yaml overrides routing default rules by sending incoming requests to a specific service based on the path or hostname in the URL. index.yaml specifies which indexes your app needs if using Datastore queries.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The following limits apply to task queues according to their type: Push Queue Limits Maximum task size 100KB Queue execution rate 500 task invocations per second per queue Maximum countdown/ETA for a task 30 days from the current date and time Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a batch 100 tasks Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a transaction 5 tasks Default maximum number of task queues 100 queues.
- This includes indexes that were created in the past and no longer appear in the application's configuration but have not been deleted.
- Deployments In each App Engine application, you can deploy up to 10,000 times per day.
- Resource Daily limit Maximum rate UrlFetch API calls 860,000,000 calls 660,000 calls/minute UrlFetch data sent 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute UrlFetch data received 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute Networking limits The following networking limits apply to App Engine: Outbound connections per second per instance: 500 (cannot be increased) Outbound DNS resolutions per second per instance: 100 (cannot be increased) Maximum packets per second per instance: 80,000 Maximum bits per second per instance: 100,000,000 Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
