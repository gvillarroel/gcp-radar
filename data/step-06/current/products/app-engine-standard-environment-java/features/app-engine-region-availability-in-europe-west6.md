Evidence snippets:
- App Engine Locations App Engine is regional , which means the infrastructure that runs your apps is located in a specific region, and Google manages it so that it is available redundantly across all of the zones within that region .
- You can generally select the region nearest to your app's users, but you should consider the locations where App Engine is available as well as the locations of the other Google Cloud products and services that your app uses.
- Meeting your latency, availability, or durability requirements are primary factors for selecting the region where your apps are run.
- Run the following command to select a region and create an App Engine application: gcloud app create More information about App Engine locations help outline Enable billing in the Billing page of the Google Cloud console, see Enabling billing for details.
