Evidence snippets:
- Task Queue When a task executes, its associated requests count toward the application request quotas These limits apply to all task queues: Resource Daily limit Maximum rate Task Queue management calls (using the Google Cloud console) 10,000 n/a Resource Default limit Maximum number of queues (includes both push and pull queues but not the default queue) 100 queues.
- Resource Default daily limit Maximum rate Recipients emailed 100 messages 8 messages/minute Admins emailed 5,000 mails 24 mails/minute Message body data sent 60 MB 340 KB/minute Attachments sent 2,000 attachments 8 attachments/minute Attachment data sent 100 MB 10 MB/minute You can add up to a maximum of 50 authorized senders for the Mail API.
- Description Limit Maximum characters in Project URL for VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT ID URL 63 Default Cloud Storage bucket The Default Cloud Storage bucket has a free quota for daily usage as shown below.
- Daily quotas protect the integrity of the App Engine system by ensuring that no single app over-consumes a resource to the detriment of other apps.

Evidence snippets:
- Before you can deploy your apps to the App Engine standard environment, you typically need to create or set up the following: A Google Cloud project An App Engine application A billing account Creating a project and application You can select or create a new Google Cloud project and App Engine application to create and manage a collection of settings, credentials, and your app's metadata.
- App Engine Locations App Engine is regional , which means the infrastructure that runs your apps is located in a specific region, and Google manages it so that it is available redundantly across all of the zones within that region .
- Tips: If you deploy your apps with the gcloud app deploy command, the gcloud CLI will ensure that your Google Cloud project includes an App Engine application and prompt you to select a region when needed.
- To create a budget and set alerts in a Google Cloud project: In the Google Cloud console, go to the Billing page: Go to Billing Click the billing account for which you want to create a budget.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-4`
- Final score: 81
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The appengine-web.xml file can define environment variables that are set when the application is running. <env-variables> <env-var name="DEFAULT ENCODING" value="UTF-8" /> </env-variables> To avoid conflicts with your local environment, the development server does not set environment variables based on this file, and requires that the local environment have these variables already set to matching values. export DEFAULT ENCODING = "UTF-8" dev appserver war When deployed to App Engine, the environment is created with these variables already set.
- Warmup requests are enabled by default for Java applications.
- Most applications don't need to change default behavior.
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
