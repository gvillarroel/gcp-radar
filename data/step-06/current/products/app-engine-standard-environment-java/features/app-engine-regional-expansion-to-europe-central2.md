- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 44
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- App Engine Locations App Engine is regional , which means the infrastructure that runs your apps is located in a specific region, and Google manages it so that it is available redundantly across all of the zones within that region .
- You can generally select the region nearest to your app's users, but you should consider the locations where App Engine is available as well as the locations of the other Google Cloud products and services that your app uses.
- Note: Two locations, which are called europe-west and us-central in App Engine commands and in the Google Cloud console, are called europe-west1 and us-central1 , respectively, elsewhere in Google documentation.
- Important: Each Google Cloud project can contain only a single App Engine application, and once created you cannot change the location of your App Engine application. gcloud After installing Google Cloud CLI , an account with the Google Cloud project Owner role can run the following gcloud commands to create a Google Cloud project and App Engine application: Run the following command to create a Google Cloud project: gcloud projects create PROJECT ID Replace PROJECT ID with the Google Cloud project ID.

Evidence snippets:
- To make your connector appear when principals view available connectors in the Google Cloud console or from their terminal, add IAM roles for principals who deploy App Engine services.
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Provide access to the connector Provide access to the connector by granting the Serverless VPC Access User IAM role on the host project to the principal that deploys your App Engine service.
- Click Save . gcloud Run the following in your terminal: gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding HOST PROJECT ID \ --member= PRINCIPAL \ --role=roles/vpcaccess.user Replace the following: HOST PROJECT ID : the ID of the Shared VPC host project PRINCIPAL : the principal that deploys your App Engine service.
- Click Save . gcloud Run the following in your terminal: gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding SERVICE PROJECT ID \ --member= PRINCIPAL \ --role=roles/compute.networkViewer Replace the following: SERVICE PROJECT ID : the ID of the service project PRINCIPAL : the principal who deploys App Engine services.
