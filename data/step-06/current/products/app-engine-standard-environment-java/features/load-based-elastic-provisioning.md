Evidence snippets:
- The appengine-web.xml file can define environment variables that are set when the application is running. <env-variables> <env-var name="DEFAULT ENCODING" value="UTF-8" /> </env-variables> To avoid conflicts with your local environment, the development server does not set environment variables based on this file, and requires that the local environment have these variables already set to matching values. export DEFAULT ENCODING = "UTF-8" dev appserver war When deployed to App Engine, the environment is created with these variables already set.
- This can impact class loading order, so if your app depends on a certain order using the former false default, you can set this to false . delete-jsps false true compile-encoding utf-8 utf-8 Include and exclude syntax Path patterns are specified using zero or more <include> and <exclude> elements.
- For example: <staging> <delete-jsps>false</delete-jsps> </staging> Staging option defaults The defaults for staging options are different depending on whether you use Google Cloud SDK-based tooling, such as the gcloud CLI, or the Google Cloud SDK-based Maven , Gradle , or IntelliJ plugins.
- With warmup requests enabled, the App Engine infrastructure issues GET requests to / ah/warmup , initializing <load-on-startup> servlets, ServletContextListeners , and custom warmup servlets, which allow you to initialize your application's code as it requires.

Evidence snippets:
- Example automatic scaling : target cpu utilization : 0.65 min instances : 5 max instances : 100 min pending latency : 30ms max pending latency : automatic max concurrent requests : 50 basic scaling Applications that use an instance class of B1 or higher must specify either this element or manual scaling .
- All URLs that begin with this prefix are handled by this handler, using the portion of the URL after the prefix as part of the file path. static files A static file pattern handler associates a URL pattern with paths to static files uploaded with the application.
- For example, if App Engine calculates that 5 instances are necessary to serve traffic, and min idle instances is set to 2, App Engine will run 7 instances (5, calculated based on traffic, plus 2 additional per min idle instances ).
