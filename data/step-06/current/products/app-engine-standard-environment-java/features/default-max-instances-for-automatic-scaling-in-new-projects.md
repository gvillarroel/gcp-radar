Evidence snippets:
- Note: For new projects you create after March 2025, App Engine sets the automatic scaling maximum instances default for standard environment deployments to 20.
- Scaling types App Engine supports the following scaling types , which controls how and when instances are created: Automatic (default) Basic Manual You specify the scaling type in your app's app.yaml .
- By default, your app uses automatic scaling, which means App Engine will manage the number of idle instances.
- Scaling dynamic instances App Engine applications that use basic or automatic scaling are powered by any number of dynamic instances at a given time, depending on the volume of incoming requests.

- The following values are available depending on your service's scaling : Automatic scaling F1 , F2 , F4 , F4 1G Default: F1 Optionally use the automatic scaling element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as minimum and maximum number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections.
- Specify this element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as setting minimum and maximum levels for number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections for a service.
- Note: For new projects you create after March 2025, App Engine sets the maximum instances default for standard environment deployments to 20.
- If not specified, the default value is automatic , which means App Engine will manage the number of idle instances.
