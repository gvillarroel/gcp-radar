- Re-rank rationale: The guide includes explicit instructions for using Serverless VPC Access connectors with Shared VPC networks in App Engine Standard.

Evidence snippets:
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- Test the custom constraint To test the example that restricts ingress settings, deploy a connector in the project with network set to default : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create org-policy-test \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION ID \ --network = default The output is the following: Operation denied by custom org policies: ["customConstraints/custom.defaultNetworkConstraint": "Require network to not be set to default."] Example custom organization policies for common use cases The following table provides examples of custom constraints that you might find useful with Serverless VPC Access connectors: Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors can only use a specific network. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.allowlistNetworks resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.network == 'allowlisted-network'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : allowlistNetworks description : Require connectors to use a specific network.
- However, if you create a connector in a service project and the connector targets a Shared VPC network in the host project, you must add firewall rules to allow necessary traffic for the connector's operation from the following ranges: Serverless infrastructure IP range : 35.199.224.0/19 Health check probe IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 , 35.191.192.0/18 , and 130.211.0.0/22 These ranges are used by the Google infrastructure underlying Cloud Run, Cloud Run functions, and App Engine standard environment.
- Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors have access to only a specific subnet. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.restrictSubnetForProject resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.subnet.name == 'allocated-subnet'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : restrictSubnetForProject description : This project is only allowed to use the subnet "allocated-subnet".

- Go to Google Cloud console dashboard In the menu bar at the top of the dashboard, click the project dropdown menu and select the host project. gcloud Set the default project in the gcloud CLI to the host project by running the following in your terminal: gcloud config set project HOST PROJECT ID Replace the following: HOST PROJECT ID : the ID of the Shared VPC host project Create a Serverless VPC Access connector To send requests to your VPC network and receive the corresponding responses, you must create a Serverless VPC Access connector.
- If your organization uses Shared VPC, you can set up a Serverless VPC Access connector in either the service project or the host project.
- A green check mark will appear next to the connector's name when it is ready to use. gcloud Update gcloud components to the latest version: gcloud components update Enable the Serverless VPC Access API for your project: gcloud services enable vpcaccess.googleapis.com Create a Serverless VPC Access connector: gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create CONNECTOR NAME \ --region = REGION \ --subnet = SUBNET \ --subnet-project = HOST PROJECT ID \ Optional: specify minimum and maximum instance values between 2 and 10, default is 2 min, 10 max. --min-instances = MIN \ --max-instances = MAX \ Optional: specify machine type, default is e2-micro --machine-type = MACHINE TYPE Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : a name for your connector.
