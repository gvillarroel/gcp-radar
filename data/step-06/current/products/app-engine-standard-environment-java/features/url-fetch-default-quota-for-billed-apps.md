Evidence snippets:
- Resource Daily limit Maximum rate UrlFetch API calls 860,000,000 calls 660,000 calls/minute UrlFetch data sent 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute UrlFetch data received 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute Networking limits The following networking limits apply to App Engine: Outbound connections per second per instance: 500 (cannot be increased) Outbound DNS resolutions per second per instance: 100 (cannot be increased) Maximum packets per second per instance: 80,000 Maximum bits per second per instance: 100,000,000 Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- The following example illustrates how to catch the OverQuotaError , which may be raised by the SendMessage() method if an email-related quota has been exceeded: try: mail.SendMessage ( to = 'test@example.com' , from = 'admin@example.com' , subject = 'Test Email' , body = 'Testing' ) except apiproxy errors.OverQuotaError, message: Log the error. logging.error(message) Display an informative message to the user. self.response.out.write ( 'The email could not be sent. ' 'Please try again later.' ) Is your app exceeding the default limits?
- Resource Default limit Default Cloud Storage Bucket Stored Data First 5 GB free; no maximum Default Cloud Storage Bucket Class A Operations First 20,000 ops/day free; no maximum Default Cloud Storage Bucket Class B Operations First 50,000 ops/day free; no maximum Default Cloud Storage Bucket Network Egress First 1 GB free; no maximum Blobstore The following quotas apply specifically to use of the blobstore.
- Task Queue When a task executes, its associated requests count toward the application request quotas These limits apply to all task queues: Resource Daily limit Maximum rate Task Queue management calls (using the Google Cloud console) 10,000 n/a Resource Default limit Maximum number of queues (includes both push and pull queues but not the default queue) 100 queues.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-4`
- Final score: 152
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The appengine-web.xml file can define environment variables that are set when the application is running. <env-variables> <env-var name="DEFAULT ENCODING" value="UTF-8" /> </env-variables> To avoid conflicts with your local environment, the development server does not set environment variables based on this file, and requires that the local environment have these variables already set to matching values. export DEFAULT ENCODING = "UTF-8" dev appserver war When deployed to App Engine, the environment is created with these variables already set.
- To serve custom error pages, add a <static-error-handlers> section to your appengine-web.xml , as ins this example: <static-error-handlers> <handler file="default error.html" /> <handler file="over quota.html" error-code="over quota" /> </static-error-handlers> Warning : Make sure that the path to the error response file does not overlap with static file handler paths.
- Specify the timeout in seconds: < system - properties > < property name = "appengine.api.urlfetch.defaultDeadline" value = "10" / > < / system - properties > Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- This idle timeout configuration isn't the same as the overall request deadline for scaling, or the URL Fetch API deadline that you configure using appengine.api.urlfetch.defaultDeadline . <inbound-services> Optional.

- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- To target a specific version of your app using the REGION ID .r.appspot.com domain, you replace the periods that would usually separate the subdomain components of the URL with the string " -dot- ", for example: https:// VERSION ID -dot-default-dot- PROJECT ID .
- Example error handlers : - file : default error.html - error code : over quota file : over quota.html handlers Optional.
- Applications must enable those services before it can receive inbound requests.
- For free apps, the default value is 500ms .
