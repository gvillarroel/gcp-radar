Evidence snippets:
- For example, if you want to pull a user's data from Google Drive and bring it into your app, use OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications to share specific data while keeping other data, such as usernames and passwords, private.
- If you don't specify credentials when constructing // the client, the client library will look for credentials in the // environment. const storage = new Storage (); // Makes an authenticated API request. async function listBuckets () { try { const results = await storage . getBuckets (); const [ buckets ] = results ; console . log ( 'Buckets:' ); buckets . forEach ( bucket = > { console . log ( bucket . name ); }); } catch ( err ) { console . error ( 'ERROR:' , err ); } } listBuckets (); PHP // Imports the Cloud Storage client library. use Google\Cloud\Storage\StorageClient; / Authenticate to a cloud client library using a service account implicitly. @param string $projectId The Google project ID. / function auth cloud implicit($projectId) { $config = [ 'projectId' => $projectId, ]; If you don't specify credentials when constructing the client, the client library will look for credentials in the environment. $storage = new StorageClient($config); Make an authenticated API request (listing storage buckets) foreach ($storage->buckets() as $bucket) { printf('Bucket: %s' .
- If you set the GOOGLE APPLICATION CREDENTIALS environment variable or pass credentials in your code, we recommend that you store your credentials in one of the following ways: Store your credentials in a secure location such as Firestore in Datastore mode (Datastore) and retrieve them at runtime.
- A user account can be used to authenticate from the following tools: Google Cloud console Google Cloud CLI IDEs and build tools that use the gcloud CLI to test and deploy App Engine apps A service account , which is intended to represent an application or a process instead of a person.
