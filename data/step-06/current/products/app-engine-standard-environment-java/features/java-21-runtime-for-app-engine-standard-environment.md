- The runtime's Open JDK environment App Engine runs Java apps in a container secured by gVisor on an up-to-date Ubuntu Linux distribution and its supported openjdk-17-jdk for Java 17 or openjdk-21-jdk for Java 21 runtime.
- For example, your application might be deployed at Java 21.0.4 and automatically updated to version Java 21.0.5 at a later deployment of the managed platform, but it won't be automatically updated to Java 22.
