- Console To use Grounding with Google Maps with Vertex AI, follow these steps: In the Google Cloud console, go to the Vertex AI Studio page.
- Go to Vertex AI Studio In the Tools section, click Grounding: Google .
- The Routing tool supports the following: Modes of transportation : Routing for driving, walking, bicycling, transit, and two-wheeled motorized vehicles (not all travel modes are available in all countries) Multiple waypoints : Up to 13 intermediate stops between origin and destination Real-time traffic : Accounting for current traffic conditions to provide accurate "live" travel times rather than static averages The following are examples of the types of questions that the Routing tool supports: Proximity based on travel time : "What are some American restaurants within a 10-minute walk from the Hilton Hotel on 1335 6th Ave in NYC?" Commute estimation : "How long does it take to take public transit from Pike Place Market to Capitol Hill in Seattle?" Understand the response When a prompt triggers the Routing tool, the model generates a natural language answer backed by structured metadata.
