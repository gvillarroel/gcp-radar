- Your administrator might also be able to give the Compute Engine default service account the required permissions through custom roles or other predefined roles .
- Delete model resources From within the Gradio app, you can delete model endpoints to clean up Vertex AI resources.
- Required roles for users To get the permissions that you need to test model capabilities in Model Garden, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your Google Cloud project: Service Usage Admin ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ) Artifact Registry Administrator ( roles/artifactregistry.admin ) Cloud Run Admin ( roles/run.admin ) Storage Admin ( roles/storage.admin ) Vertex AI User ( roles/aiplatform.user ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .

Evidence snippets:
- The Routing tool supports the following: Modes of transportation : Routing for driving, walking, bicycling, transit, and two-wheeled motorized vehicles (not all travel modes are available in all countries) Multiple waypoints : Up to 13 intermediate stops between origin and destination Real-time traffic : Accounting for current traffic conditions to provide accurate "live" travel times rather than static averages The following are examples of the types of questions that the Routing tool supports: Proximity based on travel time : "What are some American restaurants within a 10-minute walk from the Hilton Hotel on 1335 6th Ave in NYC?" Commute estimation : "How long does it take to take public transit from Pike Place Market to Capitol Hill in Seattle?" Understand the response When a prompt triggers the Routing tool, the model generates a natural language answer backed by structured metadata.
- This data gives you access to information on over 250 million places that can be used to ground your model's responses, enabling your AI applications and agents to provide local data and geospatial context.
- The contextual widget is rendered using the context token, googleMapsWidgetContextToken , which is returned in the Vertex AI API response and can be used to render visual content.
- By grounding responses in Google Maps's routing engine, your model can provide performance-optimized directions and accurate travel times that account for real-time conditions.
