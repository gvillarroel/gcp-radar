Evidence snippets:
- For example, in image generation, feature extraction might involve identifying edges, textures, and colors.
- However, for generative tasks like summarization and text generation, other metrics like Rough-L score might be more appropriate. feature In machine learning (ML), a feature is a characteristic or attribute of an instance or entity that's used as an input to train an ML model or to make inferences. feature extraction In the context of generative AI, feature extraction refers to the process of identifying and selecting relevant features from input data to be used in model training.
- For deployed models, continuous monitoring and capturing of common data points and edge cases help improve future validation efforts. vector A vector refers to a numerical representation of text, images, or videos that captures relationships between inputs.
- For more information, see Create a dataset . data transformation In the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), data transformation refers to the conversion of data into a format suitable for indexing and processing by an LLM.
