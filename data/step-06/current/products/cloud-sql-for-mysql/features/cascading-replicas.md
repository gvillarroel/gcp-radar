# Cascading Replicas

Product: Cloud SQL for MySQL
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Cascading Replicas became generally available, allowing Cloud SQL read replicas to have read replicas under them.

## Extended Definition

Cascading Replicas became generally available, allowing Cloud SQL read replicas to have read replicas under them.

- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Create the new replica by specifying your primary replica as the primary instance using the --master-instance-name flag: gcloud sql instances create REPLICA NAME \ --master-instance-name = PARENT REPLICA NAME \ Replace the following: REPLICA NAME : the unique ID for the replica that you are creating PARENT REPLICA NAME : the name of the parent replica After you create the cascading replica, you can see that the changes made to the primary instance are replicated through all the replicas in the cascading replicas chain. curl If you are using MySQL version 5.7 or later, enable binary logging: To enable binary logging, save the following JSON in a file named request.JSON, then invoke the curl command to enable binary logging. { "settings" : { "backupConfiguration" : { "enabled" : false, "binaryLogEnabled" : true } } } To create a replica under the parent replica, edit the following JSON code sample, and save it to a file called request.json : { "masterInstanceName" : " PARENT REPLICA NAME " , "project" : " PROJECT ID " , "name" : " REPLICA NAME " , "region" : " REPLICA REGION " , "settings" : { "tier" : " MACHINE TYPE " , } } Run the following command: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer " $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -d @request.json "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances" Troubleshoot Issue Troubleshooting Read replica didn't start replicating on creation.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method PATCH -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ REPLICA INSTANCE NAME ", "status": "PENDING", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2020-01-16T02:32:12.281Z", "operationType": "CREATE REPLICA", "name": " OPERATION ID ", "targetId": " REPLICA INSTANCE NAME ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "targetProject": " PROJECT ID " } Configure read replicas for IAM database authentication Read replicas do not have the cloudsql iam authentication flag enabled automatically when it is enabled on the primary instance.
- If the primary instance has a private IP connection and the instance accepts database connections from Cloud SQL Language Connectors only, then you can't create read replicas for the instance.

- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- ERROR REPLICA DEPTH LIMIT EXCEEDED Requested operation would cause exceeding the limit of 4 levels on the depth of cascading replicas.
- ERROR DISALLOWED ENABLING BACKUPS FOR READ REPLICA A backup can't be enabled for read replicas.
- ERROR SSL CERTIFICATE COMMON NAME ALREADY EXISTS The operation failed to generate a client certificate because another certificate with the same common name exists.
- ERROR READ REPLICA UNDER EXTERNAL SERVER REPLICA NOT SYNCED To have a read replica, there must be an initial sync completed on the external server replica.

Evidence snippets:
- In addition to operations that aren't supported on read replicas, the following operations aren't supported on read pools: Enable and disable replication Promote replica Restart Import Export Failover Re-encrypt Clone SSL/TLS certificates with shared CA or customer-managed CA can't be used with a read pool.
- Limitations The following limitations apply: Read pools are only available for Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition instances on the new network architecture .
- Traffic can be served from a lagging read pool node even if another read pool node is available that isn't lagging.
- A read pool can't replicate to another instance, for example, a cascading replica or another read pool.
