- AUTOMATIC ROTATION DURING MAINTENANCE : With this option, automatic server certificate rotation is enabled during Cloud SQL scheduled maintenance or self-service maintenance updates.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method PUT -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id /users?host=%25&name=root" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id ", "status": "DONE", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2019-09-26T14:32:30.592Z", "startTime": "2019-09-26T14:32:30.594Z", "endTime": "2019-09-26T14:32:33.518Z", "operationType": "UPDATE USER", "name": " operation-id ", "targetId": " instance-id ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /operations/ operation-id ", "targetProject": " project-id " } Retrieve the IPv4 address Retrieve the automatically assigned IPv4 address for the new instance: Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: project-id : your project ID instance-id : instance ID created in prior step HTTP method and URL: GET https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
