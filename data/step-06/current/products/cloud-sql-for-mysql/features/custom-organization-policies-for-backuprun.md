- Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) organization policies Cloud SQL supports two organization policy constraints that help ensure CMEK protection across an organization: constraints/gcp.restrictNonCmekServices and constraints/gcp.restrictCmekCryptoKeyProjects .
- The types of organization policies specific to Cloud SQL are as follows: Predefined organization policies Connection organization policies Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) organization policies Custom organization policies Predefined organization policies You can use the predefined constraints to control the public IP settings and Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) settings of Cloud SQL instances.
- Custom organization policies For granular, customizable control over the settings, you can create custom constraints and use those custom constraints in a custom organization policy.
- There are also custom organization policies that can be used to enforce connection organization policies.
