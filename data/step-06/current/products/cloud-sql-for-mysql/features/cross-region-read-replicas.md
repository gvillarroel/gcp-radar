# Cross-region read replicas

Product: Cloud SQL for MySQL
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Cloud SQL supports read replicas in a different region from the primary instance for resilience and nearby reads.

## Extended Definition

Cloud SQL supports read replicas in a different region from the primary instance for resilience and nearby reads.

Evidence snippets:
- You can create this replica in either the same region or in a different region from the primary instance ( cross-region read replica ).
- Create the new replica by specifying your primary replica as the primary instance using the --master-instance-name flag: gcloud sql instances create REPLICA NAME \ --master-instance-name = PARENT REPLICA NAME \ Replace the following: REPLICA NAME : the unique ID for the replica that you are creating PARENT REPLICA NAME : the name of the parent replica After you create the cascading replica, you can see that the changes made to the primary instance are replicated through all the replicas in the cascading replicas chain. curl If you are using MySQL version 5.7 or later, enable binary logging: To enable binary logging, save the following JSON in a file named request.JSON, then invoke the curl command to enable binary logging. { "settings" : { "backupConfiguration" : { "enabled" : false, "binaryLogEnabled" : true } } } To create a replica under the parent replica, edit the following JSON code sample, and save it to a file called request.json : { "masterInstanceName" : " PARENT REPLICA NAME " , "project" : " PROJECT ID " , "name" : " REPLICA NAME " , "region" : " REPLICA REGION " , "settings" : { "tier" : " MACHINE TYPE " , } } Run the following command: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer " $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -d @request.json "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances" Troubleshoot Issue Troubleshooting Read replica didn't start replicating on creation.
- It also can't replicate from an instance that supports external IP connections or from an instance that's configured with private services access . gcloud To create a read replica of an instance, use the gcloud sql instances create command: gcloud sql instances create REPLICA INSTANCE NAME \ --master-instance-name = PRIMARY INSTANCE NAME \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION NAME \ --enable-private-service-connect \ --allowed-psc-projects = ALLOWED PROJECTS \ --availability-type = AVAILABILITY TYPE \ --no-assign-ip Make the following replacements: REPLICA INSTANCE NAME : the name of the replica instance.
- If a replica is a cross-region replica , you can perform a failover to another region; specifically, you can promote a replica to a standalone instance (in which case, existing replicas would not consider that instance as primary).

- Determines whether an in-place major version upgrade of replicas happens when an in-place major version upgrade of a primary instance is initiated. nodeCount integer The number of read pool nodes in a read pool.
- A DR replica is a cross-region replica that you designate for failover in the event that the primary instance experiences regional failure.

- Final score: 166
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Only a zonal replica located in the same region as the primary can be converted for use in a read pool.
- Like read replicas, read pools receive maintenance during the primary instance's maintenance window.
- A read pool receives maintenance before its primary instance, similar to read replicas.
- In addition to operations that aren't supported on read replicas, the following operations aren't supported on read pools: Enable and disable replication Promote replica Restart Import Export Failover Re-encrypt Clone SSL/TLS certificates with shared CA or customer-managed CA can't be used with a read pool.
