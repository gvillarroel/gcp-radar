Evidence snippets:
- REST Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: PROJECT ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance INSTANCE NAME : the name of your Cloud SQL instance Note: By setting the value of the connectorEnforcement parameter to REQUIRED , all connections must use the Cloud SQL Language Connectors, including the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy and the Java, Python, Go, and Node.js connectors.
- PRIVATE IP === 'true' ? 'PRIVATE' : 'PUBLIC' ; // connectWithConnector initializes a connection pool for a Cloud SQL instance // of MySQL using the Cloud SQL Node.js Connector. const connectWithConnector = async config = > { // Note: Saving credentials in environment variables is convenient, but not // secure - consider a more secure solution such as // Cloud Secret Manager (https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) to help // keep secrets safe. const connector = new Connector (); const clientOpts = await connector . getOptions ({ instanceConnectionName : process . env .
- Errorf ( "sql.Open: %w" , err ) } return dbPool , nil } Node.js For detailed instructions on using the library, see Usage . const mysql = require ( 'mysql2/promise' ); const { Connector } = require ( '@google-cloud/cloud-sql-connector' ); // In case the PRIVATE IP environment variable is defined then we set // the ipType=PRIVATE for the new connector instance, otherwise defaults // to public ip type. const getIpType = () = > process . env .
- This page discusses the following Cloud SQL Connectors: The Cloud SQL Java Connector The Cloud SQL Python Connector (Open in Colab) The Cloud SQL Go Connector The Cloud SQL Node.js Connector Benefits Using a Cloud SQL connector provides the following benefits: IAM authorization: Uses IAM permissions to control who or what can connect to your Cloud SQL instances.
