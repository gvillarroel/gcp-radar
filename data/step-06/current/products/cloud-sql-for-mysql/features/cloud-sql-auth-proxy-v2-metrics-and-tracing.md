- For information about the implementation of MySQL 8.0 on Cloud SQL, see the following topics: MySQL 8.0 authentication Differences between Cloud SQL and standard MySQL functionality Unsupported Cloud SQL feature in MySQL 8.0 for Cloud SQL To get started using MySQL 8.0 on Cloud SQL, see Creating instances .
- For users of the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy : If the Cloud SQL instance to which you're connecting is using shared certificate authority (CA) for its serverCaMode setting, then on the client side, you must use Cloud SQL Auth Proxy version 2.13.0 or later.
- Shared CA : with this option, the Cloud SQL instance uses a CA hierarchy consisting of a root CA and subordinate server CAs managed by Cloud SQL and hosted on Google Cloud Certificate Authority Service (CA Service).
