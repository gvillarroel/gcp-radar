Evidence snippets:
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID ", "status": "PENDING", "user": USER , "insertTime": "2025-05-13T20:44:23.064Z", "operationType": "UPDATE", "targetId": " INSTANCE ID ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "targetProject": " PROJECT ID "," } Test connectivity To test inbound connectivity to a Cloud SQL instance with Private Service Connect enabled, set the IP address of the Private Service Connect endpoint to be the destination IP address. gcloud To create a connectivity test for a Cloud SQL instance with Private Service Connect enabled, use the gcloud network-management connectivity-tests create command: gcloud network-management connectivity-tests create CONNECTIVITY TEST NAME \ --source-instance = SOURCE INSTANCE \ --destination-cloud-sql-instance = DESTINATION CLOUD SQL INSTANCE \ --destination-network = DESTINATION NETWORK \ --destination-port = DESTINATION PORT \ --protocol = tcp Make the following replacements: CONNECTIVITY TEST NAME : the name of the connectivity test.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE NAME ", "status": "RUNNING", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2020-01-16T02:32:12.281Z", "startTime": "2023-06-14T18:48:35.499Z", "operationType": "CREATE", "name": " OPERATION ID ", "targetId": " INSTANCE NAME ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "targetProject": " PROJECT ID " } Retrieve the endpoint By retrieving the internal IP address, which is the Private Service Connect endpoint for an instance, you can use this endpoint to connect to the instance . gcloud To view information about an instance, including the IP address that's the Private Service Connect endpoint for the instance, use the gcloud sql instances describe command: gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE NAME \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --format = 'json(settings.ipConfiguration.pscConfig.pscAutoConnections)' Make the following replacements: INSTANCE NAME : the name of the Cloud SQL instance.
- Make the following replacements: INSTANCE NAME : the name of the Cloud SQL instance to which Private Service Connect endpoints in VPC networks can connect PROJECT ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance The following example shows a sample output for this command: gcloud sql instances describe myinstance \ --project = 12345 ... pscServiceAttachmentLink: projects/45678/regions/myregion/serviceAttachments/myserviceattachment REST Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: PROJECT ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance INSTANCE NAME : the name of the instance HTTP method and URL: GET https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE NAME To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://networkmanagement.googleapis.com/v1beta/projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/global/connectivityTests?testId= CONNECTIVITY TEST NAME " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/global/operations/operation- OPERATION ID ", "metadata": { "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.networkmanagement.v1.OperationMetadata", "createTime": "2024-05-23T16:43:49.313981473Z", "target": "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/global/connectivityTests/ CONNECTIVITY TEST NAME ", "verb": "create", "cancelRequested": false, "apiVersion": "v1" }, "done": false } Note: In addition to testing connectivity, you can restrict connectivity to Private Service Connect endpoints from service consumers in a VPC network.
