Evidence snippets:
- Instance configuration for Cloud SQL IAM database authentication You can enable IAM database authentication on an instance using the cloudsql iam authentication flag.
- IAM references for Cloud SQL Required permissions for common tasks in the Google Cloud console Required permissions for gcloud sql commands Required permissions for Cloud SQL Admin API methods Predefined Cloud SQL IAM roles Permissions and their roles Custom roles IAM authentication concepts When using IAM authentication, permission to access a resource (a Cloud SQL instance) isn't granted directly to the end user.
- Context-aware access and IAM database authentication If you're using context-aware access in your IAM configuration, then you can't use a Cloud SQL connector such as the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or one of the Cloud SQL Language Connectors with IAM database authentication.
- Cloud SQL IAM database authentication for different instance scenarios Read replicas IAM database authentication is not enabled in a read replica automatically, even when it is enabled on the primary instance.
