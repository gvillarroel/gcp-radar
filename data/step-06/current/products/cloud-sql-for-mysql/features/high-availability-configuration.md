Evidence snippets:
- Configure the root user: gcloud sql users set-password root --host = % \ --instance = PRIMARY INSTANCE NAME \ --password = PASSWORD Terraform To create an instance with high availability, use a Terraform resource . resource "google sql database instance" "mysql instance ha" { name = "mysql-instance-ha" region = "asia-northeast1" database version = "MYSQL 8 0" settings { tier = "db-f1-micro" availability type = "REGIONAL" backup configuration { enabled = true binary log enabled = true start time = "20:55" } } set deletion protection to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by use of Terraform whereas deletion protection enabled flag protects this instance at the GCP level. deletion protection = false } Apply the changes To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.
- Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: PROJECT ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance INSTANCE NAME : the name of the primary or read replica instance that you're configuring for high availability START TIME : the time (in hours and minutes) HTTP method and URL: PATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE NAME Request JSON body: { "settings": { "backupConfiguration": { "startTime": " START TIME ", "enabled": true, "binaryLogEnabled": true } } } To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .

- If you have an existing MySQL instance that uses the legacy high availability configuration, you can update your configuration to use the current version.
