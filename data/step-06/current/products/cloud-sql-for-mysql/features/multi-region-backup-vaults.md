Evidence snippets:
- The following table provides an overview of the key features available with each backup option: Features Standard backups Enhanced backups Centralized backup management across projects - ✔ Backup vault - ✔ Automated backup schedule Daily Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly On-demand backups ✔ ✔ Multi-region backups ✔ ✔ Final backup in instance deletion ✔ ✔ Backup retention period 1 year 10 years Retain all backups on instance deletion ✔ ✔ Retain backups on project deletion - ✔ Enforced retention with retention lock - ✔ Point-in-time recovery using logs ✔ ✔ Point-in-time recovery after instance deletion ✔ ✔ Cross-region backup and restore ✔ - CMEK support ✔ - For detailed information about these backup options, see Standard backups and Enhanced backups .
- Limitations The following limitations apply when using enhanced backups: The Backup vault and your Cloud SQL instance must be in the same region or compatible with your instance's location for multi-region Backup vault.
- A backup vault stores backups in a single region or a multi-region as long as the selected location is compatible with your instance's location .
- In a multi-region configuration, it's recommended that backups be in the same region as the instance to minimize latency and avoid potential backup failures due to organization policies, or location-based limitations.

Evidence snippets:
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://backupdr.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location /backupPlanAssociations" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: Response { "kind": "operation", "state": "CREATING", "user": "user@example.com", "updateTime": "2020-01-21T22:43:37.981Z", "operationType": "backupPlanAssociations.create", "name": " operation-id ", "dataSource": "projects/ project-id /locations/ location /backupVaults/ backup-vault-name /dataSources/ data-source-name " } Manage enhanced backups After you instance is enabled for enhanced backups and a backup plan is associated with the instance, you can perform an on-demand backup , view all the backups in the backup vault , or change the associated backup plan .
- Execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers -Uri "https://backupdr.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location /backupVaults/ backup-vault-id /dataSources/ data-source-id /backups" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: Response { "backups": [ { "name": " backup-name ", "state": "ACTIVE", "backupType": "ON DEMAND", "createTime": "", "expireTime": "", "CloudSqlInstanceBackupProperties": { "databaseInstalledVersion": " database-installed-version ", "finalBackup": "TRUE", "sourceInstance": " instance-name ", "instanceTier": "db-custom-1-3840" } }, { ... } ] } Disable enhanced backups You can disable enhanced backups by switching your Cloud SQL instance back to the standard backups option.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://backupdr.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /locations/ location /dataSourceReferences:fetchForResourceType?filter=dataSourceGcpResourceInfo.gcp resourcename="projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: Response { "name": "projects/ project-id /locations/ location /dataSourceReferences/ dataSourceId " "dataSourceBackupConfigState": "ACTIVE", "dataSourceBackupCount": "1", "dataSourceBackupConfigInfo": { "lastBackupState: "SUCCEEDED", "lastSuccessfulBackupConsistencyTime": "2024-09-19T18:00:00Z" }, "dataSourceGcpResourceInfo": { "gcpResourceName": "projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id ", "type": "sqladmin.googleapis.com/Instance", "location": " location " "cloudSqlInstanceProperties": { "name": "projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id " } } } List the instance's backups To list your the backups for your instance using the data source ID, use the backupVaults.dataSources.backups method in the Backup and DR API .
- Before you begin Before you can manage enhanced backups for your Cloud SQL instances, you must do the following: Enable the Backup and DR API Confirm you have the required permissions Enable the Backup and DR API To use enhanced backups with your Cloud SQL instances, you must first enable the Backup and DR API: Enable the Backup and DR API Required permissions The following permissions are required to configure enhanced backups for your Cloud SQL instances: backupdr.backupPlans.list backupdr.backupPlanAssociations.createForCloudSqlInstance backupdr.backupPlanAssociations.fetchForCloudSqlInstance backupdr.backupPlanAssociations.list backupdr.backupPlanAssociations.getForCloudSqlInstance backupdr.backupPlanAssociations.triggerBackupForCloudSqlInstance backupdr.backupPlanAssociations.deleteForCloudSqlInstance backupdr.backupPlans.useForCloudSqlInstance backupdr.bvdataSources.get backupdr.bvdataSources.list For more information about these permissions, see Backup and DR roles and permissions .

- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE

Evidence snippets:
- In the backups list, the Location column lists the type of location (multi-region or region) and the specific multi-region or region for each backup. gcloud For reference information, see gcloud sql instances describe .
- If not required, use the default multi-region backup location.
- Execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id /backupRuns" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: Response { "kind": "sql#backupRun", "status": "SUCCESSFUL", "enqueuedTime": "2020-01-21T11:25:33.818Z", "id": " backup-id ", "startTime": "2020-01-21T11:25:33.858Z", "endTime": "2020-01-21T11:26:18.663Z", "type": "AUTOMATED", "windowStartTime": "2020-01-21T10:00:00.479Z", "instance": " instance-id ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id /backupRuns/ backup-id ", "location": "us" } View a list of backups during an outage When an instance is in a region that is having an outage, you can only view backups for that instance using a wildcard ( - ) with the backupRuns.list API.
- Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: region : The project region backup-region : The backup region project-id : The project ID instance-id : The instance ID HTTP method and URL: PATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id Request JSON body: { "region": " region " "settings": { "backupConfiguration": { "location": " backup-region ", "enabled": true, } } } To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
