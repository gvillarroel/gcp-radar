- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 222
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If the Cloud SQL instance to which you're connecting is using customer-managed CA for its serverCaMode setting, then on the client side, you must use Cloud SQL Auth Proxy version 2.14.3 or later.
- You can update existing instances that use the per-instance CA option ( GOOGLE MANAGED INTERNAL CA ) to use the shared CA option ( GOOGLE MANAGED CAS CA ) or the customer-managed CA option ( CUSTOMER MANAGED CAS CA ).
- March 31, 2025 Feature Cloud SQL now supports Managed Connection Pooling (MCP) in Preview , which lets you scale your workloads by optimizing resource utilization for your Cloud SQL instances using pooling.
- February 05, 2025 Feature You can now configure customer-managed CA ( CUSTOMER MANAGED CAS CA ) as the server certificate authority (CA) mode when you create a Cloud SQL instance.

- If you must use the requireSsl flag for backward compatibility, then only the following value pairs are valid: For PostgreSQL and MySQL: sslMode=ALLOW UNENCRYPTED AND ENCRYPTED and requireSsl=false sslMode=ENCRYPTED ONLY and requireSsl=false sslMode=TRUSTED CLIENT CERTIFICATE REQUIRED and requireSsl=true For SQL Server: sslMode=ALLOW UNENCRYPTED AND ENCRYPTED and requireSsl=false sslMode=ENCRYPTED ONLY and requireSsl=true The value of sslMode has priority over the value of requireSsl .
- Custom Subject Alternative Name(SAN)s for a Cloud SQL instance. pscConfig object ( PscConfig ) PSC settings for this instance. serverCaMode enum ( CaMode ) Specify what type of CA is used for the server certificate. serverCaPool string Optional.
