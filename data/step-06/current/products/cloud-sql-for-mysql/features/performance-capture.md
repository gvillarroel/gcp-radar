# Performance capture

Product: Cloud SQL for MySQL
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

This feature captures diagnostic snapshots of database state when configurable performance thresholds are reached.

## Extended Definition

This feature captures diagnostic snapshots of database state when configurable performance thresholds are reached.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 140
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If a threshold is reached, then performance capture takes snapshots of the database state, including in-flight transactions, InnoDB status, and, in the case of replication lag, detailed replication status.
- The functions include (and are not limited to) the following: cdc.fn cdc get all changes <capture instance> Sys.fn cdc get max lsn To turn on this feature for a database, run this command: exec msdb .[ dbo ].[ gcloudsql cdc enable db ] 'demo' To turn off this feature for a database, run this command: exec msdb.[dbo].[gcloudsql cdc disable db] 'demo' Feature Cloud SQL for SQL Server enables you to perform common operations on a tempdb database .
- Performance capture outputs the snapshots in a log format so you can review the state of the instance when the problem occurred.
- Use this flag when you're deciding whether to run a VACUUM . autovacuum vacuum insert threshold : specify the minimum number of inserted records or rows (tuples) that you need to run a VACUUM in any database table. effective io concurrency : set the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that can run simultaneously. hash mem multiplier : compute the maximum amount of memory that hash-based operations can use. logical decoding work mem : specify the maximum amount of memory that logical decoding can use before some of the decoded changes are written to a local disk. maintenance io concurrency : set the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that can run simultaneously for maintenance work that's done for client sessions. vacuum failsafe age : specify the maximum age (in transactions) that a database table's pg class.relfrozenxid field can attain before a VACUUM takes extraordinary measures to avoid a system-wide wraparound failure for transaction IDs. vacuum multixact failsafe age : specify the maximum age (in multiple transactions) that a database table's pg class.relminmxid field can attain before a VACUUM takes extraordinary measures to avoid a system-wide wraparound failure for multiple transaction IDs.

- Performance capture outputs the snapshots in a log format so you can review the state of the instance when the problem occurred.
- It provides self-service, intuitive monitoring, and diagnostic information that goes beyond detection to help you to identify the root cause of performance problems.
- Offloading the export operation allows databases on the primary instance to continue to serve queries and perform other operations at the usual performance rate.
