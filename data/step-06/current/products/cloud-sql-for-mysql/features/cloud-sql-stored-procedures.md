- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-3`
- Final score: 92
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- DROP DATABASE [ database name ]; Note: If the database's directory contains any files not directly used by the database, the DROP DATABASE command will generate errors indicating that the database directory couldn't be deleted, such as: Error dropping database (can't rmdir './ database name ', errno: 39) Error dropping database (can't rmdir './ database name ', errno: 17) Examples of such files are #sql- files created from interrupted ALTER TABLE operations in MySQL 5.6 and MySQL 5.7.
- Examples of such files are #sql- files created from interrupted ALTER TABLE operations in MySQL 5.6 and MySQL 5.7. gcloud For reference information, see gcloud sql databases delete . gcloud sql databases delete DATABASE NAME \ --instance = INSTANCE NAME Note: Deleting a database removes all files in the database's directory, including any files not directly used by the database.

Evidence snippets:
- From a command line, run mysqldump : mysqldump --databases DATABASE NAME -h INSTANCE IP -u USERNAME -p \ --hex-blob --single-transaction --set-gtid-purged = OFF \ --default-character-set = utf8mb4 > SQL FILE .sql Note: To export stored procedures from a Cloud SQL instance, include the --routines flag.
- If binary logging is enabled and you want to export triggers and stored procedures, you must also set the log bin trust function creators flag in your MySQL database.
- To export triggers and/or stored procedures, use the mysqldump tool.
- Otherwise, remove it from the following command. gcloud sql export sql INSTANCE NAME gs:// BUCKET NAME /sqldumpfile.gz \ --database= DATABASE NAME \ --offload The export sql command does not contain triggers or stored procedures, but does contain views.
