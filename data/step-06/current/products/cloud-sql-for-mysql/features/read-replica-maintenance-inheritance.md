Product: Cloud SQL for MySQL
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Evidence snippets:
- Create the new replica by specifying your primary replica as the primary instance using the --master-instance-name flag: gcloud sql instances create REPLICA NAME \ --master-instance-name = PARENT REPLICA NAME \ Replace the following: REPLICA NAME : the unique ID for the replica that you are creating PARENT REPLICA NAME : the name of the parent replica After you create the cascading replica, you can see that the changes made to the primary instance are replicated through all the replicas in the cascading replicas chain. curl If you are using MySQL version 5.7 or later, enable binary logging: To enable binary logging, save the following JSON in a file named request.JSON, then invoke the curl command to enable binary logging. { "settings" : { "backupConfiguration" : { "enabled" : false, "binaryLogEnabled" : true } } } To create a replica under the parent replica, edit the following JSON code sample, and save it to a file called request.json : { "masterInstanceName" : " PARENT REPLICA NAME " , "project" : " PROJECT ID " , "name" : " REPLICA NAME " , "region" : " REPLICA REGION " , "settings" : { "tier" : " MACHINE TYPE " , } } Run the following command: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer " $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -d @request.json "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances" Troubleshoot Issue Troubleshooting Read replica didn't start replicating on creation.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method PATCH -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ REPLICA INSTANCE NAME ", "status": "PENDING", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2020-01-16T02:32:12.281Z", "operationType": "CREATE REPLICA", "name": " OPERATION ID ", "targetId": " REPLICA INSTANCE NAME ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "targetProject": " PROJECT ID " } Configure read replicas for IAM database authentication Read replicas do not have the cloudsql iam authentication flag enabled automatically when it is enabled on the primary instance.
- Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: PROJECT ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance INSTANCE NAME : the name of the primary or read replica instance that you're configuring for high availability START TIME : the time (in hours and minutes) HTTP method and URL: PATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE NAME Request JSON body: { "settings": { "backupConfiguration": { "startTime": " START TIME ", "enabled": true, "binaryLogEnabled": true } } } To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .

### About read pools \_|\_ Cloud SQL for MySQL \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/about-read-pools](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/about-read-pools)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-3`
- Final score: 185
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Like read replicas, read pools receive maintenance during the primary instance's maintenance window.
- A read pool receives maintenance before its primary instance, similar to read replicas.
- In addition to operations that aren't supported on read replicas, the following operations aren't supported on read pools: Enable and disable replication Promote replica Restart Import Export Failover Re-encrypt Clone SSL/TLS certificates with shared CA or customer-managed CA can't be used with a read pool.
- The following types of updates aren't supported: While read pools still receive Cloud SQL maintenance updates, you can't update your read pool to a new major or minor database version.

### About high availability \_|\_ Cloud SQL for MySQL \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/high-availability](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/high-availability)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 169
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- When failover occurs, any existing connections to the primary instance and read replicas are closed, and it will take approximately 60 seconds for connections to the primary instance to be reestablished.
- Note: If failover occurs, read replicas outside of the outage zone don't change zones; they continue to serve data even if they are in a different zone than the primary instance.
- If read replicas are not located in a zone that is undergoing an outage, they connect to the standby instance when it becomes the primary instance.
- You should also add business logic in the client application to send reads to the primary instance when read replicas are unavailable.
