Evidence snippets:
- MySQL PostgreSQL SQL Server You can use point-in-time-recovery (PITR) to restore your primary Cloud SQL instances whether the instance is live, or is deleted.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ project-id /instances/ source-instance-id /clone" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: Response { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ project-id /instances/ target-instance-id ", "status": "PENDING", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2020-01-21T22:43:37.981Z", "operationType": "CREATE", "name": " operation-id ", "targetId": " target-instance-id ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ project-id /operations/ operation-id ", "targetProject": " project-id " } Perform a PITR using the backup vault If your Cloud SQL instance is enabled to use enhanced backups , then you can perform point-in-time-recovery for your instance using the backup vault.
