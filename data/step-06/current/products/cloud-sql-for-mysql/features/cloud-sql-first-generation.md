(Deprecated) This property was applicable only to First Generation instances. serviceAccountEmailAddress string The service account email address assigned to the instance.\This property is read-only. onPremisesConfiguration object ( OnPremisesConfiguration ) Configuration specific to on-premises instances. replicaConfiguration object ( ReplicaConfiguration ) Configuration specific to failover replicas and read replicas. backendType enum ( SqlBackendType ) The backend type.
- This can be either ASYNCHRONOUS or SYNCHRONOUS . (Deprecated) This property was only applicable to First Generation instances. storageAutoResizeLimit string ( Int64Value format) The maximum size to which storage capacity can be automatically increased.
- The App Engine app IDs that can access this instance. (Deprecated) Applied to First Generation instances only. tier string The tier (or machine type) for this instance, for example db-custom-1-3840 .

- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- There can be many causes because authorization occurs at many levels: At the database level, the database user must exist and its password match At the project level, the user might not have the correct IAM permissions, including the serviceusage.services.use or cloudsql.instances.connect permissions.
- Find the process that locked the table and stop it: Diagnose with: sql> show processlist; The first item in the list might be the one holding the lock, which the following items are waiting on.
- If you want to drop the user login associated with a database owner that's no longer active, you must first assign a new database owner .
- Some operations may require you to drop the foreign key constraint first, apply the change, then add the foreign key back.

Evidence snippets:
- Using this flag when you create an instance before that project has been fully upgraded to the new network architecture can lead to IP address overconsumption or a failure to create instances if there aren't sufficient IP addresses remaining in the allocated IP range.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method PUT -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id /users?host=%25&name=root" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id ", "status": "DONE", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2019-09-26T14:32:30.592Z", "startTime": "2019-09-26T14:32:30.594Z", "endTime": "2019-09-26T14:32:33.518Z", "operationType": "UPDATE USER", "name": " operation-id ", "targetId": " instance-id ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /operations/ operation-id ", "targetProject": " project-id " } Retrieve the IPv4 address Retrieve the automatically assigned IPv4 address for the new instance: Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: project-id : your project ID instance-id : instance ID created in prior step HTTP method and URL: GET https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
