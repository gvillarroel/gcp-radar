Evidence snippets:
- Enable retained backups after instance deletion Determines whether automated and on-demand backups are retained after an instance is deleted.
- Set the password for the "root@%" MySQL user: gcloud sql users set-password root \ --host = % \ --instance INSTANCE NAME \ --password PASSWORD Terraform To create an instance, use a Terraform resource . resource "google sql database instance" "mysql pvp instance name" { name = "mysql-pvp-instance-name" region = "asia-northeast1" database version = "MYSQL 8 0" root password = "abcABC123!" settings { tier = "db-f1-micro" password validation policy { min length = 6 complexity = "COMPLEXITY DEFAULT" reuse interval = 2 disallow username substring = true enable password policy = true } } set deletion protection to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by use of Terraform whereas deletion protection enabled flag protects this instance at the GCP level. deletion protection = false } Apply the changes To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.
- Delete the changes To delete your changes, do the following: To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the deletion protection argument to false . deletion protection = "false" Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes at the prompt: terraform apply Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes at the prompt: terraform destroy REST v1 Create the instance This example creates an instance.
- Automatic backups and high availability High availability --availability-type For a highly-available instance, set to REGIONAL .

- However, for on-demand or automated backups that are retained after instance deletion, you can only update the description of for these backups.
- MySQL PostgreSQL SQL Server You can manage backups after an instance is deleted if you elected to retain backups after instance deletion , or took a final backup prior to deleting your instance.

Evidence snippets:
- For standard backups, since instance names can be used after an instance is deleted in Cloud SQL, retained backups are stored in your Google Cloud project with a field called instance deletion time .
- Retain backups after instance deletion Retained backups are backups that are retained by Cloud SQL after an instance is deleted.
- Additionally, you can also retain backups after your instance is deleted to allow you to restore the instance after deletion.
- Retained backups are different from final backups , which are the last backups taken at time of instance deletion.
