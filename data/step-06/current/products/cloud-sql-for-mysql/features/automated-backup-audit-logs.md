- Backup request types You can take on-demand, automated, or final backups for your Cloud SQL instances.
- Backup options Cloud SQL offers two backup service options to manage your instance's backups: Enhanced backups : backups are managed and stored in a centralized backup management project that leverages the Backup and DR Service, and provides enforced retention, granular scheduling, and monitoring.
- Relevant log files include: cloudsql.googlapis.com/mysql-general.log cloudsql.googleapis.com/mysql.err If Cloud Audit Logs is enabled and you have the required permissions to view them, cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity may also be available.
- For standard backups, since instance names can be used after an instance is deleted in Cloud SQL, retained backups are stored in your Google Cloud project with a field called instance deletion time .
