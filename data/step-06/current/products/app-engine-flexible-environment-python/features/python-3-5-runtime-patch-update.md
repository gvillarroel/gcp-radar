Evidence snippets:
- Issues arising from the use of an unsupported runtime will not be eligible for technical support We strongly encourage you to upgrade your application to a supported runtime version as soon as it becomes available to continue receiving security updates and being eligible for technical support.
- To continue receiving security updates, we strongly encourage you to upgrade your application to a supported runtime version as soon as it becomes available.
- End of support Important: Google will no longer apply security updates or patches to components of the runtime environment that have reached end of support.
- When runtime components reach the end of support date: Google will no longer apply security updates or patches to components of the runtime environment.

- To use a supported .NET version, you must: Update your project file with the .NET version you want to use. <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web"> <PropertyGroup> <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework> <Nullable>enable</Nullable> <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> </PropertyGroup> <ItemGroup> <None Update="app.yaml"> <CopyToPublishDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToPublishDirectory> </None> </ItemGroup> </Project> Install gcloud CLI version 420.0.0 or later .
- To deploy your .NET app, run the following commands from the root directory where your app resides: dotnet restore dotnet publish -c Release gcloud app deploy Support for other .NET runtimes If you need to use a .NET version that isn't supported , you can create a custom runtime and select a valid base image with the .NET version you need.
- For example, the app.yaml file looks as follows when specifying .NET 10 on Ubuntu 24: runtime : aspnetcore env : flex runtime config : runtime version : "10" operating system : "ubuntu24" Previous runtime versions Warning: .NET version 3 and earlier have reached end of support.
