- Recommended role for application deployment For an account that is responsible only for deploying new versions of an app, we recommend that you grant the following roles: App Engine Deployer role ( roles/appengine.deployer ) Service Account User role ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) The Service Account User role enables the account to impersonate the default App Engine service account during the deployment process.
