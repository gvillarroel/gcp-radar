- Unsupported HTTP requests The following features are not supported by App Engine flexible environment: HTTP/2 traffic to the backend service.
- However, this is bound by the following restrictions: App Engine reserves automatic scaling capacity for applications with low latency, where the application responds to requests in less than one second.

Evidence snippets:
- Service IP range for requests sent to the App Engine standard environment IP range for requests sent to the App Engine flexible environment App Engine Cron 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32 Compute Engine instances with external IP addresses External IP address of the instance External IP address of the instance Compute Engine instances without an external IP address 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Compute Engine instances without an external IP address using Cloud NAT for outbound connections 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Cloud Scheduler jobs using App Engine HTTP and App Engine tasks in Cloud Tasks (including App Engine Task Queues) 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.2/32 Cloud Storage or Blobstore 0.1.0.30/32 Not applicable URL Fetch 0.1.0.40/32 0.1.0.40/32 Warming requests 0.1.0.3/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny Not applicable Depending on your use case, these additional instructions might apply when configuring App Engine firewall rules: Requests from newly created or updated App Engine Cron jobs sent to either the App Engine standard or flexible environment come from 0.1.0.2 .
- App Engine flexible example Your app running in the flexible environment has two services: frontend service and backend service , and has a firewall configured to deny traffic by default. frontend service uses Cloud Tasks with App Engine HTTP to send messages to backend service .
- The IP range you use depends on whether the incoming requests are delivered to a version that runs on the App Engine standard environment or flexible environment.
- If there are VPC-based firewall rules (such as VPC firewall rules or hierarchical firewall policies ) configured in your network environment, both VPC-level firewalls and App Engine firewalls need to allow an incoming request's IP range for your App Engine app to receive it.
