# Updated health checks deployment behavior

Product: App Engine flexible environment Python
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

When updated health checks are enabled, deployments fail if the application does not reach a ready state.

## Extended Definition

When updated health checks are enabled, deployments fail if the application does not reach a ready state.

## Evidence Summary

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-2`
- Final score: 128
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- If you need to extend the default behavior of split health checks to your application, you can customize the app.yaml file to configure two types of health checks: Liveness checks detect that a VM instance and its container are running.
- Learn more about split health check behaviors in the Migrating to Split Health Checks guide.
- By default, these health checks are enabled and are known as split health checks .
- App Engine continues to send health check requests and restarts the instance if an unhealthy instance continues to fail to respond to a predetermined number of consecutive health checks.

Evidence snippets:
- Service IP range for requests sent to the App Engine standard environment IP range for requests sent to the App Engine flexible environment App Engine Cron 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32 Compute Engine instances with external IP addresses External IP address of the instance External IP address of the instance Compute Engine instances without an external IP address 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Compute Engine instances without an external IP address using Cloud NAT for outbound connections 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Cloud Scheduler jobs using App Engine HTTP and App Engine tasks in Cloud Tasks (including App Engine Task Queues) 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.2/32 Cloud Storage or Blobstore 0.1.0.30/32 Not applicable URL Fetch 0.1.0.40/32 0.1.0.40/32 Warming requests 0.1.0.3/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny Not applicable Depending on your use case, these additional instructions might apply when configuring App Engine firewall rules: Requests from newly created or updated App Engine Cron jobs sent to either the App Engine standard or flexible environment come from 0.1.0.2 .
- Direction of traffic : Ingress Action on match : Allow Source IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 and 130.211.0.0/22 Protocols and ports : tcp : 8443 (for legacy health checks) or 10402 (for split health checks) Priority : 1000 Preventing access to cached content The App Engine firewall sits behind mechanisms that cache content, for example web proxies and browsers.
- If your App Engine flexible environment app is not configured to use Shared VPC , the App Engine flexible environment creates up to two hidden VPC firewall rules, depending on whether your app uses split health checks (default) or legacy health checks.

Evidence snippets:
- Session affinity is set at the version level of your application and can be enabled or disabled on deployment.
- For more information about health checks and their customization options, see Split health checks .
- If the target instance fails health checks, App Engine moves the session to a healthy instance.
