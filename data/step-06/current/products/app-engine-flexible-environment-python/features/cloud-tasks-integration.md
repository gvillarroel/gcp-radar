# Cloud Tasks integration

Product: App Engine flexible environment Python
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

App Engine applications can use Cloud Tasks to run asynchronous work outside user requests.

## Extended Definition

App Engine applications can use Cloud Tasks to run asynchronous work outside user requests.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

Evidence snippets:
- However, this is bound by the following restrictions: App Engine reserves automatic scaling capacity for applications with low latency, where the application responds to requests in less than one second.
- When deploying to Google App Engine, a webserver process such as Gunicorn will serve the app. app . run ( host = "127.0.0.1" , port = 8080 , debug = True ) Quotas and limits App Engine automatically allocates resources to your application as traffic increases.

- Applications that are heavily CPU-bound may also incur some additional latency in order to efficiently share resources with other applications on the same servers.
