Evidence snippets:
- To move from your own SSL certificates to Google-managed SSL certificates, or to add managed SSL certificates to an existing app with a custom domain, update your domain mapping: In the Google Cloud console, go to App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains : Go to Custom Domains Select the domain you want to secure, and click Enable managed security .
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
- After mapping a custom domain to your application and updating your DNS records , App Engine provisions a managed SSL certificate, renews the certificate, and revokes it when you remove the custom domain from your application.
- Disable managed SSL certificates To disable managed SSL certificates: In the Google Cloud console, go to App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains : Go to Custom Domains Select the domain and click Disable managed security .

- If you encounter the limit, App Engine keeps trying to issue managed certificates until all requests have been fulfilled.
- For more information, see the following pages: Using Google-managed SSL certificates Using self-managed SSL certificates SSL policies Note the following limitation: We recommend that you use ingress controls so that your app only receives requests sent from the load balancer (and the VPC if you use it).
- Otherwise, users can use your app's App Engine URL to bypass the load balancer, Cloud Armor security policies, SSL certificates, and private keys that are passed through the load balancer.
