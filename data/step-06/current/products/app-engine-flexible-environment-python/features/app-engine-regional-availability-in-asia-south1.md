### "Quickstart: Create a .NET app in the App Engine flexible environment \_\

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-2`
- Final score: 47
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- App Engine locations App Engine is regional , which means the infrastructure that runs your apps is located in a specific region, and Google manages it so that it is available redundantly across all of the zones within that region .
- You can generally select the region nearest to your app's users, but you should consider the locations where App Engine is available as well as the locations of the other Google Cloud products and services that your app uses.
- By default, App Engine uses the latest available LTS .NET version if you don't specify a runtime version in your app.yaml file.
- To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command: gcloud init Required roles To get the permissions that you need to complete this quickstart, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: App Engine Admin ( roles/appengine.appAdmin ) on the project Cloud Build Editor ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor ) on the project Storage Object Admin ( roles/storage.objectAdmin ) on the project Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) on the project Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) on the service account Ask your administrator to grant the following roles for the App Engine default service account: Artifact Registry Reader ( roles/artifactregistry.reader ) on the project Cloud Build Service Account ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder ) on the project Storage Object Viewer ( roles/storage.objectViewer ) on the project For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 46
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- The regions are as follows: us-west2 us-east4 northamerica-northeast1 southamerica-east1 europe-west2 europe-west3 asia-south1 asia-northeast1 australia-southeast1 App Engine custom domains use a pool of shared IP addresses for all applications.
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
- Updating DNS records at your domain registrar Note: If you have a custom domain set up for your App Engine app and want to move it to a different Google Cloud project, you do not need to update your custom domain DNS records as these will remain fixed for the domain when you switch projects.
- Deleting custom domains from your app In order to delete a custom domain mapping from your app, your account must have the App Engine Admin role ( roles/appengine.appAdmin ) or a custom role that contains the appengine.applications.update permission.
