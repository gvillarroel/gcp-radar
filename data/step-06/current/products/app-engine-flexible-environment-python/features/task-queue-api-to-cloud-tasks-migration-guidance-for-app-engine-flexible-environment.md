Evidence snippets:
- Service IP range for requests sent to the App Engine standard environment IP range for requests sent to the App Engine flexible environment App Engine Cron 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32 Compute Engine instances with external IP addresses External IP address of the instance External IP address of the instance Compute Engine instances without an external IP address 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Compute Engine instances without an external IP address using Cloud NAT for outbound connections 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Cloud Scheduler jobs using App Engine HTTP and App Engine tasks in Cloud Tasks (including App Engine Task Queues) 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.2/32 Cloud Storage or Blobstore 0.1.0.30/32 Not applicable URL Fetch 0.1.0.40/32 0.1.0.40/32 Warming requests 0.1.0.3/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny Not applicable Depending on your use case, these additional instructions might apply when configuring App Engine firewall rules: Requests from newly created or updated App Engine Cron jobs sent to either the App Engine standard or flexible environment come from 0.1.0.2 .
- App Engine flexible example Your app running in the flexible environment has two services: frontend service and backend service , and has a firewall configured to deny traffic by default. frontend service uses Cloud Tasks with App Engine HTTP to send messages to backend service .
- App Engine standard example Your app running in the standard environment has two services: frontend service and backend service . frontend service uses Cloud Tasks with App Engine HTTP to send messages to backend service .
- Traffic from internal sources such as Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs) and Cloud Tasks.

- Separation of deployment and traffic routing duties Many organizations prefer to separate the task of deploying an application version from the task of ramping up traffic to the newly created version, and to have these tasks done by different job functions.
