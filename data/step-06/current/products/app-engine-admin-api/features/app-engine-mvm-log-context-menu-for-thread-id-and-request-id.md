- If warmup requests are enabled for your application, App Engine attempts to detect when your application needs a new instance and initiates a warmup request to initialize a new instance.
- Enabling warmup requests Warmup requests are used by the App Engine scheduler, which controls the auto scaling of instances based on user-supplied configuration.
- When deploying to Google App Engine, a webserver process such as Gunicorn will serve the app.
