- Log name Cloud Audit Logs log names include resource identifiers indicating the Google Cloud project or other Google Cloud entity that owns the audit logs, and whether the log contains Admin Activity, Data Access, Policy Denied, or System Event audit logging data.
- When deciding which Logging-specific permissions and roles apply to your use case, consider the following: The Logs Viewer role ( roles/logging.viewer ) gives you read-only access to Admin Activity, Policy Denied, and System Event audit logs.

- Select roles that grant access to App Engine features .
- Select roles that grant access to App Engine features .
- Client () Make an authenticated API request buckets = list ( storage client . list buckets ()) print ( buckets ) Ruby project id = "Your Google Cloud project ID" require "google/cloud/storage" If you don't specify credentials when constructing the client, the client library will look for credentials in the environment. storage = Google :: Cloud :: Storage . new project : project id Make an authenticated API request storage . buckets . each do bucket puts bucket . name end By default, the app's environment contains credentials from the default App Engine service account .
