- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- Create a connector using an existing subnet : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create CONNECTOR NAME \ --region REGION \ --subnet SUBNET NAME \ --subnet-project HOST PROJECT ID \ --min-instances MIN \ --max-instances MAX \ --machine-type MACHINE TYPE Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : a name for your connector, matching Compute Engine naming conventions , with the additional requirements that the name must be less than 21 characters long, and that hyphens (-) count as two characters.
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.

Evidence snippets:
- REGION ID .r.appspot.com To target specific resources in your App Engine app, use the -dot- syntax to separate each resource you want to target, for example: https:// VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT ID .
- For apps created after February 2020, REGION ID .r is included in App Engine URLs.
- Block abusive IP addresses While Google Cloud has many mechanisms in place to prevent attacks, you can use the App Engine firewall to block traffic to your app from IP addresses that present malicious intent or shield your app from denial of service attacks and similar forms of abuse.
- Security scanner The Google Cloud Web Security Scanner discovers vulnerabilities by crawling your App Engine app, following all that links within the scope of your starting URLs, and attempting to exercise as many user inputs and event handlers as possible.
