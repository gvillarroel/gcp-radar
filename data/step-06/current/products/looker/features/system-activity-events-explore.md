Evidence snippets:
- PDT Event Log Explore Looker includes a prebuilt model named system activity that allows exploration of the PDT event log, which is a table in a database connection's temp schema that tracks the trigger and build activity of persisted tables.
- This is a brief guide to the available fields in the PDT Event Log Explore: Field Description Action Describes the action that occurred; this may include regeneration, drop, creation, and reaping activity.
- A visualization that shows all the create events that have occurred recently, grouped by a summary of the types of actions that caused the events.
- These are the persisted tables that have been deployed to production on your instance; these persisted tables provide the data for your users' Explore queries. (If you are in Production Mode or if you don't have develop permissions, the Persistent Derived Tables page will not display any tabs, and the page will show information for production persisted tables only.) The Development tab shows the development persisted tables .
