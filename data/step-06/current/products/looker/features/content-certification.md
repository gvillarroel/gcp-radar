- A user who can manage a folder can manipulate the contents of a folder (copying, moving, deleting, and renaming dashboards and Looks), organize the folder itself (renaming, moving, or deleting the folder), and give other users and groups access to the folder.
- A user needs to have the Manage Access, Edit access level for a folder to manage access to the folder and to edit the folder and its content (including renaming folders, moving content, and deleting Looks and dashboards).
