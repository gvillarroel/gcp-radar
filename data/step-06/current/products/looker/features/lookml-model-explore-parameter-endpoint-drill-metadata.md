Evidence snippets:
- You use sets to give Looker the following information: The fields that you want to show when drilling into a count or another measure The fields that you want to import when you join a view The fields that you want to be indexed in an Explore Because the same set can be used in many places in a model, Looker provides several methods for creating sets.
- If you wanted a field that counted users from the EU, you could use something like this: measure: eu count { type: count # COUNT(CASE WHEN users.countrycode IN 'UK','FR','ES' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) drill fields: [detail] filters: [users.countrycode: "UK,FR,ES"] } If you want to filter with a mathematical expression , be sure to enclose it in double quotes: measure: total orders above 100 dollars { type: sum # SUM(CASE WHEN order.value > 100 THEN order.value ELSE NULL END) sql: ${order.value} ;; drill fields: [detail] filters: [order.value: ">100"] } Percentages Many key performance indicators are expressed in the form of percentages, such as "the percent of items returned," "the percent of emails that resulted in a sale," or other instances of "the percent of X that Y." In LookML, the design pattern is to create counts for the two conditions and create a third field that computes the percentage between the two. dimension: returned { type: yesno } measure: count { # total count of items type: count distinct sql: ${TABLE}.id ;; drill fields: [detail] } measure: returned count { # count of returned items type: count distinct sql: ${TABLE}.id ;; drill fields: [detail] filters: [returned: "Yes"] } measure: percent returned { type: number sql: 100.0 ${returned count} / NULLIF(${count}, 0) ;; value format: "0.00" } Use the following format to compute percentages.
- The following code creates a set customers.detail and points both counts to the same set of fields. view: customers { set: detail { fields: [id, name, city] # creates named set customers.detail } measure: count { type: count drill fields: [detail ] # show fields in the set "customers.detail" } measure: in california count { type: count filters: [state: "California"] drill fields: [detail ] # show fields in the set "customers.detail" } } LookML sets are powerful in the following ways: Redeclaration of sets is additive.
- Initially, declaring these fields literally might seem sufficient: view: customers { measure: count { type: count drill fields: [id, name, city] } measure: in california count { type: count filters: [state: "California"] drill fields: [id, name, city] } } However, if you wanted to add a new field (such as customers.state ), you would have to edit both lists, unless you used the set parameter to create named sets that you can maintain in one place and use in multiple places.

Evidence snippets:
- On the action settings/enablement page, a Looker admin must configure the action's form fields to pull information from the user attribute by clicking the user attribute icon to the right of the appropriate field and selecting the desired user attribute. requiredField parameters in cell-level actions For cell-level actions, you can configure your model's LookML fields to deliver data to that action destination by specifying which tags your action supports in the requiredFields parameter of your action file.
- You can create a custom action by: Setting up a development repo Writing your action Testing your action Publishing and enabling your action, either in the Looker Action Hub or on your own private action hub server As with any action, you may need to configure your LookML models with specific parameters before you can use the action to deliver your data.
- Configuring a LookML model for use with an action For both custom actions and actions that are available from the Looker Action Hub, you must identify the relevant data fields by using the tags parameter in your LookML model.
- Be sure to identify any required fields in your LookML model with the tags parameter so that your users can use the service to send data.
