- Example: Let's say the session looks like this: session { name: ".../sessions/xxx" turns { query { text: "What is foo?" query id: ".../questions/yyy" } answer: "Foo is ..." } turns { query { text: "How about bar then?" query id: ".../questions/zzz" } } } The user can call /search API with a request like this: session: ".../sessions/xxx" session spec { query id: ".../questions/zzz" } Then, the API stores the search result, associated with the last turn.
- ExtractiveContentSpec JSON representation { "maxExtractiveAnswerCount" : integer , "maxExtractiveSegmentCount" : integer , "returnExtractiveSegmentScore" : boolean , "numPreviousSegments" : integer , "numNextSegments" : integer } Fields maxExtractiveAnswerCount integer The maximum number of extractive answers returned in each search result.
- Compared with corrected query, this field is set when SpellCorrector returned a response, but FPR(full page replacement) is not triggered because the corrction is of low confidence(eg, reversed because there are matches of the original query in document corpus). summary object ( Summary ) A summary as part of the search results.
