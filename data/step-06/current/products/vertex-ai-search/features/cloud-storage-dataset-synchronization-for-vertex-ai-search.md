- This page describes how to create a data store and ingest data for custom search apps in Vertex AI Search. go to the section for the source you plan to use: Create a data store using website content Import from BigQuery Import from Cloud Storage Sync from Google Drive Sync from Gmail (Public preview) Sync from Google Sites (Public preview) Sync from Google Calendar (Public preview) Sync from Google Groups (Public preview) Import from Cloud SQL Import from Spanner (Public preview) Import from Firestore Import from Bigtable (Public Preview) Import from AlloyDB for PostgreSQL (Public Preview) Upload structured JSON data with the API Create a data store using Terraform To sync data from a third-party data source instead, see Connect a third-party data source .
- Before you begin To import data from a source Google Cloud project that's different from the Google Cloud project with the Vertex AI Search data store, grant the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to the service- PROJECT NUMBER @gcp-sa-discoveryengine.iam.gserviceaccount.com service account in the project that contains the Vertex AI Search data store: Storage Object Admin ( roles/storage.objectAdmin ) Storage Object Viewer ( roles/storage.objectViewer ) Caution: When you import data from Cloud Storage into a Vertex AI Search data store, Cloud Storage permissions aren't imported with the data.
- The following procedure describes how to create a data connector that associates a Cloud Storage location with a Vertex AI Search data connector and how to specify a folder or file in that location for the data store that you want to create.
- The following procedure describes how to create a data connector that associates a BigQuery dataset with a Vertex AI Search data connector and how to specify a table on the dataset for each data store you want to create.

- If they're in the same project, go back to the previous step. curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ -H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT ID " \ "https://us-discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/us/dataStores/ DATA STORE ID /branches/0/documents:import" \ -d '{ "reconciliation mode": "FULL", "fhir store source": {"fhir store": "projects/ SOURCE PROJECT ID /locations/ CLOUD HEALTHCARE DATASET LOCATION /datasets/ CLOUD HEALTHCARE DATASET ID /fhirStores/ FHIR STORE ID "} }' Replace the following: PROJECT ID : the ID of the Google Cloud project that contains the Vertex AI Search data store.
- You need this value to verify the status of the import or cancel an ongoing batch import . { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/us/collections/default collection/dataStores/ DATA STORE ID /branches/0/operations/ IMPORT OPERATION ID ", "metadata": { "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.discoveryengine.v1.ImportDocumentsMetadata" } } If the source FHIR store and the target Vertex AI Search data store are in different Google Cloud projects, call the following method to perform a one-time batch import.
