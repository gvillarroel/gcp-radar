- Final score: 168
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Example #2 (coordination between /search API calls and /answer API calls): Call /answer API with the session ID generated in the first call.
- The stored search result can be used by a subsequent /answer API call (with the session ID and the query ID specified).
- The segment could then be used as input for LLMs to generate summaries and answers.
- If ranking expression backend is set to RANK BY FORMULA , the following expression types (and combinations of those chained using + or operators) are supported: double signal log(signal) exp(signal) rr(signal, double > 0) -- reciprocal rank transformation with second argument being a denominator constant. is nan(signal) -- returns 0 if signal is NaN, 1 otherwise. fill nan(signal1, signal2 double) -- if signal1 is NaN, returns signal2 double, else returns signal1.
