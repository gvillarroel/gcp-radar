Evidence snippets:
- A higher pCTR suggests that the result is more likely to satisfy the user's query and intent, making it a valuable signal for ranking. freshness rank : freshness adjustment as a rank document age : The time in hours elapsed since the document was last updated, a floating-point number (e.g., 0.25 means 15 minutes). topicality rank : topicality adjustment as a rank.
- If ranking expression backend is not provided or set to RANK BY EMBEDDING , it should be a single function or multiple functions that are joined by "+". ranking expression = function, { " + ", function }; Supported functions: double relevance score double dotProduct(embedding field path) Function variables: relevance score : pre-defined keywords, used for measure relevance between query and document. embedding field path : the document embedding field used with query embedding vector. dotProduct : embedding function between embedding field path and query embedding vector.

- If ranking expression backend is set to RANK BY FORMULA , the following expression types (and combinations of those chained using + or operators) are supported: double signal log(signal) exp(signal) rr(signal, double > 0) -- reciprocal rank transformation with second argument being a denominator constant. is nan(signal) -- returns 0 if signal is NaN, 1 otherwise. fill nan(signal1, signal2 double) -- if signal1 is NaN, returns signal2 double, else returns signal1.
