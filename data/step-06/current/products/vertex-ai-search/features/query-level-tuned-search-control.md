Evidence snippets:
- For example, suppose that you create a promote control with the following configuration in a data store with basic website search: { "conditions": [ { "queryTerms": [ { "value": "artificial intelligence", "fullMatch": true } ] } ]" ... promoteAction": { "dataStore": "https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/123456/locations/us/collections/default collection/dataStores/basic-website-data-store" \ "searchLinkPromotion": { "title": "What is AI?", "uri": "https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence", "description": "Explain what is AI" "enabled": true } } } Then, you send the following search request: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ "https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/123456/locations/us/collections/default collection/engines/basic-website-app/servingConfigs/default search:search" \ -d '{ "query": "artificial intelligence" }' You should receive a JSON response similar to the following truncated response.
- Serving control types The following types of serving controls are available: Control Description Available for Boost control Changes the returned order of results Search apps with data stores that support a schema, such as data stores that contain structured data, websites with structured data (advanced website indexing), unstructured data with metadata, or media data Filter control Removes entries from returned results Search apps with data stores that support a schema, such as data stores that contain structured data, websites (advanced website indexing), unstructured data with metadata, or media data Synonyms control Associates queries with each other Search apps with website (advanced website indexing), structured, unstructured, or media data stores Redirect control Redirects to a specified URI All search apps Promote control Promotes a specified link for a query All search apps About conditions When creating a control, you can optionally define a condition that determines when the control is applied.
- Home Documentation AI and ML Vertex AI Search Send feedback Configure serving controls for search Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- REST Run the following curl commands to create your controls. curl -X POST \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT ID " \ "https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/global/collections/default collection/engines/ APP ID /controls?controlId= CONTROL ID " \ -d '{ "displayName": " DISPLAY NAME ", "solutionType": "SOLUTION TYPE SEARCH", "useCases": [" USE CASE "], "conditions": { "queryTerms": [ { "value": " VALUE ", "fullMatch": true } ], "activeTimeRange": [ { "startTime": " START TIMESTAMP ", "endTime": " END TIMESTAMP " } ], "queryRegex": " VALUE REGEX " }, "promoteAction": { "dataStore": " DATA STORE RESOURCE PATH ", "searchLinkPromotion": { "document": " DOCUMENT RESOURCE PATH ", "title": " TITLE ", "uri": " URI ", "description": " DESCRIPTION ", "enabled": ENABLED TRUE FALSE , } } }' Replace the following: PROJECT ID : the number or ID of your Google Cloud project.
