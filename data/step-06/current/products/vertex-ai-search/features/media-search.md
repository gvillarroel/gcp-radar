Evidence snippets:
- NumberConstraint JSON representation { "fieldName" : string , "comparison" : enum ( Comparison ) , "value" : number , "querySegment" : string } Fields fieldName string Name of the numerical field as defined in the schema. comparison enum ( Comparison ) The comparison operation performed between the field value and the value specified in the constraint. value number The value specified in the numerical constraint. querySegment string Identifies the keywords within the search query that match a filter.
- This score is calculated using a probabilistic model to estimate the probability that a document is relevant to a given query. relevance score : semantic relevance adjustment that uses a proprietary Google model to determine the meaning and intent behind a user's query in context with the content in the documents. pctr rank : predicted conversion rate adjustment as a rank use predicted Click-through rate (pCTR) to gauge the relevance and attractiveness of a search result from a user's perspective.
- Example: Let's say the session looks like this: session { name: ".../sessions/xxx" turns { query { text: "What is foo?" query id: ".../questions/yyy" } answer: "Foo is ..." } turns { query { text: "How about bar then?" query id: ".../questions/zzz" } } } The user can call /search API with a request like this: session: ".../sessions/xxx" session spec { query id: ".../questions/zzz" } Then, the API stores the search result, associated with the last turn.
- Compared with corrected query, this field is set when SpellCorrector returned a response, but FPR(full page replacement) is not triggered because the corrction is of low confidence(eg, reversed because there are matches of the original query in document corpus). summary object ( Summary ) A summary as part of the search results.
