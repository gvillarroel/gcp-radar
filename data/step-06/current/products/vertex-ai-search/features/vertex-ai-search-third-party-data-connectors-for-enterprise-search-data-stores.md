Evidence snippets:
- You have configured SSO with Google Identity such that your users begin their sign in using Google Identity and then get directed to your third-party identity provider. (You might have already done this sync when setting up other Google Cloud resources or Google Workspace.) Third-party identity provider federation: If you use an external identity provider—for example, Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, or Ping, but don't want to sync your identities into Google Cloud Identity, then you must set up Workforce Identity Federation in Google Cloud before you can turn on data source access control for Vertex AI Search.
- When following the steps for data import in Create a search data store , make sure to do the following: Upload your metadata with ACL information from the same bucket as your unstructured data If using the API, set GcsSource.dataSchema to document Unstructured data from BigQuery When setting up a data store for unstructured data from BigQuery, you need to set the data store as access controlled and provide ACL metadata using a predefined schema for Vertex AI Search: When preparing your data, specify the following schema.
- When following the steps for data import in Create a search data store , make sure to do the following: If using the console, then when specifying the kind of data you're uploading, select JSONL for structured data with metadata If using the API, set BigQuerySource.dataSchema to document Preview results in the Workforce Identity Federation console To preview results for apps with third-party access control in the Google Cloud console, you must sign in with your organization's credentials.
- Google recommends that you create a custom IAM role to grant to your user group, using the following permissions: discoveryengine.answers.get discoveryengine.servingConfigs.answer discoveryengine.servingConfigs.search discoveryengine.sessions.get discoveryengine.widgetConfigs.get For more information about permissions for Vertex AI Search resources using Identity and Access Management (IAM), see Access control with IAM .
