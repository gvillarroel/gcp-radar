- SessionSpec JSON representation { "queryId" : string , // Union field search result persistence count can be only one of the // following: "searchResultPersistenceCount" : integer // End of list of possible types for union field // search result persistence count . } Fields queryId string If set, the search result gets stored to the "turn" specified by this query ID.
- For example, [1] means that the sentence is attributed to the first search result. [2, 3] means that the sentence is attributed to both the second and third search results. ignoreAdversarialQuery boolean Specifies whether to filter out adversarial queries.
- If this field is set to true , we skip generating summaries for adversarial queries and return fallback messages instead. ignoreNonSummarySeekingQuery boolean Specifies whether to filter out queries that are not summary-seeking.
- Server behavior defaults to DISABLED . geoSearchQueryDetectionFieldNames[] string Field names used for location-based filtering, where geolocation filters are detected in natural language search queries.

- In this case the filter would look like this: filter --> name:'ANY("king kong")' For more information about filtering including syntax and filter operators, see Filter boostSpec object ( BoostSpec ) Boost specification to boost certain documents in search results which may affect the answer query response.
- Server behavior defaults to DISABLED . geoSearchQueryDetectionFieldNames[] string Field names used for location-based filtering, where geolocation filters are detected in natural language search queries.
- Filtering in Vertex AI Search is done by mapping the LHS filter key to a key property defined in the Vertex AI Search backend -- this mapping is defined by the customer in their schema.
