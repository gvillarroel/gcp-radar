Evidence snippets:
- The grounded generation API uses specialized, fine-tuned Gemini models and is an effective way to reduce hallucinations and provide responses grounded to your sources or third-party sources including references to grounding support content.
- Google Search : When you use Grounding with Google Search for your Gemini model, then Gemini uses Google Search and generates output that is grounded to the relevant search results.
- If you generated the answers using an answer generation model other than the Google models, you can check the grounding of these answers using the check grounding method.
- Model Garden: If you want full control and the model of your choice, you can use any of the models in Vertex AI Model Garden for generation.
