- Final score: 188
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Serving control types The following types of serving controls are available: Control Description Available for Boost control Changes the returned order of results Search apps with data stores that support a schema, such as data stores that contain structured data, websites with structured data (advanced website indexing), unstructured data with metadata, or media data Filter control Removes entries from returned results Search apps with data stores that support a schema, such as data stores that contain structured data, websites (advanced website indexing), unstructured data with metadata, or media data Synonyms control Associates queries with each other Search apps with website (advanced website indexing), structured, unstructured, or media data stores Redirect control Redirects to a specified URI All search apps Promote control Promotes a specified link for a query All search apps About conditions When creating a control, you can optionally define a condition that determines when the control is applied.
- Home Documentation AI and ML Vertex AI Search Send feedback Configure serving controls for search Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- For example, suppose that you create a promote control with the following configuration in a data store with basic website search: { "conditions": [ { "queryTerms": [ { "value": "artificial intelligence", "fullMatch": true } ] } ]" ... promoteAction": { "dataStore": "https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/123456/locations/us/collections/default collection/dataStores/basic-website-data-store" \ "searchLinkPromotion": { "title": "What is AI?", "uri": "https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence", "description": "Explain what is AI" "enabled": true } } } Then, you send the following search request: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ "https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/123456/locations/us/collections/default collection/engines/basic-website-app/servingConfigs/default search:search" \ -d '{ "query": "artificial intelligence" }' You should receive a JSON response similar to the following truncated response.
- Create and attach promote serving controls A promote serving control lets you display a link as a promoted result and is available for the following types of search data stores: Website data stores with basic website search: For these data stores, you don't need to attach a promote control to the serving config of the app.
