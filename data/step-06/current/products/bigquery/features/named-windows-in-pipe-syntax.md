Evidence snippets:
- Produce AS ( SELECT 'apples' AS item , 2 AS sales , 'fruit' AS category UNION ALL SELECT 'apples' AS item , 7 AS sales , 'fruit' AS category UNION ALL SELECT 'carrots' AS item , 0 AS sales , 'vegetable' AS category UNION ALL SELECT 'bananas' AS item , 15 AS sales , 'fruit' AS category ); The following queries each contain valid pipe syntax that shows how you can build a query sequentially.
- ItemData USING ( item ); / ---------+-------------+-----------+-----+ item total sales num sales id +---------+-------------+-----------+-----+ apples 9 2 123 bananas 15 1 456 +---------+-------------+-----------+----- / Key differences from standard syntax Pipe syntax differs from standard syntax in the following ways: Queries can start with a FROM clause .
- Use cases Common use cases for pipe syntax include the following: Ad-hoc analysis and incremental query building : The logical order of operations makes it easier to write and debug queries.

Evidence snippets:
- This topic describes the syntax for SQL queries in GoogleSQL for BigQuery.
- It's also okay for recursive entries to depend on non-recursive entries and vice-versa: WITH RECURSIVE T0 AS ( SELECT 1 AS n ), T1 AS (( SELECT FROM T0 ) UNION ALL ( SELECT n + 1 FROM T1 WHERE n < 4 )), T2 AS (( SELECT 1 AS n ) UNION ALL ( SELECT n + 1 FROM T2 WHERE n < 4 )), T3 AS ( SELECT FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 USING ( n )) SELECT FROM T3 ORDER BY n / ---+ n +---+ 1 2 3 4 +--- / Aggregate functions can be invoked in subqueries, as long as they aren't aggregating on the table being defined: WITH RECURSIVE T0 AS ( SELECT FROM UNNEST ( [ 60 , 20 , 30 ] )), T1 AS (( SELECT 1 AS n ) UNION ALL ( SELECT n + ( SELECT COUNT ( ) FROM T0 ) FROM T1 WHERE n < 4 )) SELECT FROM T1 ORDER BY n / ---+ n +---+ 1 4 +--- / INNER JOIN can be used inside subqueries: WITH RECURSIVE T0 AS ( SELECT 1 AS n ), T1 AS (( SELECT 1 AS n ) UNION ALL ( SELECT n + 1 FROM T1 INNER JOIN T0 USING ( n ))) SELECT FROM T1 ORDER BY n / ---+ n +---+ 1 2 +--- / CROSS JOIN can be used inside subqueries: WITH RECURSIVE T0 AS ( SELECT 2 AS p ), T1 AS (( SELECT 1 AS n ) UNION ALL ( SELECT T1 . n + T0 . p FROM T1 CROSS JOIN T0 WHERE T1 . n < 4 )) SELECT FROM T1 CROSS JOIN T0 ORDER BY n / ---+---+ n p +---+---+ 1 2 3 2 5 2 +---+--- / Recursive CTEs can be used inside CREATE TABLE AS SELECT statements.
- SELECT item FROM Produce WHERE Produce . category = 'vegetable' QUALIFY RANK () OVER ( PARTITION BY category ORDER BY purchases DESC ) < = 3 / ---------+ item +---------+ kale lettuce cabbage +--------- / WINDOW clause WINDOW named window expression [, ...] named window expression: named window AS { named window ( [ window specification ] ) } A WINDOW clause defines a list of named windows.
- The following example creates a table named new table in mydataset : CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE myproject.mydataset.new table AS WITH RECURSIVE T1 AS ( SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL SELECT n + 1 FROM T1 WHERE n < 3 ) SELECT FROM T1 Recursive CTEs can be used inside CREATE VIEW AS SELECT statements.

Evidence snippets:
- Examples The following table function takes an INT64 parameter that is used to filter the results of a query: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example specifies the return TABLE type in the RETURNS clause: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) RETURNS TABLE<name STRING , year INT64 , total INT64 > AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example computes total sales for items with the name item name from the orders table: CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . compute sales ( orders TABLE<item STRING , sales INT64 > , item name STRING ) AS ( SELECT SUM ( sales ) AS total sales , item FROM orders WHERE item = item name GROUP BY item ); CREATE PROCEDURE statement Creates a new procedure , which is a block of statements that can be called from other queries.
- Syntax: '{ "differential privacy policy": { "privacy unit column": value, "max epsilon per query": value, "epsilon budget": value, "delta per query": value, "delta budget": value, "max groups contributed": value } }' Parameters: differential privacy policy : The differential privacy policy for the view. privacy unit column : The column that represents the privacy unit column for differentially private queries on the view. value is a JSON string. max epsilon per query : The maximum amount of epsilon that can be specified for a differentially private query on the view. value is a JSON number from 0.001 to 1e+15. epsilon budget : The amount of epsilon that can be used in totality for all differentially private queries on the view. value is JSON number from 0.001 to 1e+15. delta per query : The maximum amount of delta that can be specified for a differentially private query on the view. value is a JSON number from 1e-15 to 1. delta budget : The amount of delta that can be used in totality for all differentially private queries on the view.
- The table schema contains 2 columns: transaction id: An integer transaction date: A date The table option list specifies the: Partition expiration: Three days Description: A table partitioned by transaction date Creating a partitioned table from the result of a query The following example creates a partitioned table named days with rain in mydataset using a DATE column: CREATE TABLE mydataset . days with rain PARTITION BY date OPTIONS ( partition expiration days = 365 , description = "weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day" ) AS SELECT DATE ( CAST ( year AS INT64 ), CAST ( mo AS INT64 ), CAST ( da AS INT64 )) AS date , ( SELECT ANY VALUE ( name ) FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.stations AS stations WHERE stations . usaf = stn ) AS station name , -- Stations can have multiple names prcp FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod2017 AS weather WHERE prcp != 99.9 -- Filter unknown values AND prcp > 0 -- Filter stations/days with no precipitation If you haven't configured a default project, prepend a project ID to the dataset name in the example SQL, and enclose the name in backticks if project id contains special characters: project id.dataset.table .
