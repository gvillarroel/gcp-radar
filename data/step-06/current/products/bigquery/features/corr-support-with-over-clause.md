- Examples The following table function takes an INT64 parameter that is used to filter the results of a query: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example specifies the return TABLE type in the RETURNS clause: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) RETURNS TABLE<name STRING , year INT64 , total INT64 > AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example computes total sales for items with the name item name from the orders table: CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . compute sales ( orders TABLE<item STRING , sales INT64 > , item name STRING ) AS ( SELECT SUM ( sales ) AS total sales , item FROM orders WHERE item = item name GROUP BY item ); CREATE PROCEDURE statement Creates a new procedure , which is a block of statements that can be called from other queries.

Evidence snippets:
- Example This query adds the GROUPING function to the previous example to better identify the rows added because of the ROLLUP function. legacySQL SELECT year , GROUPING ( year ) as rollup year , is male , GROUPING ( is male ) as rollup gender , COUNT ( 1 ) as count FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE year > = 2000 AND year < = 2002 GROUP BY ROLLUP ( year , is male ) ORDER BY year , is male ; These are the result the new query returns. +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ year rollup year is male rollup gender count +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ NULL 1 NULL 1 12122730 2000 0 NULL 1 4063823 2000 0 false 0 1984255 2000 0 true 0 2079568 2001 0 NULL 1 4031531 2001 0 false 0 1970770 2001 0 true 0 2060761 2002 0 NULL 1 4027376 2002 0 false 0 1966519 2002 0 true 0 2060857 +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ Notes: Non-aggregated fields in the SELECT clause must be listed in the GROUP BY clause. legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word , corpus ; / Succeeds because all non-aggregated fields are group keys. / legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word ; / Fails because corpus is not aggregated nor is it a group key. / Expressions computed in the SELECT clause cannot be used in the corresponding GROUP BY clause. legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) word count FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word , corpus , word count ; / Fails because word count is not visible to this GROUP BY clause. / Grouping by float and double values is not supported, because the equality function for those types is not well-defined.
- This window function requires ORDER BY in the OVER clause. legacySQL SELECT word , word count , RANK () OVER ( PARTITION BY corpus ORDER BY word count DESC ) rank , FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE corpus = 'othello' and length ( word ) > 10 LIMIT 5 Returns: word word count rank handkerchief 29 1 satisfaction 5 2 displeasure 4 3 instruments 4 3 circumstance 3 5 RATIO TO REPORT( <column> ) Returns the ratio of each value to the sum of the values, as a double between 0 and 1. legacySQL SELECT word , word count , RATIO TO REPORT ( word count ) OVER ( PARTITION BY corpus ORDER BY word count DESC ) r to r , FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE corpus = 'othello' and length ( word ) > 10 LIMIT 5 Returns: word word count r to r handkerchief 29 0.6444444444444445 satisfaction 5 0.1111111111111111 displeasure 4 0.08888888888888889 instruments 4 0.08888888888888889 circumstance 3 0.06666666666666667 ROW NUMBER() Returns the current row number of the query result over the window, starting with 1. legacySQL SELECT word , word count , ROW NUMBER () OVER ( PARTITION BY corpus ORDER BY word count DESC ) row num , FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE corpus = 'othello' and length ( word ) > 10 LIMIT 5 Returns: word word count row num handkerchief 29 1 satisfaction 5 2 displeasure 4 3 instruments 4 4 circumstance 3 5 Other functions Syntax Other functions CASE WHEN ...
- This window function requires ORDER BY in the OVER clause. legacySQL SELECT word , word count , DENSE RANK () OVER ( PARTITION BY corpus ORDER BY word count DESC ) dense rank , FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE corpus = 'othello' and length ( word ) > 10 LIMIT 5 Returns: word word count dense rank handkerchief 29 1 satisfaction 5 2 displeasure 4 3 instruments 4 3 circumstance 3 4 FIRST VALUE( <field name> ) Returns the first value of <field name> in the window. legacySQL SELECT word , word count , FIRST VALUE ( word ) OVER ( PARTITION BY corpus ORDER BY word count DESC ) fv , FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE corpus = 'othello' and length ( word ) > 10 LIMIT 1 Returns: word word count fv imperfectly 1 imperfectly LAG( <expr> [, <offset> [, <default value> ]]) Enables you to read data from a previous row within a window.
- In the example query, the ORDER BY clause causes the window to be computed from the start of the partition to the current row, which generates a cumulative sum for that year. legacySQL SELECT corpus date , corpus , word count , SUM ( word count ) OVER ( PARTITION BY corpus date ORDER BY word count ) annual total FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word = 'love' ORDER BY corpus date , word count Returns: corpus date corpus word count annual total 0 various 37 37 0 sonnets 157 194 1590 2kinghenryvi 18 18 1590 1kinghenryvi 24 42 1590 3kinghenryvi 40 82 CUME DIST() Returns a double that indicates the cumulative distribution of a value in a group of values, calculated using the formula <number of rows preceding or tied with the current row> / <total rows> .
