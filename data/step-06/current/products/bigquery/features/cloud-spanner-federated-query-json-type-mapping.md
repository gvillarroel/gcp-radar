- Examples The following table function takes an INT64 parameter that is used to filter the results of a query: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example specifies the return TABLE type in the RETURNS clause: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) RETURNS TABLE<name STRING , year INT64 , total INT64 > AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example computes total sales for items with the name item name from the orders table: CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . compute sales ( orders TABLE<item STRING , sales INT64 > , item name STRING ) AS ( SELECT SUM ( sales ) AS total sales , item FROM orders WHERE item = item name GROUP BY item ); CREATE PROCEDURE statement Creates a new procedure , which is a block of statements that can be called from other queries.
- Syntax: '{ "differential privacy policy": { "privacy unit column": value, "max epsilon per query": value, "epsilon budget": value, "delta per query": value, "delta budget": value, "max groups contributed": value } }' Parameters: differential privacy policy : The differential privacy policy for the view. privacy unit column : The column that represents the privacy unit column for differentially private queries on the view. value is a JSON string. max epsilon per query : The maximum amount of epsilon that can be specified for a differentially private query on the view. value is a JSON number from 0.001 to 1e+15. epsilon budget : The amount of epsilon that can be used in totality for all differentially private queries on the view. value is JSON number from 0.001 to 1e+15. delta per query : The maximum amount of delta that can be specified for a differentially private query on the view. value is a JSON number from 1e-15 to 1. delta budget : The amount of delta that can be used in totality for all differentially private queries on the view.

Evidence snippets:
- SELECT FROM EXTERNAL QUERY ( "region.connection id" , "select from information schema.columns where table name='x';" ); Track BigQuery federated queries When you run a federated query against AlloyDB, BigQuery annotates the query with a comment similar to the following: / Federated query from BigQuery.
- Project ID: PROJECT ID , BigQuery Job ID: JOB ID / YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.millis UTC [3210532]: [2-1] db= DATABASE , user= USER ACCOUNT STATEMENT: SELECT "company id", "company type id" FROM (SELECT FROM company name table) t; / Federated query from BigQuery.
- Go to the Logs Explorer In the Query tab, enter the following query: resource.type="alloydb.googleapis.com/Instance" textPayload= "Federated query from BigQuery" Click Run query .
- If there are records available for BigQuery federated queries, a list of records similar to the following appears in Query results .

- You can optionally control how long the query runs by setting the jobTimeoutMs field in the JobConfiguration resource . curl --request POST \ "https://bigquery.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects/ PROJECT ID /jobs" \ --header "Authorization: Bearer $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) " \ --header "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \ --data '{"configuration":{"query":{"query":" QUERY ","useLegacySql":false,"continuous":true,"connectionProperties":[{"key":"service account","value":" SERVICE ACCOUNT EMAIL "}]}}}' \ --compressed Replace the following: PROJECT ID : your project ID.

- Continuous queries let you analyze incoming data in BigQuery in real time, and then either export the results to Bigtable, Pub/Sub, or Spanner, or write the results to a BigQuery table.
- CURRENT TIMESTAMP () - INTERVAL 10 MINUTE ) WHERE CHANGE TYPE = 'DELETE' ); Export data to a Bigtable table The following example shows a continuous query that filters data from a BigQuery table that is receiving streaming taxi ride information, and exports the data into a Bigtable table in real time: EXPORT DATA OPTIONS ( format = 'CLOUD BIGTABLE' , truncate = TRUE , overwrite = TRUE , uri = 'https://bigtable.googleapis.com/projects/myproject/instances/mybigtableinstance/tables/taxi-real-time-rides' ) AS ( SELECT CAST ( CONCAT ( ride id , timestamp , latitude , longitude ) AS STRING ) AS rowkey , STRUCT ( timestamp , latitude , longitude , meter reading , ride status , passenger count ) AS features FROM APPENDS ( TABLE myproject.real time taxi streaming.taxirides , -- Configure the APPENDS TVF start timestamp to specify when you want to -- start processing data using your continuous query. -- This example starts processing at 10 minutes before the current time.
