Evidence snippets:
- The request uses the fields parameter to specify which fields to return. https://www.googleapis.com/demo/v1? fields=kind,items(title,characteristics/length) The partial response looks like this: 200 OK { "kind": "demo", "items": [{ "title": "First title", "characteristics": { "length": "short" } }, { "title": "Second title", "characteristics": { "length": "long" } }, ... ] } Note: For APIs that support query parameters for data pagination ( maxResults and nextPageToken , for example), use those parameters to reduce the results of each query to a manageable size.
- Here is an example that assumes the Demo resource uses ETags: GET https://www.googleapis.com/demo/v1/324 ?fields=etag,title,comment,characteristics Authorization: Bearer your auth token This is the partial response: 200 OK { "etag": " ETagString " "title": "New title" "comment": "First comment.", "characteristics": { "length": "short", "level": "5", "followers": ["Jo", "Will"], } } The following patch request is based on that response.

- As shown below, it also uses the fields parameter to limit the data returned in the patch response: PATCH https://www.googleapis.com/demo/v1/324?fields=etag,title,comment,characteristics Authorization: Bearer your auth token Content-Type: application/json If-Match: " ETagString " { "etag": " ETagString " "title": "" , / Clear the value of the title by setting it to the empty string. / "comment": null , / Delete the comment by replacing its value with null. / "characteristics": { "length": "short", "level": "10" , / Modify the level value. / "followers": ["Jo", "Liz" ], / Replace the followers array to delete Will and add Liz. / "accuracy": "high" / Add a new characteristic. / }, } The server responds with a 200 OK HTTP status code, and the partial representation of the updated resource: 200 OK { "etag": " newETagString " "title": "" , / Title is cleared; deleted comment field is missing. / "characteristics": { "length": "short", "level": "10" , / Value is updated. / "followers": ["Jo" "Liz" ], / New follower Liz is present; deleted Will is missing. / "accuracy": "high" / New characteristic is present. / } } Constructing a patch request directly For some patch requests, you need to base them on the data you previously retrieved.
