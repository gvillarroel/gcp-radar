Evidence snippets:
- Copy datasets for multiregional configurations Because BigQuery disallows cross-regional queries, you can't use the strategy of segmenting data with authorized views when data marts must exist across multiple regions.
- A multiregional configuration uses the BigQuery Data Transfer Service to copy datasets across regions.
- This reservation is assigned to the top-level organization, and it gives slots to any BigQuery user who isn't using a project that has a dedicated reservation Data processing : 1000 slots, ignore idle.
- Best practices for multi-tenant workloads on BigQuery This document provides techniques and best practices for common patterns that are used in multi-tenant data platforms and enterprise data marts.

Evidence snippets:
- The table schema contains 2 columns: transaction id: An integer transaction date: A date The table option list specifies the: Partition expiration: Three days Description: A table partitioned by transaction date Creating a partitioned table from the result of a query The following example creates a partitioned table named days with rain in mydataset using a DATE column: CREATE TABLE mydataset . days with rain PARTITION BY date OPTIONS ( partition expiration days = 365 , description = "weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day" ) AS SELECT DATE ( CAST ( year AS INT64 ), CAST ( mo AS INT64 ), CAST ( da AS INT64 )) AS date , ( SELECT ANY VALUE ( name ) FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.stations AS stations WHERE stations . usaf = stn ) AS station name , -- Stations can have multiple names prcp FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod2017 AS weather WHERE prcp != 99.9 -- Filter unknown values AND prcp > 0 -- Filter stations/days with no precipitation If you haven't configured a default project, prepend a project ID to the dataset name in the example SQL, and enclose the name in backticks if project id contains special characters: project id.dataset.table .
- For more information about editions, see Introduction to BigQuery editions . autoscale max slots INTEGER The maximum number of slots that could be added to the reservation by autoscaling. secondary location STRING The secondary location to use in the case of disaster recovery. max slots INTEGER The maximum number of slots the reservation can consume.
- You want to transfer data from that table to a BigQuery table myotherdataset.shipments in the US multi-region.
