Evidence snippets:
- Continuous queries can process data that has been written to standard BigQuery tables by using one of the following methods: The BigQuery Storage Write API The tabledata.insertAll method Batch load The INSERT DML statement Mutating data manipulation language (DML) statements such as DELETE , UPDATE , and MERGE when exporting data to Pub/Sub .
- Running EXPORT DATA statements to export data from BigQuery to Spanner tables.
- When exporting data to Bigtable, Spanner, or Pub/Sub locational endpoints you can only target Bigtable, Spanner, or Pub/Sub resources that fall within the same Google Cloud regional boundary as the BigQuery dataset that contains the table you are querying.
- Supported functionality The following operations are supported in continuous queries: Running INSERT statements to write data from a continuous query into a BigQuery table.

Evidence snippets:
- Examples The following table function takes an INT64 parameter that is used to filter the results of a query: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example specifies the return TABLE type in the RETURNS clause: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) RETURNS TABLE<name STRING , year INT64 , total INT64 > AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example computes total sales for items with the name item name from the orders table: CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . compute sales ( orders TABLE<item STRING , sales INT64 > , item name STRING ) AS ( SELECT SUM ( sales ) AS total sales , item FROM orders WHERE item = item name GROUP BY item ); CREATE PROCEDURE statement Creates a new procedure , which is a block of statements that can be called from other queries.
- Example: export function finalize ( finalState , initialSum ) Serialization functions for a JavaScript UDAF If you want to work with non-serializable aggregation states, the JavaScript UDAF must provide the serialize and deserialize functions: serialize function: Converts an aggregation state into a BigQuery-serializable object.
- Example: export function deserialize ( stateToDeserialize , initialSum ) Required permissions This statement requires the following IAM permissions : Permission Resource bigquery.routines.create The dataset where you create the function.
- Run DDL statements You can run DDL statements by using the Google Cloud console, by using the bq command-line tool, by calling the jobs.query REST API, or programmatically using the BigQuery API client libraries .

Evidence snippets:
- Continuous queries let you analyze incoming data in BigQuery in real time, and then either export the results to Bigtable, Pub/Sub, or Spanner, or write the results to a BigQuery table.
- CURRENT TIMESTAMP () - INTERVAL 10 MINUTE ) WHERE CHANGE TYPE = 'DELETE' ); Export data to a Bigtable table The following example shows a continuous query that filters data from a BigQuery table that is receiving streaming taxi ride information, and exports the data into a Bigtable table in real time: EXPORT DATA OPTIONS ( format = 'CLOUD BIGTABLE' , truncate = TRUE , overwrite = TRUE , uri = 'https://bigtable.googleapis.com/projects/myproject/instances/mybigtableinstance/tables/taxi-real-time-rides' ) AS ( SELECT CAST ( CONCAT ( ride id , timestamp , latitude , longitude ) AS STRING ) AS rowkey , STRUCT ( timestamp , latitude , longitude , meter reading , ride status , passenger count ) AS features FROM APPENDS ( TABLE myproject.real time taxi streaming.taxirides , -- Configure the APPENDS TVF start timestamp to specify when you want to -- start processing data using your continuous query. -- This example starts processing at 10 minutes before the current time.
- CURRENT TIMESTAMP () - INTERVAL 10 MINUTE ) WHERE ride status = 'enroute' ); Export data to a Spanner table The following example shows a continuous query that filters data from a BigQuery table that is receiving streaming taxi ride information, and then exports the data into a Spanner table in real time: EXPORT DATA OPTIONS ( format = 'CLOUD SPANNER' , uri = 'https://spanner.googleapis.com/projects/myproject/instances/myspannerinstance/databases/taxi-real-time-rides' , spanner options = " "" { " table ": " rides ", -- To ensure data is written to Spanner in the correct sequence -- during a continuous export, use the change timestamp column -- option.
