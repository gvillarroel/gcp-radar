Evidence snippets:
- However, the following query does not limit the scan based on the second filter condition, TABLE SUFFIX = (SELECT SUBSTR(MAX(table name), LENGTH('gsod19') + 1) FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.INFORMATION SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE table name LIKE 'gsod194%') , because it is a dynamic expression: #standardSQL Scans all tables with names that fall between gsod1940 and gsod1960 SELECT ROUND (( max - 32 ) 5 / 9 , 1 ) celsius FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod19 WHERE TABLE SUFFIX BETWEEN '40' AND '60' AND TABLE SUFFIX = ( SELECT SUBSTR ( MAX ( table name ), LENGTH ( 'gsod19' ) + 1 ) FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.INFORMATION SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE table name LIKE 'gsod194%' ) As a workaround, you can perform two separate queries instead; for example: First query: standardSQL Get the list of tables that match the required table name prefixes SELECT SUBSTR(MAX(table name), LENGTH('gsod19') + 1) FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.INFORMATION SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE table name LIKE 'gsod194%' Second query: standardSQL Construct the second query based on the values from the first query SELECT ROUND((max-32) 5/9,1) celsius FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod19 WHERE TABLE SUFFIX = '49' These example queries use the INFORMATION SCHEMA.TABLES view.
- For example, the following query is valid because it uses backticks: #standardSQL / Valid SQL query / SELECT max FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod WHERE max != 9999.9 # code for missing data AND TABLE SUFFIX = '1929' ORDER BY max DESC The following query is NOT valid because it isn't properly quoted with backticks: #standardSQL / Syntax error: Expected end of statement but got "-" at [4:11] / SELECT max FROM missing backticks bigquery - public - data . noaa gsod . gsod WHERE max != 9999.9 # code for missing data AND TABLE SUFFIX = '1929' ORDER BY max DESC Quotation marks don't work: #standardSQL / Syntax error: Unexpected string literal: 'bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod ' at [4:3] / SELECT max FROM quotes are not backticks 'bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod ' WHERE max != 9999.9 # code for missing data AND TABLE SUFFIX = '1929' ORDER BY max DESC Query tables using wildcard tables Wildcard tables enable you to query several tables concisely.
- For example, the following query does not limit the tables scanned for the wildcard table bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod19 because the filter uses the dynamic value of the table id column: #standardSQL Scans all tables that match the prefix gsod19 SELECT ROUND (( max - 32 ) 5 / 9 , 1 ) celsius FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod19 WHERE TABLE SUFFIX = ( SELECT SUBSTR ( MAX ( table name ), LENGTH ( 'gsod19' ) + 1 ) FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.INFORMATION SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE table name LIKE 'gsod194%' ) As another example, the following query limits the scan based on the first filter condition, TABLE SUFFIX BETWEEN '40' and '60' , because it is a constant expression.
- For example, to find the maximum temperature reported in the years between 1929 and 1935 inclusive, use the table wildcard to represent the last two digits of the year: standardSQL SELECT max, ROUND((max-32) 5/9,1) celsius, mo, da, year FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod19 WHERE max != 9999.9 # code for missing data AND TABLE SUFFIX BETWEEN '29' and '35' ORDER BY max DESC Scanning a range of ingestion-time partitioned tables using PARTITIONTIME To scan a range of ingestion-time partitioned tables, use the PARTITIONTIME pseudocolumn with the TABLE SUFFIX pseudocolumn.

Evidence snippets:
- To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the Required permissions section: Required permissions The following permissions are required to create a table: bigquery.tables.create on the dataset where you're creating the table. bigquery.tables.getData on all tables and views that your query references if you're saving query results as a table. bigquery.jobs.create on the project if you're creating the table by loading data or by saving query results to a table. bigquery.tables.updateData on the table if you're appending to or overwriting a table with query results.
- The metadata that's returned is for all types of tables in mydataset in your default project. mydataset contains the following tables: mytable1 : a standard BigQuery table myview1 : a BigQuery view To run the query against a project other than your default project, add the project ID to the dataset in the following format: project id . dataset .INFORMATION SCHEMA. view ; for example, myproject.mydataset.INFORMATION SCHEMA.TABLES .
- The following predefined IAM roles include bigquery.tables.get permissions: bigquery.metadataViewer bigquery.dataViewer bigquery.dataOwner bigquery.dataEditor bigquery.admin In addition, if a user has bigquery.datasets.create permissions, when that user creates a dataset, they are granted bigquery.dataOwner access to it. bigquery.dataOwner access gives the user the ability to retrieve table metadata.
- Because the table you're querying is in another project, the bigquery-public-data project, you add the project ID to the dataset in the following format: project id . dataset .INFORMATION SCHEMA. view ; for example, bigquery-public-data.census bureau usa.INFORMATION SCHEMA.TABLES .
