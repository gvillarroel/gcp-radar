Evidence snippets:
- Go to BigQuery In the query editor, run the following statement: CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL bqml tutorial.sample model OPTIONS ( model type = 'logistic reg' ) AS SELECT IF ( totals . transactions IS NULL , 0 , 1 ) AS label , IFNULL ( device . operatingSystem , "" ) AS os , device . isMobile AS is mobile , IFNULL ( geoNetwork . country , "" ) AS country , IFNULL ( totals . pageviews , 0 ) AS pageviews FROM bigquery-public-data.google analytics sample.ga sessions WHERE TABLE SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170630' The query takes several minutes to complete.
- Required roles To create a model and run inference, you must be granted the following roles: BigQuery Data Editor ( roles/bigquery.dataEditor ) BigQuery User ( roles/bigquery.user ) Before you begin Sign in to your Google Cloud account.
- Client () bqclient . create dataset ( "bqml tutorial" , exists ok = True ) Create a logistic regression model Create a logistic regression model using the Analytics sample dataset for BigQuery.
- In this tutorial, you use the sample Google Analytics sample dataset for BigQuery to create a model that predicts whether a website visitor will make a transaction.

Evidence snippets:
- For more information, see Set up authentication for client libraries . // Import the Google Cloud client library and create a client const { BigQuery } = require ( ' @google-cloud/bigquery ' ); const bigquery = new BigQuery (); async function ddlCreateView () { // Creates a view via a DDL query / TODO(developer): Uncomment the following lines before running the sample. / // const projectId = "my project" // const datasetId = "my dataset" // const tableId = "my new view" const query = CREATE VIEW \ ${ projectId } . ${ datasetId } . ${ tableId } \ OPTIONS( expiration timestamp=TIMESTAMP ADD( CURRENT TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 48 HOUR), friendly name="new view", description="a view that expires in 2 days", labels=[("org unit", "development")] ) AS SELECT name, state, year, number FROM \bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current\ WHERE state LIKE 'W%' ; // For all options, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/query const options = { query : query , }; // Run the query as a job const [ job ] = await bigquery . createQueryJob ( options ); job . on ( 'complete' , metadata = > { console . log ( Created new view ${ tableId } via job ${ metadata . id } ); }); } Python Call the Client.query() method to start a query job.
- The table schema contains 2 columns: transaction id: An integer transaction date: A date The table option list specifies the: Partition expiration: Three days Description: A table partitioned by transaction date Creating a partitioned table from the result of a query The following example creates a partitioned table named days with rain in mydataset using a DATE column: CREATE TABLE mydataset . days with rain PARTITION BY date OPTIONS ( partition expiration days = 365 , description = "weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day" ) AS SELECT DATE ( CAST ( year AS INT64 ), CAST ( mo AS INT64 ), CAST ( da AS INT64 )) AS date , ( SELECT ANY VALUE ( name ) FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.stations AS stations WHERE stations . usaf = stn ) AS station name , -- Stations can have multiple names prcp FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod2017 AS weather WHERE prcp != 99.9 -- Filter unknown values AND prcp > 0 -- Filter stations/days with no precipitation If you haven't configured a default project, prepend a project ID to the dataset name in the example SQL, and enclose the name in backticks if project id contains special characters: project id.dataset.table .
- Examples The following table function takes an INT64 parameter that is used to filter the results of a query: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example specifies the return TABLE type in the RETURNS clause: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) RETURNS TABLE<name STRING , year INT64 , total INT64 > AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example computes total sales for items with the name item name from the orders table: CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . compute sales ( orders TABLE<item STRING , sales INT64 > , item name STRING ) AS ( SELECT SUM ( sales ) AS total sales , item FROM orders WHERE item = item name GROUP BY item ); CREATE PROCEDURE statement Creates a new procedure , which is a block of statements that can be called from other queries.
- For more information, see Set up authentication for client libraries . from google.cloud import bigquery project = 'my-project' dataset id = 'my dataset' table id = 'new view' client = bigquery.Client(project=project) sql = """ CREATE VIEW {} . {} . {} OPTIONS( expiration timestamp=TIMESTAMP ADD( CURRENT TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 48 HOUR), friendly name="new view", description="a view that expires in 2 days", labels=[("org unit", "development")] ) AS SELECT name, state, year, number FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE state LIKE 'W%' """ . format ( project , dataset id , table id ) job = client . query ( sql ) # API request. job . result () # Waits for the query to finish. print ( 'Created new view " {} . {} . {} ".' . format ( job . destination . project , job . destination . dataset id , job . destination . table id , ) ) On-demand query size calculation If you use on-demand billing, BigQuery charges for data definition language (DDL) queries based on the number of bytes processed by the query.

- For more information about supported SQL statements and functions for each model type, see the following documents: End-to-end user journeys for generative AI models End-to-end user journeys for time series forecasting models End-to-end user journeys for ML models End-to-end user journeys for imported models Contribution analysis user journey Required permissions To create a dataset to store the model, you need the bigquery.datasets.create IAM permission.
- To create a model, you need the following permissions: bigquery.jobs.create bigquery.models.create bigquery.models.getData bigquery.models.updateData bigquery.connections.delegate (for remote models) The following predefined IAM roles grant these permissions: BigQuery Studio Admin BigQuery Admin For more information about IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery, see Introduction to IAM .
- To try using the TRANSFORM clause, try the Use the BigQuery ML TRANSFORM clause for feature engineering tutorial or the Create Model With Inline Transpose notebook. select list You can pass columns from query statement through to model training without transformation by either using , EXCEPT() , or by listing the column names directly.
- For example, given a set of users, items, and some ratings for a subset of the items, creates a model to predict a user's rating for items they have not rated.
