Evidence snippets:
- For example: --filter "labels.department:marketing labels.team:sales" For transfer configurations, use dataSourceIds as the key, and one of the following data sources as the value: amazon s3 - Amazon S3 data transfer azure blob storage - Azure Blob Storage data transfer dcm dt - Campaign Manager data transfer google cloud storage - Cloud Storage data transfer cross region copy - Dataset Copy dfp dt - Google Ad Manager data transfer displayvideo - Display & Video 360 data transfer google ads - Google Ads data transfer merchant center - Google Merchant Center data transfer mysql - MySQL data transfer play - Google Play data transfer scheduled query - Scheduled queries data transfer search ads - Search Ads 360 data transfer youtube channel - YouTube Channel data transfer youtube content owner - YouTube Content Owner data transfer redshift - Amazon Redshift migration on premises - Teradata migration For example: --filter labels.dataSourceIds:dcm dt For transfer runs, use states as the key and one or more of the following transfer states as the value: SUCCEEDED FAILED PENDING RUNNING CANCELLED For example: --filter="states:FAILED" For jobs, use states as the key and one or more of the following job states as the value: RUNNING PENDING DONE For example: bq ls --jobs --filter="states:RUNNING" bq ls --jobs --filter="states:RUNNING,PENDING" --jobs={true false} or -j={true false} To list jobs, set to true .
- For information about using the bq mk command with the BigQuery Data Transfer Service, see the following: Set up an Amazon S3 transfer Set up a Campaign Manager transfer Set up a Cloud Storage transfer Set up a Google Ad Manager transfer Set up a Google Ads transfer Set up a Google Merchant Center transfer (beta) Set up a Google Play transfer Set up a Search Ads 360 transfer (beta) Set up a YouTube Channel transfer Set up a YouTube Content Owner transfer Migrate data from Amazon Redshift Migrate data from Teradata bq mk --transfer run Creates a data transfer run at the specified time or time range using the specified data transfer configuration.
- For more information about using the bq ls command, see the following: Managing jobs Listing datasets in a project Creating and using tables Listing views in a dataset Working with transfers Listing table snapshots in a dataset bq mk Use the bq mk command to create a BigQuery resource.
- Assign a folder, project, or organization to a reservation. --reservation-group : Create a reservation group. --table or -t : Create a table. --transfer config : Create a transfer configuration. --transfer run : Create a transfer run for a time range. --view : Create a view.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-5`
- Final score: 132
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- A dataset-per-tenant design helps to mitigate the following concerns that an organization experiences when it scales to thousands of tenants: Administrative complexity : the total number of new projects and cloud resources on a per customer basis End-to-end latency : how up to date the datastore is for both the tenants and cross-customer analytics solutions Performance expectations : ensuring that tenant performance stays within acceptable limits Configure datasets for each tenant Within a project that is dedicated to storing customer data, each customer's data is separated by BigQuery datasets.
- If your organization needs more flexibility, the following options are available: Cloud Composer jobs : you can schedule Cloud Composer jobs to issue ETL jobs that create regional subsets before triggering the BigQuery Data Transfer Service through its client API .
- Copy datasets for multiregional configurations Because BigQuery disallows cross-regional queries, you can't use the strategy of segmenting data with authorized views when data marts must exist across multiple regions.
- When you use decentralized authority, you maintain central control of security and BigQuery capacity by using Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) , column policies, VPC Service Controls, and reservations.

### "Introduction to BigLake external tables \_|\_ BigQuery \_|\_ Google Cloud\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/biglake-intro](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/biglake-intro)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-5`
- Final score: 125
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- All customers in the FURNITURE market segment are transferred to the BigQuery region first, and then the limit of 10 is applied.
- CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE temp table AS ( SELECT l shipmode , l linenumber , l orderkey FROM aws dataset . lineitem WHERE l shipmode IN ( 'AIR' , 'REG AIR' ) AND l commitdate l receiptdate AND l shipdate l commitdate AND l receiptdate >= DATE '1997-01-01' AND l receiptdate DATE '1997-02-01' ); After the temporary table is created, the JOIN operation completes, and the following query is run: SELECT l shipmode , o orderpriority , count ( l linenumber ) AS num lineitems FROM bigquery dataset . orders JOIN temp table ON orders . o orderkey = lineitem . l orderkey GROUP BY l shipmode , o orderpriority ORDER BY l shipmode , o orderpriority ; As another example, consider the following cross-cloud join: SELECT c mktsegment , c name FROM bigquery dataset . customer WHERE c mktsegment = 'BUILDING' UNION ALL SELECT c mktsegment , c name FROM aws dataset . customer WHERE c mktsegment = 'FURNITURE' LIMIT 10 ; In this query, the LIMIT clause is not pushed down to the BigQuery Omni region.
- Consider the following query as an example: SELECT FROM bigquery dataset . bigquery table AS clients WHERE clients . sales rep IN ( SELECT id FROM aws dataset . aws table1 AS employees INNER JOIN aws dataset . aws table2 AS active employees ON employees . id = active employees . id WHERE employees . level > 3 ); This example has two transfers: one from an employees table (with a level filter) and one from an active employees table.
- Cross-cloud join required permissions To get the permissions that you need to run a cross-cloud join, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project where the join is executed: BigQuery Data Viewer ( roles/bigquery.dataViewer ) BigQuery Job User ( roles/bigquery.jobUser ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
