# BigQuery Data Transfer Service SQL Server connector

Product: BigQuery
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

BigQuery Data Transfer Service now supports transferring data from Microsoft SQL Server to BigQuery.

## Extended Definition

BigQuery Data Transfer Service supports transferring data from Microsoft SQL Server into BigQuery as a defined feature. The release notes also state that incremental data transfers for this SQL Server-to-BigQuery path are now supported (noted for April 08, 2026). Evidence for how to configure this connector via the provided CLI snippets is incomplete, as the shown data-source list examples do not include SQL Server.

## Evidence Summary

The release notes page directly confirms SQL Server-to-BigQuery transfer support in BigQuery Data Transfer Service (including incremental transfer support), while the bq CLI reference provides surrounding transfer-configuration context but no SQL Server-specific setup details in the excerpt.

Evidence snippets:
- For example: --filter "labels.department:marketing labels.team:sales" For transfer configurations, use dataSourceIds as the key, and one of the following data sources as the value: amazon s3 - Amazon S3 data transfer azure blob storage - Azure Blob Storage data transfer dcm dt - Campaign Manager data transfer google cloud storage - Cloud Storage data transfer cross region copy - Dataset Copy dfp dt - Google Ad Manager data transfer displayvideo - Display & Video 360 data transfer google ads - Google Ads data transfer merchant center - Google Merchant Center data transfer mysql - MySQL data transfer play - Google Play data transfer scheduled query - Scheduled queries data transfer search ads - Search Ads 360 data transfer youtube channel - YouTube Channel data transfer youtube content owner - YouTube Content Owner data transfer redshift - Amazon Redshift migration on premises - Teradata migration For example: --filter labels.dataSourceIds:dcm dt For transfer runs, use states as the key and one or more of the following transfer states as the value: SUCCEEDED FAILED PENDING RUNNING CANCELLED For example: --filter="states:FAILED" For jobs, use states as the key and one or more of the following job states as the value: RUNNING PENDING DONE For example: bq ls --jobs --filter="states:RUNNING" bq ls --jobs --filter="states:RUNNING,PENDING" --jobs={true false} or -j={true false} To list jobs, set to true .
- Use one of the following values: amazon s3 - Amazon S3 data transfer azure blob storage - Azure Blob Storage data transfer dcm dt - Campaign Manager data transfer google cloud storage - Cloud Storage data transfer cross region copy - Dataset Copy dfp dt - Google Ad Manager data transfer displayvideo - Display & Video 360 data transfer google ads - Google Ads data transfer merchant center - Google Merchant Center data transfer mysql - MySQL data transfer play - Google Play data transfer scheduled query - Scheduled queries data transfer search ads - Search Ads 360 data transfer youtube channel - YouTube Channel data transfer youtube content owner - YouTube Content Owner data transfer redshift - Amazon Redshift migration on premises - Teradata migration Note: The redshift and on premises values are for data migrations; before you use the bq mk --transfer config command with these values, consult the linked documentation from the preceding list. --display name= DISPLAY NAME Specifies the display name for the transfer configuration. --no auto scheduling={true false} Disables automatic scheduling of data transfer runs for this configuration.
- For information about using the bq mk command with the BigQuery Data Transfer Service, see the following: Set up an Amazon S3 transfer Set up a Campaign Manager transfer Set up a Cloud Storage transfer Set up a Google Ad Manager transfer Set up a Google Ads transfer Set up a Google Merchant Center transfer (beta) Set up a Google Play transfer Set up a Search Ads 360 transfer (beta) Set up a YouTube Channel transfer Set up a YouTube Content Owner transfer Migrate data from Amazon Redshift Migrate data from Teradata bq mk --transfer run Creates a data transfer run at the specified time or time range using the specified data transfer configuration.
- For more information, see Move an assignment to a different reservation . --display name= DISPLAY NAME Updates the display name for a transfer configuration. --etag= ETAG Acts as a filter; updates the resource only if the resource has an ETag that matches the string specified in the ETAG argument. --expiration SECONDS To update the expiration for the table, model, table snapshot, or view, include this flag.
