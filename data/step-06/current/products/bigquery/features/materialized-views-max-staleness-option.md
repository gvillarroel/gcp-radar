Evidence snippets:
- Cache-enabled tables with materialized views You can use materialized views over BigLake metadata cache-enabled tables to improve performance and efficiency when querying structured data stored in Cloud Storage or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
- BigLake tables on object stores For data lake administrators, BigLake lets you set access controls on tables rather than files, which gives you finer-grained options when setting user access to data in the data lake.
- These materialized views function like materialized views over BigQuery-managed storage tables, including the benefits of automatic refresh and smart tuning .
- If you are automatically refreshing the metadata cache for a table, and you set the staleness interval to 30 minutes, it is possible that some of your operations against the table might read from the datastore if the metadata cache refresh takes on the longer side of the usual 30 to 60 minute window.

- Control access to tables To configure access to tables and views, you can grant an IAM role to an entity at the following levels, listed in order of range of resources allowed (largest to smallest): a high level in the Google Cloud resource hierarchy such as the project, folder, or organization level the dataset level the table or view level You can also restrict data access within tables, by using the following methods: column-level security column data masking row-level security Access with any resource protected by IAM is additive.
