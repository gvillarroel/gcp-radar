### "Generate text by using a Gemini model and the AI.GENERATE_TEXT function\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/generate-text-tutorial-gemini](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/generate-text-tutorial-gemini)

Evidence snippets:
- GENERATE TEXT ( MODEL bqml tutorial.gemini model , ( SELECT CONCAT ( " "" Perform sentiment analysis on the following text and return one the following categories: positive, negative: "" " , review ) AS prompt , FROM bigquery-public-data.imdb.reviews LIMIT 5 ), STRUCT ( 0.2 AS temperature , 100 AS max output tokens )); The output is similar to the following: +----------+----------+------------------------------------------------+ title result review +----------+----------+------------------------------------------------+ Quitting Positive This movie is amazing because the fact that...
- CONNECTION ID OPTIONS ( ENDPOINT = 'gemini-2.5-flash' ); Replace the following: LOCATION : the connection location CONNECTION ID : the ID of your BigQuery connection When you view the connection details in the Google Cloud console, this is the value in the last section of the fully qualified connection ID that is shown in Connection ID , for example projects/myproject/locations/connection location/connections/ myconnection The query takes several seconds to complete, after which the model gemini model appears in the bqml tutorial dataset.
- AlreadyExists : print ( f "Connection with ID ' { connection id } ' already exists." ) print ( "Please use a different connection ID." ) except Exception as e : print ( f "An unexpected error occurred while creating the connection: { e } " ) Node.js Before trying this sample, follow the Node.js setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart using client libraries .
- ALREADY EXISTS ) { console . log ( Connection ' ${ connectionId } ' already exists. ); } else { console . error ( Error creating connection: ${ err . message } ); } } } Terraform Use the google bigquery connection resource.

### "Transform SQL translations using configuration YAML files \_|\_ BigQuery\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/config-yaml-translation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/config-yaml-translation)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-5`
- Final score: 83
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Some SQL dialects, such as Teradata, truncate values that exceed the maximum precision on write, while BigQuery returns an error in this scenario.
- Remove the upper function in the default translation output query translation rules : - instruction : "Remove upper() function" examples : - input : "upper(X)" output : "X" Create multiple translation rules to customize the translation output translation rules : - instruction : "Remove upper() function" suggestion type : QUERY CUSTOMIZATION rewrite target : TARGET SQL examples : - input : "upper(X)" output : "X" - instruction : "Insert a comment at the head that explains each statement in detail. suggestion type: QUERY CUSTOMIZATION rewrite target: TARGET SQL Remove SQL comments from the translation input query translation rules : - instruction : "Remove all the sql comments in the input sql query." suggestion type : QUERY CUSTOMIZATION rewrite target : SOURCE SQL Generate translation explanations using default LLM prompt This example uses the default LLM prompts provided by the translation service to generate text explanations: translation rules : - suggestion type : "TRANSLATION EXPLANATION" Generates translation explanations using your own natural language prompts translation rules : - suggestion type : "TRANSLATION EXPLANATION" instruction : "Explain the syntax differences between the source Teradata query and the translated GoogleSQL query." Multiple suggestion types in a single configuration YAML file translation rules : - suggestion type : "TRANSLATION EXPLANATION" instruction : "Explain the syntax differences between the source Teradata query and the translated GoogleSQL query." - instruction : "Remove upper() function" suggestion type : QUERY CUSTOMIZATION rewrite target : TARGET SQL examples : - input : "upper(X)" output : "X" - instruction : "Remove all the sql comments in the input sql query." suggestion type : QUERY CUSTOMIZATION rewrite target : SOURCE SQL Applying multiple YAML configurations When specifying a configuration YAML file in a batch or interactive SQL translation, you can select multiple configuration YAML files in a single translation job to reflect multiple transformations.
- This configuration converts numeric types to either NUMERIC or BIGNUMERIC depending on the input precision, instead of the default of INT64 . type : optimizer transformations : - name : REWRITE ZERO SCALE NUMERIC AS INTEGER enabled : false A SQL translation with this optimization might look like the following: snowflake-input.sql CREATE TABLE numbers ( i INTEGER , n NUMERIC ( 10 , 0 )); bq-output.sql CREATE TABLE numbers ( i BIGNUMERIC ( 38 ), n NUMERIC ( 29 )); Create a Gemini-based configuration YAML file Note: The Translation service can call Gemini model to generate suggestions to your translated SQL query based on your AI configuration YAML file.
- BigQuery supports the following data type conversions: DATETIME to TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP to DATETIME (accepts optional time zone) TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE to DATETIME (accepts optional time zone) CHAR to VARCHAR In the following example, the configuration YAML converts a TIMESTAMP data type to DATETIME . type : experimental object rewriter global : typeConvert : timestamp : DATETIME Setting default time zone Preview This product or feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms .

### "Migrate code with the batch SQL translator \_|\_ BigQuery \_|\_ Google Cloud\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/batch-sql-translator](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/batch-sql-translator)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-5`
- Final score: 66
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- To fixed failed translation jobs with the RelationNotFound or AttributeNotFound errors, you can also use Gemini to try to resolve these issues with the following steps.
- The following example shows a translation configuration YAML file for a Teradata to BigQuery translation: tasks: translation task: type: Teradata2BigQuery Translation translationDetails: sourceTargetMapping: - sourceSpec: baseUri: gs://bq-translations/input targetSpec: relativePath: output targetBaseUri: gs://bq-translations targetTypes: - sql sourceEnvironment: defaultDatabase: default db schemaSearchPath: - foo The following example shows a translation configuration JSON file for a Teradata to BigQuery translation: { "tasks" : { "translation task" : { "type" : "Teradata2BigQuery Translation" , "translationDetails" : { "sourceTargetMapping" : [ { "sourceSpec" : { "literal" : { "literalString" : "sel 1" , "relativePath" : "my input 1" } , "encoding" : "UTF-8" } } , { "sourceSpec" : { "literal" : { "literalString" : "sel 2" , "relativePath" : "my input 2" } , "encoding" : "UTF-8" } } ] , "targetReturnLiterals" : [ "sql/my input 1" , "sql/my input 2" ] } } } } Once the translation configuration is created, run the following command to run the translation job. bq mk --migration workflow --location = LOCATION --config file = CONFIG FILE NAME .json Replace the following: LOCATION : the location of the Google Cloud project that is running this translation job.
- Required permissions You must have the following permissions on the project to enable the BigQuery Migration Service: resourcemanager.projects.get serviceusage.services.enable serviceusage.services.get You need the following permissions on the project to access and use the BigQuery Migration Service: bigquerymigration.workflows.create bigquerymigration.workflows.get bigquerymigration.workflows.list bigquerymigration.workflows.delete bigquerymigration.subtasks.get bigquerymigration.subtasks.list Alternatively, you can use the following roles to get the same permissions: bigquerymigration.viewer - Read only access. bigquerymigration.editor - Read/write access.
- The batch SQL translator can translate the following SQL dialects into GoogleSQL: Amazon Redshift SQL Apache HiveQL and Beeline CLI IBM Netezza SQL and NZPLSQL Teradata and Teradata Vantage: SQL Basic Teradata Query (BTEQ) Teradata Parallel Transport (TPT) Additionally, translation of the following SQL dialects is supported in preview : Apache Impala SQL Apache Spark SQL Azure Synapse T-SQL GoogleSQL (BigQuery) Greenplum SQL IBM DB2 SQL MySQL SQL Oracle SQL, PL/SQL, Exadata PostgreSQL SQL Trino or PrestoSQL Snowflake SQL SQL Server T-SQL SQLite Vertica SQL Important: Translation is done on a best effort basis.
