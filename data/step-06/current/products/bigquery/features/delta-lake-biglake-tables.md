### "Introduction to BigLake external tables \_|\_ BigQuery \_|\_ Google Cloud\

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-5`
- Final score: 206
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- BigLake tables support the following formats: Avro CSV Delta Lake Iceberg JSON ORC Parquet You can't use cached metadata with Apache Iceberg external tables ; BigQuery already uses the metadata that Iceberg captures in manifest files.
- To find information about metadata refresh jobs, query the INFORMATION SCHEMA.JOBS view , as shown in the following example: SELECT FROM region-us.INFORMATION SCHEMA.JOBS BY PROJECT WHERE job id LIKE '%metadata cache refresh%' AND creation time > TIMESTAMP SUB ( CURRENT TIMESTAMP (), INTERVAL 6 HOUR ) ORDER BY start time DESC LIMIT 10 ; For Cloud Storage BigLake tables that are based on Parquet files, table statistics are collected during the metadata cache refresh and used to improve query plans.
- Supported data stores You can use BigLake tables with the following data stores: Amazon S3 by using BigQuery Omni Blob Storage by using BigQuery Omni Cloud Storage Temporary table support BigLake tables based on Cloud Storage can be temporary or permanent.
- Cache-enabled tables with materialized views You can use materialized views over BigLake metadata cache-enabled tables to improve performance and efficiency when querying structured data stored in Cloud Storage or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

Evidence snippets:
- Prior Iceberg releases For open source Iceberg releases prior to 1.10, you can configure standard OAuth authentication by configuring a session with the following: import pyspark from pyspark.context import SparkContext from pyspark.sql import SparkSession catalog name = " CATALOG NAME " spark = SparkSession . builder . appName ( " APP NAME " ) \ . config ( 'spark.jars.packages' , 'org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5 2.12:1.9.1,org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-gcp-bundle:1.9.1' ) \ . config ( f 'spark.sql.catalog. { catalog name } ' , 'org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog' ) \ . config ( f 'spark.sql.catalog. { catalog name } .type' , 'rest' ) \ . config ( f 'spark.sql.catalog. { catalog name } .uri' , 'https://biglake.googleapis.com/iceberg/v1/restcatalog' ) \ . config ( f 'spark.sql.catalog. { catalog name } .warehouse' , ' WAREHOUSE PATH ' ) \ . config ( f 'spark.sql.catalog. { catalog name } .header.x-goog-user-project' , ' PROJECT ID ' ) \ . config ( f "spark.sql.catalog. { catalog name } .token" , " TOKEN " ) \ . config ( f "spark.sql.catalog. { catalog name } .oauth2-server-uri" , "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token" ) \ . config ( f 'spark.sql.catalog. { catalog name } .io-impl' , 'org.apache.iceberg.gcp.gcs.GCSFileIO' ) \ . config ( f 'spark.sql.catalog. { catalog name } .rest-metrics-reporting-enabled' , 'false' ) \ . config ( 'spark.sql.extensions' , 'org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions' ) \ . config ( 'spark.sql.defaultCatalog' , ' CATALOG NAME ' ) \ . getOrCreate () Replace the following: CATALOG NAME : the name of your Iceberg REST catalog.
- Enable the API Required roles To get the permissions that you need to use the Iceberg REST catalog in BigLake metastore, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: Perform administrative tasks, such as managing catalog user access, storage access, and the catalog's credential vending mode: BigLake Admin ( roles/biglake.admin ) on the project Storage Admin ( roles/storage.admin ) on the Cloud Storage bucket Read table data in credential vending mode: BigLake Viewer ( roles/biglake.viewer ) on the project Write table data in credential vending mode: BigLake Editor ( roles/biglake.editor ) on the project Read catalog resources and table data in non-credential vending mode: BigLake Viewer ( roles/biglake.viewer ) on the project Storage Object Viewer ( roles/storage.objectViewer ) on the Cloud Storage bucket Manage catalog resources and write table data in non-credential vending mode: BigLake Editor ( roles/biglake.editor ) on the project Storage Object User ( roles/storage.objectUser ) on the Cloud Storage bucket Perform data manipulation language (DML) operations with BigQuery catalog federation: BigQuery Data Editor ( roles/bigquery.dataEditor ) on the project Storage Admin ( roles/storage.admin ) on the Cloud Storage bucket.
- Credential vending is a storage access delegation mechanism that lets BigLake metastore administrators control permissions directly on BigLake metastore resources, eliminating the need for catalog users to have direct access to Cloud Storage buckets.
- For managed BigLake tables for Apache Iceberg , this name often matches the Cloud Storage bucket ID used with the REST catalog—for example, if your bucket is gs://bucket-id , the catalog name might be bucket-id .
