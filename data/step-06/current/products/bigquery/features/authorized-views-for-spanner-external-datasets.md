- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-5`
- Final score: 154
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- A dataset's access control list can have up to 2,500 total authorized resources, including authorized views , authorized datasets , and authorized functions .
- Supports publishing a BigQuery dataset, called a shared dataset , and its associated authorized views and authorized datasets, to a set of subscribers.
- As a best practice, group related views into authorized datasets when you design new BigQuery architectures, especially multi-tenant architectures.
- If you exceed this limit due to a large number of authorized views, consider grouping the views into authorized datasets.

- NAME and VALUE must be one of the following combinations: NAME VALUE Details enable refresh BOOLEAN Example: enable refresh=false Default: true refresh interval minutes FLOAT64 Example: refresh interval minutes=20 Default: refresh interval minutes=30 expiration timestamp TIMESTAMP Example: expiration timestamp=TIMESTAMP "2025-01-01 00:00:00 UTC" This property is equivalent to the expirationTime table resource property. expiration timestamp is optional and not used by default. max staleness INTERVAL Example: max staleness=INTERVAL "4:0:0" HOUR TO SECOND The max staleness property provides consistently high performance with controlled costs when processing large, frequently changing datasets. max staleness is disabled by default. allow non incremental definition BOOLEAN Example: allow non incremental definition=true The allow non incremental definition property supports an expanded range of SQL queries to create materialized views. allow non incremental definition=true is disabled by default.

- Example The following example deletes the my cloud resource connection connection: DROP CONNECTION IF EXISTS us.my cloud resource connection ; Table path syntax Use the following syntax when specifying the path of a table resource , including standard tables, views, materialized views, external tables, and table snapshots. table path := [[ project name . ] dataset name . ] table name project name : The name of the project that contains the table resource.
- You can use DDL commands to create, alter, and delete resources, such as the following: Datasets Tables Table schemas Table clones Table snapshots Views Connections User-defined functions (UDFs) Indexes Capacity commitments and reservations Row-level access policies Default configuration settings Required permissions To create a job that runs a DDL statement, you must have the bigquery.jobs.create permission for the project where you are running the job.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-5`
- Final score: 143
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Copy datasets for multiregional configurations Because BigQuery disallows cross-regional queries, you can't use the strategy of segmenting data with authorized views when data marts must exist across multiple regions.
- Authorized views, authorized user-defined functions (UDFs) , and column policies are frequently used together to share data with lines of business while preventing accidental distribution of sensitive data.
- Authorized resources include authorized views, authorized datasets, and authorized functions.There are no limits on the number of datasets in a project or tables in a dataset.
- You maintain authorized views within datasets inside this project and grant authorized views to your analytics teams based on group membership.
