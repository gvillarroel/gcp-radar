Evidence snippets:
- For more information, see Set up authentication for client libraries . // Import the Google Cloud client library and create a client const { BigQuery } = require ( ' @google-cloud/bigquery ' ); const bigquery = new BigQuery (); async function ddlCreateView () { // Creates a view via a DDL query / TODO(developer): Uncomment the following lines before running the sample. / // const projectId = "my project" // const datasetId = "my dataset" // const tableId = "my new view" const query = CREATE VIEW \ ${ projectId } . ${ datasetId } . ${ tableId } \ OPTIONS( expiration timestamp=TIMESTAMP ADD( CURRENT TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 48 HOUR), friendly name="new view", description="a view that expires in 2 days", labels=[("org unit", "development")] ) AS SELECT name, state, year, number FROM \bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current\ WHERE state LIKE 'W%' ; // For all options, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/query const options = { query : query , }; // Run the query as a job const [ job ] = await bigquery . createQueryJob ( options ); job . on ( 'complete' , metadata = > { console . log ( Created new view ${ tableId } via job ${ metadata . id } ); }); } Python Call the Client.query() method to start a query job.
- Examples The following table function takes an INT64 parameter that is used to filter the results of a query: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example specifies the return TABLE type in the RETURNS clause: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) RETURNS TABLE<name STRING , year INT64 , total INT64 > AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example computes total sales for items with the name item name from the orders table: CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . compute sales ( orders TABLE<item STRING , sales INT64 > , item name STRING ) AS ( SELECT SUM ( sales ) AS total sales , item FROM orders WHERE item = item name GROUP BY item ); CREATE PROCEDURE statement Creates a new procedure , which is a block of statements that can be called from other queries.
- Cannot appear with main file uri in procedure option list . argument type : Any valid BigQuery type . procedure argument mode : Specifies whether an argument is an input, an output, or both. procedure option list The procedure option list lets you specify procedure options.
- Run DDL statements You can run DDL statements by using the Google Cloud console, by using the bq command-line tool, by calling the jobs.query REST API, or programmatically using the BigQuery API client libraries .
