- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- You can't use the following SQL capabilities in a continuous query, unless they are listed as a supported stateful operation : The following query operators: PIVOT UNPIVOT TABLESAMPLE Query set operators The SELECT DISTINCT statement EXISTS or NOT EXISTS subqueries Recursive CTEs User-defined functions Window function calls BigQuery ML functions other than those listed in Supported functionality Data definition language (DDL) statements Data manipulation language (DML) statements except for INSERT .
- Writes from the results of a batch query to a permanent table Writes from the results of a BigQuery continuous query to a permanent table A Pub/Sub BigQuery subscription Writes from Dataflow to BigQuery Writes from Datastream to BigQuery using append-only write mode You can use continuous queries to perform time-sensitive tasks, such as creating and immediately acting on insights, applying real-time machine learning (ML) inference, and replicating data into other platforms.
- Continuous queries can process data that has been written to standard BigQuery tables by using one of the following methods: The BigQuery Storage Write API The tabledata.insertAll method Batch load The INSERT DML statement Mutating data manipulation language (DML) statements such as DELETE , UPDATE , and MERGE when exporting data to Pub/Sub .
- Supported functionality The following operations are supported in continuous queries: Running INSERT statements to write data from a continuous query into a BigQuery table.

Evidence snippets:
- CURRENT TIMESTAMP () - INTERVAL 10 MINUTE ) WHERE CHANGE TYPE = 'DELETE' ); Export data to a Bigtable table The following example shows a continuous query that filters data from a BigQuery table that is receiving streaming taxi ride information, and exports the data into a Bigtable table in real time: EXPORT DATA OPTIONS ( format = 'CLOUD BIGTABLE' , truncate = TRUE , overwrite = TRUE , uri = 'https://bigtable.googleapis.com/projects/myproject/instances/mybigtableinstance/tables/taxi-real-time-rides' ) AS ( SELECT CAST ( CONCAT ( ride id , timestamp , latitude , longitude ) AS STRING ) AS rowkey , STRUCT ( timestamp , latitude , longitude , meter reading , ride status , passenger count ) AS features FROM APPENDS ( TABLE myproject.real time taxi streaming.taxirides , -- Configure the APPENDS TVF start timestamp to specify when you want to -- start processing data using your continuous query. -- This example starts processing at 10 minutes before the current time.
- Export data to a Pub/Sub topic The following example shows a continuous query that filters data from a BigQuery table that is receiving streaming taxi ride information, and publishes the data for cancelled rides to a Pub/Sub topic in real time with message attributes: EXPORT DATA OPTIONS ( format = 'CLOUD PUBSUB' , uri = 'https://pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/myproject/topics/taxi-real-time-rides' ) AS ( SELECT TO JSON STRING ( STRUCT ( ride id , timestamp , latitude , longitude )) AS message , TO JSON ( STRUCT ( CAST ( passenger comment AS STRING ) AS passenger comment )) FROM CHANGES ( TABLE myproject.real time taxi streaming.taxi rides , -- Configure the CHANGES TVF start timestamp to specify when you want to -- start processing data using your continuous query. -- This example starts processing at 10 minutes before the current time.
- FOR SYSTEM TIME AS OF '2025-01-01 00:00:00 UTC' WHERE ride status = 'dropoff' ; Run a continuous query from the point in time at which the query stopped: INSERT INTO myproject.real time taxi streaming.transformed taxirides SELECT timestamp , meter reading , ride status , passenger count , ST Distance ( ST GeogPoint ( pickup longitude , pickup latitude ), ST GeogPoint ( dropoff longitude , dropoff latitude )) AS euclidean trip distance , SAFE DIVIDE ( meter reading , passenger count ) AS cost per passenger FROM APPENDS ( TABLE myproject.real time taxi streaming.taxirides , -- Configure the APPENDS TVF start timestamp to start processing -- data right where the batch query left off + 1 microsecond. -- This timestamp must be within the time travel window.
- The following example shows how to start a continuous query from a particular point in time by using the APPENDS function, when querying a BigQuery table that is receiving streaming taxi ride information: EXPORT DATA OPTIONS ( format = 'CLOUD PUBSUB' , uri = 'https://pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/myproject/topics/taxi-real-time-rides' ) AS ( SELECT TO JSON STRING ( STRUCT ( ride id , timestamp , latitude , longitude )) AS message FROM APPENDS ( TABLE myproject.real time taxi streaming.taxirides , -- Configure the APPENDS TVF start timestamp to specify when you want to -- start processing data using your continuous query. -- This example starts processing at 10 minutes before the current time.

- Examples The following table function takes an INT64 parameter that is used to filter the results of a query: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example specifies the return TABLE type in the RETURNS clause: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) RETURNS TABLE<name STRING , year INT64 , total INT64 > AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example computes total sales for items with the name item name from the orders table: CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . compute sales ( orders TABLE<item STRING , sales INT64 > , item name STRING ) AS ( SELECT SUM ( sales ) AS total sales , item FROM orders WHERE item = item name GROUP BY item ); CREATE PROCEDURE statement Creates a new procedure , which is a block of statements that can be called from other queries.
