Evidence snippets:
- To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the Required permissions section: Required permissions The following permissions are required to view all data in the operational health and resource utilization charts: To view all data in the operational health and resource utilization charts for an organization: bigquery.jobs.listExecutionMetadata or bigquery.jobs.listAll on the organization bigquery.reservationAssignments.list on the administration project used to create the reservations bigquery.capacityCommitments.list on the administration project used to create the reservations As an on-demand user, to view all data in the resource utilization charts for an organization: bigquery.jobs.listExecutionMetadata or bigquery.jobs.listAll on the organization To view operational health summary data for BigQuery table storage: bigquery.tables.get or bigquery.tables.list on the organization To view operational health and resource utilization charts at the reservation level: bigquery.reservations.list on the administration project used to create the reservations bigquery.reservationAssignments.list on the administration project used to create the reservations To view resource utilization charts at the project level: bigquery.jobs.listAll on the project You might also be able to get these permissions with custom roles or other predefined roles .
- View project-level resource utilization data You can analyze project-level resource utilization using the same configuration steps as you would for viewing organization-level data.
- Required roles To get the permissions that you need to view all data in the operational health and resource utilization charts, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your organization: BigQuery Resource Viewer ( roles/bigquery.resourceViewer ) BigQuery Metadata Viewer ( roles/bigquery.metadataViewer ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- Note: Viewing all data in the operational health and resource utilization charts is only available if you have defined Google Cloud organizations.

Evidence snippets:
- To create a IAM deny policy for viewing dataset access controls, deny the following permissions: bigquery.datasets.get bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy To create a IAM deny policy for updating dataset access controls, deny the following permissions: bigquery.datasets.update bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy What's next Learn how to use the projects.testIamPermissions method to test user access to a resource.
- When you grant a role at the project level, the role and its permissions are inherited by the dataset and by the dataset's resources.
- Modify the policy to remove the desired role or principal, and then apply the updated policy using the Table#setIamPolicy() method. / TODO(developer): Update and un-comment below lines / // const projectId = "YOUR PROJECT ID" // const datasetId = "YOUR DATASET ID" // const tableId = "YOUR TABLE ID" // const roleToRemove = "YOUR ROLE" // const principalToRemove = "YOUR PRINCIPAL ID" const { BigQuery } = require ( ' @google-cloud/bigquery ' ); // Instantiate a client. const client = new BigQuery (); async function revokeAccessToTableOrView () { const dataset = client . dataset ( datasetId ); const table = dataset . table ( tableId ); // Get the IAM access policy for the table or view. const [ policy ] = await table . getIamPolicy (); // Initialize bindings array. if ( ! policy . bindings ) { policy . bindings = []; } // To revoke access to a table or view, // remove bindings from the Table or View policy. // // Find more details about Policy objects here: // https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/Shared.Types/Policy if ( principalToRemove ) { // Create a copy of bindings for modifications. const bindings = [... policy . bindings ]; // Filter out the principal from each binding. for ( const binding of bindings ) { if ( binding . members ) { binding . members = binding . members . filter ( m = > m !== principalToRemove ); } } // Filter out bindings with empty members. policy . bindings = bindings . filter ( binding = > binding . members && binding . members . length > 0 ); } if ( roleToRemove ) { // Filter out all bindings with the roleToRemove // and assign a new list back to the policy bindings. policy . bindings = policy . bindings . filter ( b = > b . role !== roleToRemove ); } // Set the IAM access policy with updated bindings. await table . setIamPolicy ( policy ); // Both role and principal are removed if ( roleToRemove !== null && principalToRemove !== null ) { console . log ( Role ' ${ roleToRemove } ' revoked for principal ' ${ principalToRemove } ' on resource ' ${ datasetId } . ${ tableId } '. ); } // Only role is removed if ( roleToRemove !== null && principalToRemove === null ) { console . log ( Role ' ${ roleToRemove } ' revoked for all principals on resource ' ${ datasetId } . ${ tableId } '. ); } // Only principal is removed if ( roleToRemove === null && principalToRemove !== null ) { console . log ( Access revoked for principal ' ${ principalToRemove } ' on resource ' ${ datasetId } . ${ tableId } '. ); } // No changes were made if ( roleToRemove === null && principalToRemove === null ) { console . log ( No changes made to access policy for ' ${ datasetId } . ${ tableId } '. ); } } Work with access controls for routines Preview This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms .
- Call the Table#getIamPolicy() function to retrieve the current IAM policy for a table or view, modify the policy by adding new bindings, and then use Table#setIamPolicy() function to save changes to the access policy. / TODO(developer): Update and un-comment below lines / // const projectId = "YOUR PROJECT ID"; // const datasetId = "YOUR DATASET ID"; // const tableId = "YOUR TABLE ID"; // const principalId = "YOUR PRINCIPAL ID"; // const role = "YOUR ROLE"; const { BigQuery } = require ( ' @google-cloud/bigquery ' ); // Instantiate a client. const client = new BigQuery (); async function grantAccessToTableOrView () { const dataset = client . dataset ( datasetId ); const table = dataset . table ( tableId ); // Get the IAM access policy for the table or view. const [ policy ] = await table . getIamPolicy (); // Initialize bindings array. if ( ! policy . bindings ) { policy . bindings = []; } // To grant access to a table or view // add bindings to the Table or View policy. // // Find more details about Policy and Binding objects here: // https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/Shared.Types/Policy // https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/Shared.Types/Binding const binding = { role , members : [ principalId ], }; policy . bindings . push ( binding ); // Set the IAM access policy with updated bindings. await table . setIamPolicy ( policy ); // Show a success message. console . log ( Role ' ${ role } ' granted for principal ' ${ principalId } ' on resource ' ${ datasetId } . ${ tableId } '. ); } await grantAccessToTableOrView (); Python Before trying this sample, follow the Python setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart using client libraries .
