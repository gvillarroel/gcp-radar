Evidence snippets:
- To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the Required permissions section: Required permissions The following permissions are required to modify IAM policies for resources: To get a dataset's access policy: bigquery.datasets.get To set a dataset's access policy: bigquery.datasets.update To get a dataset's access policy (Google Cloud console only): bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy To set a dataset's access policy (console only): bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy To get a table or view's policy: bigquery.tables.getIamPolicy To set a table or view's policy: bigquery.tables.setIamPolicy To get a routine's access policy: bigquery.routines.getIamPolicy To set a routine's access policy: bigquery.routines.setIamPolicy To create bq tool or SQL BigQuery jobs (optional): bigquery.jobs.create You might also be able to get these permissions with custom roles or other predefined roles .
- See the BigQuery client library documentation for more details on update dataset: https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client#google cloud bigquery client Client update dataset try : Update just the access entries property of the dataset. dataset = client . update dataset ( dataset , [ "access entries" ], ) Notify user that the API call was successful. full dataset id = f " { dataset . project } . { dataset . dataset id } " print ( f "Revoked dataset access for ' { entity id } ' to ' dataset ' { full dataset id } .'" ) except PreconditionFailed : # A read-modify-write error. print ( f "Dataset ' { dataset . dataset id } ' was modified remotely before this update. " "Fetch the latest version and retry." ) Work with table and view access controls Views are treated as table resources in BigQuery.
- This capability implies that the authorized resources have the following permissions: bigquery.tables.get bigquery.tables.list bigquery.tables.getData bigquery.tables.updateData bigquery.tables.create bigquery.tables.delete bigquery.routines.get bigquery.routines.list bigquery.datasets.get bigquery.models.getData bigquery.models.getMetadata To deny access to these authorized resources, add one of the following values to the deniedPrincipal field when you create the deny policy: Value Use case principalSet://goog/public:all Blocks all principals including authorized resources. principalSet://bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT NUMBER / Blocks all BigQuery authorized resources in the specified project.
- Find more details about Policy and Binding objects here: https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/Shared.Types/Policy https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/reference/rest/Shared.Types/Binding binding = { "role" : role , "members" : [ principal id , ], } policy . bindings . append ( binding ) Set the IAM access policy with updated bindings. updated policy = client . set iam policy ( full resource name , policy ) Show a success message. print ( f "Role ' { role } ' granted for principal ' { principal id } '" f " on resource ' { full resource name } '." ) Predefined roles that grant access to tables and views Views are treated as table resources in BigQuery.

Evidence snippets:
- Each metric has the following default settings, which you can edit in the Chart configuration pane by clicking the metric's name: The default usage data is from the reservation resources.
- To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the Required permissions section: Required permissions The following permissions are required to view all data in the operational health and resource utilization charts: To view all data in the operational health and resource utilization charts for an organization: bigquery.jobs.listExecutionMetadata or bigquery.jobs.listAll on the organization bigquery.reservationAssignments.list on the administration project used to create the reservations bigquery.capacityCommitments.list on the administration project used to create the reservations As an on-demand user, to view all data in the resource utilization charts for an organization: bigquery.jobs.listExecutionMetadata or bigquery.jobs.listAll on the organization To view operational health summary data for BigQuery table storage: bigquery.tables.get or bigquery.tables.list on the organization To view operational health and resource utilization charts at the reservation level: bigquery.reservations.list on the administration project used to create the reservations bigquery.reservationAssignments.list on the administration project used to create the reservations To view resource utilization charts at the project level: bigquery.jobs.listAll on the project You might also be able to get these permissions with custom roles or other predefined roles .
- Required roles To get the permissions that you need to view all data in the operational health and resource utilization charts, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your organization: BigQuery Resource Viewer ( roles/bigquery.resourceViewer ) BigQuery Metadata Viewer ( roles/bigquery.metadataViewer ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- BigQuery gathers the metrics by querying the following INFORMATION SCHEMA views : INFORMATION SCHEMA.JOBS INFORMATION SCHEMA.JOBS TIMELINE INFORMATION SCHEMA.RESERVATIONS INFORMATION SCHEMA.TABLE STORAGE For an example query that replicates the slot usage timeline chart found in administrative resource charts, see Match slot usage behavior from administrative resource charts .
