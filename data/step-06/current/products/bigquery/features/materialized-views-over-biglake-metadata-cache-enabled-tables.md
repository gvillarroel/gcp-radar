Evidence snippets:
- Cache-enabled tables with materialized views You can use materialized views over BigLake metadata cache-enabled tables to improve performance and efficiency when querying structured data stored in Cloud Storage or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
- To find information about metadata refresh jobs, query the INFORMATION SCHEMA.JOBS view , as shown in the following example: SELECT FROM region-us.INFORMATION SCHEMA.JOBS BY PROJECT WHERE job id LIKE '%metadata cache refresh%' AND creation time > TIMESTAMP SUB ( CURRENT TIMESTAMP (), INTERVAL 6 HOUR ) ORDER BY start time DESC LIMIT 10 ; For Cloud Storage BigLake tables that are based on Parquet files, table statistics are collected during the metadata cache refresh and used to improve query plans.
- BigLake tables support the following formats: Avro CSV Delta Lake Iceberg JSON ORC Parquet You can't use cached metadata with Apache Iceberg external tables ; BigQuery already uses the metadata that Iceberg captures in manifest files.
- If you use cached metadata , then the following limitations apply: You can only use cached metadata with BigLake tables that use Avro, ORC, Parquet, JSON, and CSV formats.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The INFORMATION SCHEMA.TABLE OPTIONS view has the following schema: Column name Data type Value table catalog STRING The project ID of the project that contains the dataset table schema STRING The name of the dataset that contains the table or view also referred to as the datasetId table name STRING The name of the table or view also referred to as the tableId option name STRING One of the name values in the options table option type STRING One of the data type values in the options table option value STRING One of the value options in the options table Options table OPTION NAME OPTION TYPE OPTION VALUE description STRING A description of the table enable refresh BOOL Whether automatic refresh is enabled for a materialized view expiration timestamp TIMESTAMP The time when this table expires friendly name STRING The table's descriptive name kms key name STRING The name of the Cloud KMS key used to encrypt the table labels ARRAY<STRUCT<STRING, STRING>> An array of STRUCT 's that represent the labels on the table max staleness INTERVAL The configured table's maximum staleness for BigQuery change data capture (CDC) upserts partition expiration days FLOAT64 The default lifetime, in days, of all partitions in a partitioned table refresh interval minutes FLOAT64 How frequently a materialized view is refreshed require partition filter BOOL Whether queries over the table require a partition filter tags ARRAY<STRUCT<STRING, STRING>> Tags attached to a table in a namespaced <key, value> syntax.
- Applicable only to tables with table type set to CLONE or SNAPSHOT . replica source catalog STRING For materialized view replicas , the base materialized view's project. replica source schema STRING For materialized view replicas , the base materialized view's dataset. replica source name STRING For materialized view replicas , the base materialized view's name. replication status STRING For materialized view replicas , the status of the replication from the base materialized view to the materialized view replica; one of the following: REPLICATION STATUS UNSPECIFIED ACTIVE : Replication is active with no errors SOURCE DELETED : The source materialized view has been deleted PERMISSION DENIED : The source materialized view hasn't been authorized on the dataset that contains the source Amazon S3 BigLake tables used in the query that created the materialized view.
- To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the Required permissions section: Required permissions The following permissions are required to create a table: bigquery.tables.create on the dataset where you're creating the table. bigquery.tables.getData on all tables and views that your query references if you're saving query results as a table. bigquery.jobs.create on the project if you're creating the table by loading data or by saving query results to a table. bigquery.tables.updateData on the table if you're appending to or overwriting a table with query results.
- View table properties print ( "Got table ' {} . {} . {} '." . format ( table . project , table . dataset id , table . table id ) ) print ( "Table schema: {} " . format ( table . schema )) print ( "Table description: {} " . format ( table . description )) print ( "Table has {} rows" . format ( table . num rows )) Get table information using INFORMATION SCHEMA INFORMATION SCHEMA is a series of views that provide access to metadata about datasets, routines, tables, views, jobs, reservations, and streaming data.

Evidence snippets:
- For more information about using the bq update command, see the following: Updating dataset properties Managing tables Updating views Updating labels Working with transfers Updating table snapshot metadata bq version Use the bq version command to display the version number of your bq command-line tool.
- If you supply the --time partitioning expiration flag when you create or update a partitioned table, then the table-level partition expiration takes precedence over the dataset-level default partition expiration. --default table expiration= SECONDS An integer that specifies the default lifetime, in seconds, for newly created tables in a dataset.
- For example: --external table definition=/tmp/tabledef --external table definition=Region:STRING,Quarter:STRING,Total sales:INTEGER@CSV=gs://mybucket/sales.csv For Bigtable external tables , and BigLake tables based on AWS and Azure : --external table definition= PATH TO FILE The value must be a path to a file containing a table definition .
- Note: To remove all rows from a table without deleting the schema, use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement. --require cache={true false} If specified, then run the query only if results can be retrieved from the cache. --require partition filter={true false} If specified, then a partition filter is required for queries over the supplied table.
