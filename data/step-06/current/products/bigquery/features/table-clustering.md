- Defaults to 1. clustering column list CLUSTER BY is an optional clause that controls table clustering . clustering column list is a comma-separated list that determines how to cluster the table.

- CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS myproject . mydataset . new mv OPTIONS ( expiration timestamp = TIMESTAMP ADD ( CURRENT TIMESTAMP (), INTERVAL 48 HOUR ), friendly name = "new mv" , description = "a view that expires in 2 days" , labels =[ ( "org unit" , "development" ) ] , enable refresh = false ) AS SELECT column 1 , column 2 , column 3 FROM myproject.mydataset.mytable The materialized view is defined using the following GoogleSQL query: SELECT column 1, column 2, column 3 FROM myproject.mydataset.mytable The materialized view option list specifies the: Expiration time: 48 hours from the time the view is created Friendly name: new mv Description: A view that expires in 2 days Label: org unit = development Refresh enabled: false Creating a materialized view with partitioning and clustering The following example creates a materialized view named new mv in mydataset , partitioned by the col datetime column and clustered by the col int column: CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myproject . mydataset . new mv PARTITION BY DATE ( col datetime ) CLUSTER BY col int AS SELECT col int , col datetime , COUNT ( 1 ) as cnt FROM myproject . mydataset . mv base table GROUP BY col int , col datetime The base table, mv base table , must also be partitioned by the col datetime column.
