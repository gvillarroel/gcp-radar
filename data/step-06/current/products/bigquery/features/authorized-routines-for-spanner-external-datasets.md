- The location must support the kind of federated dataset that you are creating, for example, you can only create AWS Glue federated datasets in AWS locations. external source STRING The source of the external dataset.
- For example, the default location is used if the query doesn't contain references to any datasets or connections.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-5`
- Final score: 146
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- The following types of routines can be authorized: Table functions User-defined functions (UDFs) Stored procedures Caution: Stored procedures authorized as routines have DDL and DML access.
- Authorized routines Authorized routines let you share query results with specific users or groups without giving them access to the underlying tables that generated the results.
- In the Authorized routines page, in the Authorize routine section, select the Project , Dataset , and Routine for the routine that you want to authorize.
- To update the entries immediately, you must manually delete the entry from the 'Currently authorized routines' list before re-authorizing it.

Evidence snippets:
- This capability implies that the authorized resources have the following permissions: bigquery.tables.get bigquery.tables.list bigquery.tables.getData bigquery.tables.updateData bigquery.tables.create bigquery.tables.delete bigquery.routines.get bigquery.routines.list bigquery.datasets.get bigquery.models.getData bigquery.models.getMetadata To deny access to these authorized resources, add one of the following values to the deniedPrincipal field when you create the deny policy: Value Use case principalSet://goog/public:all Blocks all principals including authorized resources. principalSet://bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT NUMBER / Blocks all BigQuery authorized resources in the specified project.
- Special cases Consider the following scenarios when you create IAM deny policies on a few BigQuery permissions: Access to authorized resources ( views , routines , datasets , or stored procedures ) lets you create , drop , or manipulate a table, along with reading and modifying table data, even if you don't have direct permission to perform those operations.
- Routines inside external or linked datasets don't support access controls.
- Modify the access property to exclude the desired entity, and then call the Dataset#setMetadata() function to apply the updated access list. / TODO(developer): Update and un-comment below lines / // const datasetId = "my project id.my dataset" // ID of the user or group from whom you are revoking access. // const entityId = "user-or-group-to-remove@example.com" const { BigQuery } = require ( '@google-cloud/bigquery' ); // Instantiate a client. const bigquery = new BigQuery (); async function revokeDatasetAccess () { const [ dataset ] = await bigquery . dataset ( datasetId ). get (); // To revoke access to a dataset, remove elements from the access list. // // See the BigQuery client library documentation for more details on access entries: // https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/reference/bigquery/latest // Filter access entries to exclude entries matching the specified entity id // and assign a new list back to the access list. dataset . metadata . access = dataset . metadata . access . filter ( entry = > { return ! ( entry . entity id === entityId entry . userByEmail === entityId entry . groupByEmail === entityId ); }); // Update will only succeed if the dataset // has not been modified externally since retrieval. // // See the BigQuery client library documentation for more details on metadata updates: // https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/updating-datasets // Update just the 'access entries' property of the dataset. await dataset . setMetadata ( dataset . metadata ); console . log ( Revoked access to ' ${ entityId } ' from ' ${ datasetId } '. ); } Python Before trying this sample, follow the Python setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart using client libraries .
