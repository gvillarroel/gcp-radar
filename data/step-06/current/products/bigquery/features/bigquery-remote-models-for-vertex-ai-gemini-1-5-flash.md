# BigQuery remote models for Vertex AI Gemini 1.5 Flash

Product: BigQuery
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

BigQuery ML now allows creating remote models based on the Vertex AI Gemini 1.5 Flash foundation model.

## Extended Definition

BigQuery ML supports creating a remote model by using `CREATE MODEL ... REMOTE`, which points to a hosted Vertex AI model via a Vertex AI connection/endpoint in `OPTIONS`, enabling BigQuery to send requests to that external model. After creation, the remote model can be used for inference from BigQuery queries with functions such as `ML.PREDICT` and `AI.GENERATE_TEXT` in common text-analysis tutorials.

## Evidence Summary

These official BigQuery pages confirm the remote-model creation flow, Vertex AI backing, and usage patterns, but the snippets provided do not directly verify the exact `Gemini 1.5 Flash` variant.
