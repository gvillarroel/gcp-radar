Evidence snippets:
- Writes from the results of a batch query to a permanent table Writes from the results of a BigQuery continuous query to a permanent table A Pub/Sub BigQuery subscription Writes from Dataflow to BigQuery Writes from Datastream to BigQuery using append-only write mode You can use continuous queries to perform time-sensitive tasks, such as creating and immediately acting on insights, applying real-time machine learning (ML) inference, and replicating data into other platforms.
- Continuous queries let you analyze incoming data in BigQuery in real time.
- Autonomous agent monitoring : develop real-time automated monitoring and alerting for real-time agentic interactions using the BigQuery agent analytics plugin , which streams all agent trace data, tool usage, and operational logs directly into BigQuery for deep observability into your AI workforce.
- Data enrichment and entity extraction : use continuous queries to perform real-time data enrichment and transformation by using SQL functions and ML models.

Evidence snippets:
- CURRENT TIMESTAMP () - INTERVAL 10 MINUTE ) WHERE ride status = 'enroute' ); Export data to a Spanner table The following example shows a continuous query that filters data from a BigQuery table that is receiving streaming taxi ride information, and then exports the data into a Spanner table in real time: EXPORT DATA OPTIONS ( format = 'CLOUD SPANNER' , uri = 'https://spanner.googleapis.com/projects/myproject/instances/myspannerinstance/databases/taxi-real-time-rides' , spanner options = " "" { " table ": " rides ", -- To ensure data is written to Spanner in the correct sequence -- during a continuous export, use the change timestamp column -- option.
- Continuous queries let you analyze incoming data in BigQuery in real time, and then either export the results to Bigtable, Pub/Sub, or Spanner, or write the results to a BigQuery table.
- CURRENT TIMESTAMP () - INTERVAL 10 MINUTE ) WHERE CHANGE TYPE = 'DELETE' ); Export data to a Bigtable table The following example shows a continuous query that filters data from a BigQuery table that is receiving streaming taxi ride information, and exports the data into a Bigtable table in real time: EXPORT DATA OPTIONS ( format = 'CLOUD BIGTABLE' , truncate = TRUE , overwrite = TRUE , uri = 'https://bigtable.googleapis.com/projects/myproject/instances/mybigtableinstance/tables/taxi-real-time-rides' ) AS ( SELECT CAST ( CONCAT ( ride id , timestamp , latitude , longitude ) AS STRING ) AS rowkey , STRUCT ( timestamp , latitude , longitude , meter reading , ride status , passenger count ) AS features FROM APPENDS ( TABLE myproject.real time taxi streaming.taxirides , -- Configure the APPENDS TVF start timestamp to specify when you want to -- start processing data using your continuous query. -- This example starts processing at 10 minutes before the current time.
- Export data to a Pub/Sub topic The following example shows a continuous query that filters data from a BigQuery table that is receiving streaming taxi ride information, and publishes the data for cancelled rides to a Pub/Sub topic in real time with message attributes: EXPORT DATA OPTIONS ( format = 'CLOUD PUBSUB' , uri = 'https://pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/myproject/topics/taxi-real-time-rides' ) AS ( SELECT TO JSON STRING ( STRUCT ( ride id , timestamp , latitude , longitude )) AS message , TO JSON ( STRUCT ( CAST ( passenger comment AS STRING ) AS passenger comment )) FROM CHANGES ( TABLE myproject.real time taxi streaming.taxi rides , -- Configure the CHANGES TVF start timestamp to specify when you want to -- start processing data using your continuous query. -- This example starts processing at 10 minutes before the current time.
