Evidence snippets:
- Go to BigQuery In the query editor, run the following query: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW bqml tutorial.input data AS SELECT age , workclass , marital status , education num , occupation , hours per week , income bracket , CASE WHEN MOD ( functional weight , 10 ) 8 THEN 'training' WHEN MOD ( functional weight , 10 ) = 8 THEN 'evaluation' WHEN MOD ( functional weight , 10 ) = 9 THEN 'prediction' END AS dataframe FROM bigquery-public-data.ml datasets.census adult income ; In the left pane, click explore Explorer : If you don't see the left pane, click last page Expand left pane to open the pane.
- For more information, see Set up ADC for a local development environment . import bigframes.pandas as bpd input data = bpd . read gbq ( "bigquery-public-data.ml datasets.census adult income" , columns = ( "age" , "workclass" , "marital status" , "education num" , "occupation" , "hours per week" , "income bracket" , "functional weight" , ), ) input data [ "dataframe" ] = bpd .
- This tutorial uses the bigquery-public-data.ml datasets.census adult income dataset.
- Create a dataset named bqml tutorial with the data location set to US . bq mk --dataset \ --location=US \ --description "BigQuery ML tutorial dataset." \ bqml tutorial Confirm that the dataset was created: bq ls API Call the datasets.insert method with a defined dataset resource . { "datasetReference" : { "datasetId" : "bqml tutorial" } } BigQuery DataFrames Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames setup instructions in the BigQuery quickstart using BigQuery DataFrames .

Evidence snippets:
- You can use DDL commands to create, alter, and delete resources, such as the following: Datasets Tables Table schemas Table clones Table snapshots Views Connections User-defined functions (UDFs) Indexes Capacity commitments and reservations Row-level access policies Default configuration settings Required permissions To create a job that runs a DDL statement, you must have the bigquery.jobs.create permission for the project where you are running the job.
- For more information, see Set up authentication for client libraries . // Import the Google Cloud client library and create a client const { BigQuery } = require ( ' @google-cloud/bigquery ' ); const bigquery = new BigQuery (); async function ddlCreateView () { // Creates a view via a DDL query / TODO(developer): Uncomment the following lines before running the sample. / // const projectId = "my project" // const datasetId = "my dataset" // const tableId = "my new view" const query = CREATE VIEW \ ${ projectId } . ${ datasetId } . ${ tableId } \ OPTIONS( expiration timestamp=TIMESTAMP ADD( CURRENT TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 48 HOUR), friendly name="new view", description="a view that expires in 2 days", labels=[("org unit", "development")] ) AS SELECT name, state, year, number FROM \bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current\ WHERE state LIKE 'W%' ; // For all options, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/query const options = { query : query , }; // Run the query as a job const [ job ] = await bigquery . createQueryJob ( options ); job . on ( 'complete' , metadata = > { console . log ( Created new view ${ tableId } via job ${ metadata . id } ); }); } Python Call the Client.query() method to start a query job.
- The table schema contains 2 columns: transaction id: An integer transaction date: A date The table option list specifies the: Partition expiration: Three days Description: A table partitioned by transaction date Creating a partitioned table from the result of a query The following example creates a partitioned table named days with rain in mydataset using a DATE column: CREATE TABLE mydataset . days with rain PARTITION BY date OPTIONS ( partition expiration days = 365 , description = "weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day" ) AS SELECT DATE ( CAST ( year AS INT64 ), CAST ( mo AS INT64 ), CAST ( da AS INT64 )) AS date , ( SELECT ANY VALUE ( name ) FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.stations AS stations WHERE stations . usaf = stn ) AS station name , -- Stations can have multiple names prcp FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod2017 AS weather WHERE prcp != 99.9 -- Filter unknown values AND prcp > 0 -- Filter stations/days with no precipitation If you haven't configured a default project, prepend a project ID to the dataset name in the example SQL, and enclose the name in backticks if project id contains special characters: project id.dataset.table .
- Examples The following table function takes an INT64 parameter that is used to filter the results of a query: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example specifies the return TABLE type in the RETURNS clause: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) RETURNS TABLE<name STRING , year INT64 , total INT64 > AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example computes total sales for items with the name item name from the orders table: CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . compute sales ( orders TABLE<item STRING , sales INT64 > , item name STRING ) AS ( SELECT SUM ( sales ) AS total sales , item FROM orders WHERE item = item name GROUP BY item ); CREATE PROCEDURE statement Creates a new procedure , which is a block of statements that can be called from other queries.
