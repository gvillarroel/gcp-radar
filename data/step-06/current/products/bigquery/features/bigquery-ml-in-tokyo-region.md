### BigQuery locations \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 64
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Tokyo/asia-northeast1 appears in location listings and the page has a BigQuery ML location section, but it does not explicitly state ML feature rollout wording.

Evidence snippets:
- Dual-region bucket : If your BigQuery dataset is in the Tokyo ( asia-northeast1 ) region, the corresponding Cloud Storage bucket must be in the Tokyo region, or in a dual-region that includes Tokyo, like the ASIA1 dual-region.
- For example, if your BigQuery dataset is in the asia-northeast1 (Tokyo) region, your Bigtable cluster must also be in the asia-northeast1 (Tokyo) region.
