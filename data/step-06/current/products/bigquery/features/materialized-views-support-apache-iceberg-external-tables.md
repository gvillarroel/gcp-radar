# Materialized views support Apache Iceberg external tables

Product: BigQuery
Coverage: HIGH

## Step 02 Summary

BigQuery now allows materialized views to reference Apache Iceberg external tables without migration to BigQuery-managed storage.

## Extended Definition

BigQuery materialized views now support Apache Iceberg external tables as a source, allowing a materialized view query to reference Iceberg external table data directly without migrating that data into BigQuery-managed storage. This capability was introduced in the June 09, 2025 BigQuery release notes.

## Evidence Summary

The BigQuery release notes explicitly record the feature addition that materialized views can reference Apache Iceberg external tables instead of requiring migration to BigQuery-managed storage.
