- For example: -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS and CUBE WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , CUBE ( product type , product name )) ORDER BY product type , product name ; / --------------+--------------+-------------+ product type product name product sum +--------------+--------------+-------------+ NULL NULL 42 NULL jeans 6 NULL polo 25 NULL t-shirt 11 pants NULL 6 pants NULL 6 pants jeans 6 shirt NULL 36 shirt NULL 36 shirt polo 25 shirt t-shirt 11 +--------------+--------------+------------- / -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS, but without CUBE -- (produces the same results as GROUPING SETS with CUBE) WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , ( product type , product name ), product type , product name , ()) ORDER BY product type , product name ; Group rows by ROLLUP GROUP BY ROLLUP ( grouping list ) grouping list : { groupable item groupable item set }[, ...] groupable item set : ( groupable item [, ...] ) Description The GROUP BY ROLLUP clause produces aggregated data for rolled up grouping sets .
- Examples The following queries produce the same subtotals and a grand total, but the first one uses GROUP BY with ROLLUP and the second one doesn't: -- GROUP BY with ROLLUP WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY ROLLUP ( product type , product name ) ORDER BY product type , product name ; / --------------+--------------+-------------+ product type product name product sum +--------------+--------------+-------------+ NULL NULL 42 pants NULL 6 pants jeans 6 shirt NULL 36 shirt t-shirt 11 shirt polo 25 +--------------+--------------+------------- / -- GROUP BY without ROLLUP (produces the same results as ROLLUP) WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY product type , product name UNION ALL SELECT product type , NULL , SUM ( product count ) FROM Products GROUP BY product type UNION ALL SELECT NULL , NULL , SUM ( product count ) FROM Products ORDER BY product type , product name ; You can include groupable item sets in a GROUP BY ROLLUP clause.
- In the example below, (product type, product name) is a groupable item set. -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS and a groupable item set WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , ( product type , product name )) ORDER BY product type , product name ; / --------------+--------------+-------------+ product type product name product sum +--------------+--------------+-------------+ pants NULL 6 pants jeans 6 shirt NULL 36 shirt polo 25 shirt t-shirt 11 +--------------+--------------+------------- / -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS but without a groupable item set -- (produces the same results as GROUPING SETS with a groupable item set) WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , NULL , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY product type UNION ALL SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY product type , product name ORDER BY product type , product name ; You can include ROLLUP in a GROUP BY GROUPING SETS clause.
- For example: -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS and ROLLUP WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , ROLLUP ( product type , product name )) ORDER BY product type , product name ; / --------------+--------------+-------------+ product type product name product sum +--------------+--------------+-------------+ NULL NULL 42 pants NULL 6 pants NULL 6 pants jeans 6 shirt NULL 36 shirt NULL 36 shirt polo 25 shirt t-shirt 11 +--------------+--------------+------------- / -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS, but without ROLLUP -- (produces the same results as GROUPING SETS with ROLLUP) WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , ( product type , product name ), product type , ()) ORDER BY product type , product name ; You can include CUBE in a GROUP BY GROUPING SETS clause.

Evidence snippets:
- Example This query adds the GROUPING function to the previous example to better identify the rows added because of the ROLLUP function. legacySQL SELECT year , GROUPING ( year ) as rollup year , is male , GROUPING ( is male ) as rollup gender , COUNT ( 1 ) as count FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE year > = 2000 AND year < = 2002 GROUP BY ROLLUP ( year , is male ) ORDER BY year , is male ; These are the result the new query returns. +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ year rollup year is male rollup gender count +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ NULL 1 NULL 1 12122730 2000 0 NULL 1 4063823 2000 0 false 0 1984255 2000 0 true 0 2079568 2001 0 NULL 1 4031531 2001 0 false 0 1970770 2001 0 true 0 2060761 2002 0 NULL 1 4027376 2002 0 false 0 1966519 2002 0 true 0 2060857 +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ Notes: Non-aggregated fields in the SELECT clause must be listed in the GROUP BY clause. legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word , corpus ; / Succeeds because all non-aggregated fields are group keys. / legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word ; / Fails because corpus is not aggregated nor is it a group key. / Expressions computed in the SELECT clause cannot be used in the corresponding GROUP BY clause. legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) word count FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word , corpus , word count ; / Fails because word count is not visible to this GROUP BY clause. / Grouping by float and double values is not supported, because the equality function for those types is not well-defined.
- Example: legacySQL SELECT cigarette use , / Finds average and standard deviation / AVG ( weight pounds ) baby weight , STDDEV ( weight pounds ) baby weight stdev , AVG ( mother age ) mother age FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE year = 2003 AND state = 'OH' / Group the result values by those / / who smoked and those who didn't. / GROUP BY cigarette use ; Filter query results using an aggregated value In order to filter query results using an aggregated value (for example, filtering by the value of a SUM ), use the HAVING function.
- Example This query generates per-year counts of male and female births from the sample natality dataset. legacySQL SELECT year , is male , COUNT ( 1 ) as count FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE year > = 2000 AND year < = 2002 GROUP BY ROLLUP ( year , is male ) ORDER BY year , is male ; These are the results of the query.
- If the state does not appear as an option in one of the WHEN statements, the state value will default to "None." Example: legacySQL SELECT CASE WHEN state IN ( 'WA' , 'OR' , 'CA' , 'AK' , 'HI' , 'ID' , 'MT' , 'WY' , 'NV' , 'UT' , 'CO' , 'AZ' , 'NM' ) THEN 'West' WHEN state IN ( 'OK' , 'TX' , 'AR' , 'LA' , 'TN' , 'MS' , 'AL' , 'KY' , 'GA' , 'FL' , 'SC' , 'NC' , 'VA' , 'WV' , 'MD' , 'DC' , 'DE' ) THEN 'South' WHEN state IN ( 'ND' , 'SD' , 'NE' , 'KS' , 'MN' , 'IA' , 'MO' , 'WI' , 'IL' , 'IN' , 'MI' , 'OH' ) THEN 'Midwest' WHEN state IN ( 'NY' , 'PA' , 'NJ' , 'CT' , 'RI' , 'MA' , 'VT' , 'NH' , 'ME' ) THEN 'Northeast' ELSE 'None' END as region , average mother age , average father age , state , year FROM ( SELECT year , state , SUM ( mother age ) / COUNT ( mother age ) as average mother age , SUM ( father age ) / COUNT ( father age ) as average father age FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE father age < 99 GROUP BY year , state ) ORDER BY year LIMIT 5 ; Returns: +--------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+------+ region average mother age average father age state year +--------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+------+ South 24.342600163532296 27.683769419460344 AR 1969 West 25.185041908446163 28.268214055448098 AK 1969 West 24.780776677578217 27.831181063905248 CA 1969 West 25.005834769924412 27.942978384829598 AZ 1969 South 24.541730952905738 27.686430093306885 AL 1969 +--------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+------+ Simulating a Pivot Table Use conditional statements to organize the results of a subselect query into rows and columns.

Evidence snippets:
- Examples The following table function takes an INT64 parameter that is used to filter the results of a query: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example specifies the return TABLE type in the RETURNS clause: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) RETURNS TABLE<name STRING , year INT64 , total INT64 > AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example computes total sales for items with the name item name from the orders table: CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . compute sales ( orders TABLE<item STRING , sales INT64 > , item name STRING ) AS ( SELECT SUM ( sales ) AS total sales , item FROM orders WHERE item = item name GROUP BY item ); CREATE PROCEDURE statement Creates a new procedure , which is a block of statements that can be called from other queries.
- The table option list specifies the: Table expiration time: January 1, 2025 at 00:00:00 UTC Partition expiration time: 1 day Description: A table that expires in 2025 Label: org unit = development Creating a new table from an existing table The following example creates a table named top words in mydataset from a query: CREATE TABLE mydataset . top words OPTIONS ( description = "Top ten words per Shakespeare corpus" ) AS SELECT corpus , ARRAY AGG ( STRUCT ( word , word count ) ORDER BY word count DESC LIMIT 10 ) AS top words FROM bigquery - public - data . samples . shakespeare GROUP BY corpus ; If you haven't configured a default project, prepend a project ID to the dataset name in the example SQL, and enclose the name in backticks if project id contains special characters: project id.dataset.table .
- BigQuery supports stored procedures for Apache Spark that are written in Python, Java, or Scala. pyspark code : The PySpark code for the stored procedure for Apache Spark if you want to pass the body of the procedure inline.
- BigQuery only supports unenforced primary keys. foreign key : An expression that defines a foreign key table constraint .
