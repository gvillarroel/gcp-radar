- Re-rank rationale: GROUP BY syntax is defined on the page, offering contextual support for ROLLUP-capable GROUP BY grammar.

Evidence snippets:
- For example: -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS and CUBE WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , CUBE ( product type , product name )) ORDER BY product type , product name ; / --------------+--------------+-------------+ product type product name product sum +--------------+--------------+-------------+ NULL NULL 42 NULL jeans 6 NULL polo 25 NULL t-shirt 11 pants NULL 6 pants NULL 6 pants jeans 6 shirt NULL 36 shirt NULL 36 shirt polo 25 shirt t-shirt 11 +--------------+--------------+------------- / -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS, but without CUBE -- (produces the same results as GROUPING SETS with CUBE) WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , ( product type , product name ), product type , product name , ()) ORDER BY product type , product name ; Group rows by ROLLUP GROUP BY ROLLUP ( grouping list ) grouping list : { groupable item groupable item set }[, ...] groupable item set : ( groupable item [, ...] ) Description The GROUP BY ROLLUP clause produces aggregated data for rolled up grouping sets .
- Examples The following queries produce the same subtotals and a grand total, but the first one uses GROUP BY with ROLLUP and the second one doesn't: -- GROUP BY with ROLLUP WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY ROLLUP ( product type , product name ) ORDER BY product type , product name ; / --------------+--------------+-------------+ product type product name product sum +--------------+--------------+-------------+ NULL NULL 42 pants NULL 6 pants jeans 6 shirt NULL 36 shirt t-shirt 11 shirt polo 25 +--------------+--------------+------------- / -- GROUP BY without ROLLUP (produces the same results as ROLLUP) WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY product type , product name UNION ALL SELECT product type , NULL , SUM ( product count ) FROM Products GROUP BY product type UNION ALL SELECT NULL , NULL , SUM ( product count ) FROM Products ORDER BY product type , product name ; You can include groupable item sets in a GROUP BY ROLLUP clause.
- To learn more, see Group rows by GROUPING SETS . rollup specification : Group rows with the GROUP BY ROLLUP clause.
- In the example below, (product type, product name) is a groupable item set. -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS and a groupable item set WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , ( product type , product name )) ORDER BY product type , product name ; / --------------+--------------+-------------+ product type product name product sum +--------------+--------------+-------------+ pants NULL 6 pants jeans 6 shirt NULL 36 shirt polo 25 shirt t-shirt 11 +--------------+--------------+------------- / -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS but without a groupable item set -- (produces the same results as GROUPING SETS with a groupable item set) WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , NULL , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY product type UNION ALL SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY product type , product name ORDER BY product type , product name ; You can include ROLLUP in a GROUP BY GROUPING SETS clause.

Evidence snippets:
- Example This query adds the GROUPING function to the previous example to better identify the rows added because of the ROLLUP function. legacySQL SELECT year , GROUPING ( year ) as rollup year , is male , GROUPING ( is male ) as rollup gender , COUNT ( 1 ) as count FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE year > = 2000 AND year < = 2002 GROUP BY ROLLUP ( year , is male ) ORDER BY year , is male ; These are the result the new query returns. +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ year rollup year is male rollup gender count +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ NULL 1 NULL 1 12122730 2000 0 NULL 1 4063823 2000 0 false 0 1984255 2000 0 true 0 2079568 2001 0 NULL 1 4031531 2001 0 false 0 1970770 2001 0 true 0 2060761 2002 0 NULL 1 4027376 2002 0 false 0 1966519 2002 0 true 0 2060857 +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ Notes: Non-aggregated fields in the SELECT clause must be listed in the GROUP BY clause. legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word , corpus ; / Succeeds because all non-aggregated fields are group keys. / legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word ; / Fails because corpus is not aggregated nor is it a group key. / Expressions computed in the SELECT clause cannot be used in the corresponding GROUP BY clause. legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) word count FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word , corpus , word count ; / Fails because word count is not visible to this GROUP BY clause. / Grouping by float and double values is not supported, because the equality function for those types is not well-defined.
- Example This query generates per-year counts of male and female births from the sample natality dataset. legacySQL SELECT year , is male , COUNT ( 1 ) as count FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE year > = 2000 AND year < = 2002 GROUP BY ROLLUP ( year , is male ) ORDER BY year , is male ; These are the results of the query.
- Here we present the full grammar of SELECT statements in a compact form with links back to the individual sections. query : SELECT { field path . expression } [ [ AS ] alias ] [ , ... ] [ FROM from body [ WHERE bool expression ] [ OMIT RECORD IF bool expression ] [ GROUP [ EACH ] BY [ ROLLUP ] { field name or alias } [ , ... ] ] [ HAVING bool expression ] [ ORDER BY field name or alias [ { DESC ASC } ] [, ... ] ] [ LIMIT n ] ]; from body : { from item [, ...] # Warning : Comma means UNION ALL here from item [ join type ] JOIN [ EACH ] from item [ ON join predicate ] ( FLATTEN ( { table name ( query ) } , field name or alias )) table wildcard function } from item : { table name ( query ) } [ [ AS ] alias ] join type : { INNER [ FULL ] [ OUTER ] RIGHT [ OUTER ] LEFT [ OUTER ] CROSS } join predicate : field from one side of the join = field from the other side of the join [ AND ...] expression : { literal value field name or alias function call } bool expression : { expression which results in a boolean value bool expression AND bool expression bool expression OR bool expression NOT bool expression } Notation: Square brackets "[ ]" indicate optional clauses.
- These rows are the rollup rows. +------+---------+----------+ year is male count +------+---------+----------+ NULL NULL 12122730 2000 NULL 4063823 2000 false 1984255 2000 true 2079568 2001 NULL 4031531 2001 false 1970770 2001 true 2060761 2002 NULL 4027376 2002 false 1966519 2002 true 2060857 +------+---------+----------+ When using the ROLLUP function, you can use the GROUPING function to distinguish between rows that were added because of the ROLLUP function and rows that actually have a NULL value for the group key.
