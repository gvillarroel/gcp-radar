# BigQuery non-incremental materialized views over Spanner data

Product: BigQuery
Coverage: HIGH

## Step 02 Summary

BigQuery now supports creating non-incremental materialized views over Spanner data to periodically cache results and improve query performance.

## Extended Definition

BigQuery supports creating non-incremental materialized views over Spanner data, which are intended to improve query performance by periodically caching results. In BigQuery DDL, these views are created with `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`, and the `allow non incremental definition` option (default `false`) enables a broader set of SQL query definitions for materialized view creation.

## Evidence Summary

The release notes explicitly announce non-incremental materialized views over Spanner data for periodic result caching, while the DDL reference documents the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` syntax and the `allow non incremental definition` option that controls support for expanded materialized view query definitions.

Evidence snippets:
- CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS myproject . mydataset . new mv OPTIONS ( expiration timestamp = TIMESTAMP ADD ( CURRENT TIMESTAMP (), INTERVAL 48 HOUR ), friendly name = "new mv" , description = "a view that expires in 2 days" , labels =[ ( "org unit" , "development" ) ] , enable refresh = false ) AS SELECT column 1 , column 2 , column 3 FROM myproject.mydataset.mytable The materialized view is defined using the following GoogleSQL query: SELECT column 1, column 2, column 3 FROM myproject.mydataset.mytable The materialized view option list specifies the: Expiration time: 48 hours from the time the view is created Friendly name: new mv Description: A view that expires in 2 days Label: org unit = development Refresh enabled: false Creating a materialized view with partitioning and clustering The following example creates a materialized view named new mv in mydataset , partitioned by the col datetime column and clustered by the col int column: CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myproject . mydataset . new mv PARTITION BY DATE ( col datetime ) CLUSTER BY col int AS SELECT col int , col datetime , COUNT ( 1 ) as cnt FROM myproject . mydataset . mv base table GROUP BY col int , col datetime The base table, mv base table , must also be partitioned by the col datetime column.
- Examples Creating a new materialized view The following example creates a materialized view named new mv in mydataset : CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myproject . mydataset . new mv OPTIONS ( expiration timestamp = TIMESTAMP ADD ( CURRENT TIMESTAMP (), INTERVAL 48 HOUR ), friendly name = "new mv" , description = "a materialized view that expires in 2 days" , labels =[ ( "org unit" , "development" ) ] , enable refresh = true , refresh interval minutes = 20 ) AS SELECT column 1 , SUM ( column 2 ) AS sum 2 , AVG ( column 3 ) AS avg 3 FROM myproject.mydataset.mytable GROUP BY column 1 If the materialized view name exists in the dataset, the following error is returned: Already Exists: project id:dataset.materialized view When you use a DDL statement to create a materialized view, you must specify the project, dataset, and materialized view in the following format: project id.dataset.materialized view (including the backticks if project id contains special characters); for example, myproject.mydataset.new mv .
- NAME and VALUE must be one of the following combinations: NAME VALUE Details enable refresh BOOLEAN Example: enable refresh=false Default: true refresh interval minutes FLOAT64 Example: refresh interval minutes=20 Default: refresh interval minutes=30 expiration timestamp TIMESTAMP Example: expiration timestamp=TIMESTAMP "2025-01-01 00:00:00 UTC" This property is equivalent to the expirationTime table resource property. expiration timestamp is optional and not used by default. max staleness INTERVAL Example: max staleness=INTERVAL "4:0:0" HOUR TO SECOND The max staleness property provides consistently high performance with controlled costs when processing large, frequently changing datasets. max staleness is disabled by default. allow non incremental definition BOOLEAN Example: allow non incremental definition=true The allow non incremental definition property supports an expanded range of SQL queries to create materialized views. allow non incremental definition=true is disabled by default.
