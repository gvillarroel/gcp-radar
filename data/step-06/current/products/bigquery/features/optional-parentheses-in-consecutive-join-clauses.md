- Notation Example Description Square brackets [ ] Optional clauses Parentheses ( ) Literal parentheses Vertical bar Logical XOR (exclusive OR ) Curly braces { } A set of options, such as { a b c } .
- Provided there are no comma cross joins in the FROM clause, joins don't require parenthesis, though parenthesis can help readability: FROM A JOIN B JOIN C JOIN D USING ( w ) ON B . x = C . y ON A . z = B . x If your clause contains comma cross joins, you must use parentheses: FROM A , B JOIN C JOIN D ON C . x = D . y ON B . z = C . x // INVALID FROM A , B JOIN ( C JOIN D ON C . x = D . y ) ON B . z = C . x // VALID When comma cross joins are present in a query with a sequence of JOINs, they group from left to right like other JOIN types: FROM A JOIN B USING ( x ) JOIN C USING ( x ), D -- A JOIN B USING (x) = result 1 -- result 1 JOIN C USING (x) = result 2 -- result 2 CROSS JOIN D = return value There can't be a RIGHT JOIN or FULL JOIN after a comma cross join unless it's parenthesized: FROM A , B RIGHT JOIN C ON TRUE // INVALID FROM A , B FULL JOIN C ON TRUE // INVALID FROM A , B JOIN C ON TRUE // VALID FROM A , ( B RIGHT JOIN C ON TRUE ) // VALID FROM A , ( B FULL JOIN C ON TRUE ) // VALID Correlated join operation A join operation is correlated when the right from item contains a reference to at least one range variable or column name introduced by the left from item .
- The following examples illustrate the use of parentheses with set operations: -- Same set operations, no parentheses. query1 UNION ALL query2 UNION ALL query3 ; -- Different set operations, parentheses needed. query1 UNION ALL ( query2 UNION DISTINCT query3 ); -- Invalid query1 UNION ALL query2 UNION DISTINCT query3 ; -- Same set operations, no parentheses. query1 EXCEPT DISTINCT query2 EXCEPT DISTINCT query3 ; -- Equivalent query with optional parentheses, returns same results. ( query1 EXCEPT DISTINCT query2 ) EXCEPT DISTINCT query3 ; -- Different execution order with a subquery, parentheses needed. query1 EXCEPT DISTINCT ( query2 EXCEPT DISTINCT query3 ); Set operator behavior with duplicate rows Consider a given row R that appears exactly m times in the first input query and n times in the second input query, where m >= 0 and n >= 0 : For UNION ALL , row R appears exactly m + n times in the result.

Evidence snippets:
- Multiple conditions can be joined by boolean AND and OR clauses, optionally surrounded by parentheses—()— to group them.
- Here we present the full grammar of SELECT statements in a compact form with links back to the individual sections. query : SELECT { field path . expression } [ [ AS ] alias ] [ , ... ] [ FROM from body [ WHERE bool expression ] [ OMIT RECORD IF bool expression ] [ GROUP [ EACH ] BY [ ROLLUP ] { field name or alias } [ , ... ] ] [ HAVING bool expression ] [ ORDER BY field name or alias [ { DESC ASC } ] [, ... ] ] [ LIMIT n ] ]; from body : { from item [, ...] # Warning : Comma means UNION ALL here from item [ join type ] JOIN [ EACH ] from item [ ON join predicate ] ( FLATTEN ( { table name ( query ) } , field name or alias )) table wildcard function } from item : { table name ( query ) } [ [ AS ] alias ] join type : { INNER [ FULL ] [ OUTER ] RIGHT [ OUTER ] LEFT [ OUTER ] CROSS } join predicate : field from one side of the join = field from the other side of the join [ AND ...] expression : { literal value field name or alias function call } bool expression : { expression which results in a boolean value bool expression AND bool expression bool expression OR bool expression NOT bool expression } Notation: Square brackets "[ ]" indicate optional clauses.
- Examples The following query uses a semi-join to find ngrams where the first word in the ngram is also the second word in another ngram that has "AND" as the third word in the ngram. legacySQL SELECT ngram FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . trigrams ] WHERE first IN ( SELECT second FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . trigrams ] WHERE third = "AND" ) LIMIT 10 ; The following query uses a semi-join to return the number of women over age 50 who gave birth in the 10 states with the most births. legacySQL SELECT mother age , COUNT ( mother age ) total FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE state IN ( SELECT state FROM ( SELECT state , COUNT ( state ) total FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] GROUP BY state ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 10 )) AND mother age > 50 GROUP BY mother age ORDER BY mother age DESC To see the numbers for the other 40 states, you can use an anti-join.
- The following query is nearly identical to the previous example, but uses NOT IN instead of IN to return the number of women over age 50 who gave birth in the 40 states with the least births. legacySQL SELECT mother age , COUNT ( mother age ) total FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE state NOT IN ( SELECT state FROM ( SELECT state , COUNT ( state ) total FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] GROUP BY state ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 10 )) AND mother age > 50 GROUP BY mother age ORDER BY mother age DESC Notes: BigQuery does not support correlated semi- or anti-semi-joins.

Evidence snippets:
- You can customize metadata in the new table by using the optional clauses in the SQL statement.
- For more information, see Set up authentication for client libraries . // Import the Google Cloud client library and create a client const { BigQuery } = require ( ' @google-cloud/bigquery ' ); const bigquery = new BigQuery (); async function ddlCreateView () { // Creates a view via a DDL query / TODO(developer): Uncomment the following lines before running the sample. / // const projectId = "my project" // const datasetId = "my dataset" // const tableId = "my new view" const query = CREATE VIEW \ ${ projectId } . ${ datasetId } . ${ tableId } \ OPTIONS( expiration timestamp=TIMESTAMP ADD( CURRENT TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 48 HOUR), friendly name="new view", description="a view that expires in 2 days", labels=[("org unit", "development")] ) AS SELECT name, state, year, number FROM \bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current\ WHERE state LIKE 'W%' ; // For all options, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/query const options = { query : query , }; // Run the query as a job const [ job ] = await bigquery . createQueryJob ( options ); job . on ( 'complete' , metadata = > { console . log ( Created new view ${ tableId } via job ${ metadata . id } ); }); } Python Call the Client.query() method to start a query job.
- The table schema contains 2 columns: transaction id: An integer transaction date: A date The table option list specifies the: Partition expiration: Three days Description: A table partitioned by transaction date Creating a partitioned table from the result of a query The following example creates a partitioned table named days with rain in mydataset using a DATE column: CREATE TABLE mydataset . days with rain PARTITION BY date OPTIONS ( partition expiration days = 365 , description = "weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day" ) AS SELECT DATE ( CAST ( year AS INT64 ), CAST ( mo AS INT64 ), CAST ( da AS INT64 )) AS date , ( SELECT ANY VALUE ( name ) FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.stations AS stations WHERE stations . usaf = stn ) AS station name , -- Stations can have multiple names prcp FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa gsod.gsod2017 AS weather WHERE prcp != 99.9 -- Filter unknown values AND prcp > 0 -- Filter stations/days with no precipitation If you haven't configured a default project, prepend a project ID to the dataset name in the example SQL, and enclose the name in backticks if project id contains special characters: project id.dataset.table .
- Examples The following table function takes an INT64 parameter that is used to filter the results of a query: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example specifies the return TABLE type in the RETURNS clause: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) RETURNS TABLE<name STRING , year INT64 , total INT64 > AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example computes total sales for items with the name item name from the orders table: CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . compute sales ( orders TABLE<item STRING , sales INT64 > , item name STRING ) AS ( SELECT SUM ( sales ) AS total sales , item FROM orders WHERE item = item name GROUP BY item ); CREATE PROCEDURE statement Creates a new procedure , which is a block of statements that can be called from other queries.
