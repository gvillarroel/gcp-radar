# Query queues

Product: BigQuery
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Query queues automatically determine query concurrency based on available slots and queue additional queries when concurrency limits are reached; Query queues let BigQuery manage concurrency dynamically and queue excess queries until resources are available.

Evidence snippets:
- For more information, see Idle slots . --max staleness= INTERVAL Specifies an INTERVAL value that determines the maximum staleness allowed when querying a materialized view or an external table.
- For more information, see Use query queues . --ignore idle slots={true false} To restrict jobs running in this reservation to only use slots allocated to the reservation, set to true .
- The default value is 0, which means that the concurrency is automatically computed based on the reservation size.
- The default value is 0, which means that the concurrency is automatically set based on the reservation size.

- If this reservation was created with an edition , this is equivalent to the amount of baseline slots . target job concurrency INTEGER A soft upper bound on the number of jobs that can run concurrently in this reservation. autoscale max slots INTEGER The maximum number of slots that can be added to the reservation by autoscaling. secondary location STRING The secondary location to use in the case of disaster recovery. is primary BOOLEAN If the value is true , the reservation is set to be the primary reservation. labels <ARRAY<STRUCT<STRING, STRING>>> An array of labels for the reservation, expressed as key-value pairs.
