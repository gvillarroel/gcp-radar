- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/user-defined-functions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/user-defined-functions)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 191
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- For information on UDFs in legacy SQL, see User-defined functions in legacy SQL .
- The following example shows a SQL UDF that uses a scalar subquery to count the number of users with a given age in a user table: CREATE TEMP TABLE users AS ( SELECT 1 AS id , 10 AS age UNION ALL SELECT 2 AS id , 30 AS age UNION ALL SELECT 3 AS id , 10 AS age ); CREATE TEMP FUNCTION countUserByAge ( userAge INT64 ) AS ( ( SELECT COUNT ( 1 ) FROM users WHERE age = userAge ) ); SELECT countUserByAge ( 10 ) AS count user age 10 , countUserByAge ( 20 ) AS count user age 20 , countUserByAge ( 30 ) AS count user age 30 ; This example produces the following output: +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+ count user age 10 count user age 20 count user age 30 +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+ 2 0 1 +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+ Default project in SQL expressions In the body of a SQL UDF, any references to BigQuery entities, such as tables or views, must include the project ID, unless the entity resides in the same project that contains the UDF.
- This rule must enable the following operations: bigquery.routines.get (for using routines) bigquery.tables.getData (for querying BigQuery tables) The following code shows an example YAML config: - egressFrom : identityType : ANY IDENTITY egressTo : operations : - serviceName : 'bigquery.googleapis.com' methodSelectors : - permission : 'bigquery.routines.get' - permission : 'bigquery.tables.getData' resources : - projects/1057666841514 # bigquery-public-data If you want to contribute to the UDFs in this repository, see Contributing UDFs for instructions.
- For example: SELECT id , my utils . my function ( value ) FROM sales ; Limitations The following limitations apply to temporary and persistent user-defined functions: The DOM objects Window , Document , and Node , and functions that require them, are not supported.

### "Data definition language (DDL) statements in GoogleSQL \_|\_ BigQuery \_\

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 138
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- You can use DDL commands to create, alter, and delete resources, such as the following: Datasets Tables Table schemas Table clones Table snapshots Views Connections User-defined functions (UDFs) Indexes Capacity commitments and reservations Row-level access policies Default configuration settings Required permissions To create a job that runs a DDL statement, you must have the bigquery.jobs.create permission for the project where you are running the job.
- IAM roles The predefined IAM roles bigquery.user , bigquery.jobUser , and bigquery.admin include the required bigquery.jobs.create permission.
- BigQuery supports UDFs written in SQL, JavaScript, or Python.
- The constant expression cannot contain: A reference to a table Subqueries or SQL statements such as SELECT , CREATE , or UPDATE User-defined functions, aggregate functions, or analytic functions The following scalar functions: ARRAY TO STRING REPLACE REGEXP REPLACE RAND FORMAT LPAD RPAD REPEAT SESSION USER GENERATE ARRAY GENERATE DATE ARRAY If VALUE evaluates to NULL , the corresponding option NAME in the CREATE VIEW statement is ignored. privacy policy The following policies are available in the privacy policy view option to create analysis rules .

- Final score: 110
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- User-defined functions (UDFs).
- WITH Grid AS ( SELECT 1 x , 2 y ) SELECT Coordinate FROM Grid AS Coordinate ; / --------------+ Coordinate +--------------+ {x: 1, y: 2} +-------------- / Value tables In addition to standard SQL tables , GoogleSQL supports value tables .
- It's also okay for recursive entries to depend on non-recursive entries and vice-versa: WITH RECURSIVE T0 AS ( SELECT 1 AS n ), T1 AS (( SELECT FROM T0 ) UNION ALL ( SELECT n + 1 FROM T1 WHERE n < 4 )), T2 AS (( SELECT 1 AS n ) UNION ALL ( SELECT n + 1 FROM T2 WHERE n < 4 )), T3 AS ( SELECT FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 USING ( n )) SELECT FROM T3 ORDER BY n / ---+ n +---+ 1 2 3 4 +--- / Aggregate functions can be invoked in subqueries, as long as they aren't aggregating on the table being defined: WITH RECURSIVE T0 AS ( SELECT FROM UNNEST ( [ 60 , 20 , 30 ] )), T1 AS (( SELECT 1 AS n ) UNION ALL ( SELECT n + ( SELECT COUNT ( ) FROM T0 ) FROM T1 WHERE n < 4 )) SELECT FROM T1 ORDER BY n / ---+ n +---+ 1 4 +--- / INNER JOIN can be used inside subqueries: WITH RECURSIVE T0 AS ( SELECT 1 AS n ), T1 AS (( SELECT 1 AS n ) UNION ALL ( SELECT n + 1 FROM T1 INNER JOIN T0 USING ( n ))) SELECT FROM T1 ORDER BY n / ---+ n +---+ 1 2 +--- / CROSS JOIN can be used inside subqueries: WITH RECURSIVE T0 AS ( SELECT 2 AS p ), T1 AS (( SELECT 1 AS n ) UNION ALL ( SELECT T1 . n + T0 . p FROM T1 CROSS JOIN T0 WHERE T1 . n < 4 )) SELECT FROM T1 CROSS JOIN T0 ORDER BY n / ---+---+ n p +---+---+ 1 2 3 2 5 2 +---+--- / Recursive CTEs can be used inside CREATE TABLE AS SELECT statements.
- MEASURES clause functions In addition to the standard aggregate functions, you can use the following functions in the MEASURES clause: FIRST(x) : Returns the value of x in the first row of the match, or NULL if the match is empty.
