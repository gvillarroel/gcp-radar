Evidence snippets:
- Cache-enabled tables with materialized views You can use materialized views over BigLake metadata cache-enabled tables to improve performance and efficiency when querying structured data stored in Cloud Storage or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
- To find information about metadata refresh jobs, query the INFORMATION SCHEMA.JOBS view , as shown in the following example: SELECT FROM region-us.INFORMATION SCHEMA.JOBS BY PROJECT WHERE job id LIKE '%metadata cache refresh%' AND creation time > TIMESTAMP SUB ( CURRENT TIMESTAMP (), INTERVAL 6 HOUR ) ORDER BY start time DESC LIMIT 10 ; For Cloud Storage BigLake tables that are based on Parquet files, table statistics are collected during the metadata cache refresh and used to improve query plans.
- These materialized views function like materialized views over BigQuery-managed storage tables, including the benefits of automatic refresh and smart tuning .
- If you create, update, or delete files in Amazon S3, then querying the files does not return the updated data until the next refresh of the metadata cache.
