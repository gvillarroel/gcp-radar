# dbt-bigquery adapter support for BigQuery DataFrames code execution

Product: BigQuery
Coverage: HIGH

## Step 02 Summary

The dbt-bigquery adapter can now execute Python code defined in BigQuery DataFrames.

## Extended Definition

The dbt-bigquery adapter supports executing Python code that is defined using BigQuery DataFrames. The BigQuery release notes indicate this capability was added, allowing dbt users to run DataFrames-defined Python logic through the dbt-bigquery adapter as of the May 29, 2025 update.

## Evidence Summary

The BigQuery release notes page provides a direct feature statement that dbt-bigquery can now run Python code defined in BigQuery DataFrames, with the May 29, 2025 date.
