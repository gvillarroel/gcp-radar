Evidence snippets:
- Example This query adds the GROUPING function to the previous example to better identify the rows added because of the ROLLUP function. legacySQL SELECT year , GROUPING ( year ) as rollup year , is male , GROUPING ( is male ) as rollup gender , COUNT ( 1 ) as count FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE year > = 2000 AND year < = 2002 GROUP BY ROLLUP ( year , is male ) ORDER BY year , is male ; These are the result the new query returns. +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ year rollup year is male rollup gender count +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ NULL 1 NULL 1 12122730 2000 0 NULL 1 4063823 2000 0 false 0 1984255 2000 0 true 0 2079568 2001 0 NULL 1 4031531 2001 0 false 0 1970770 2001 0 true 0 2060761 2002 0 NULL 1 4027376 2002 0 false 0 1966519 2002 0 true 0 2060857 +------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+ Notes: Non-aggregated fields in the SELECT clause must be listed in the GROUP BY clause. legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word , corpus ; / Succeeds because all non-aggregated fields are group keys. / legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word ; / Fails because corpus is not aggregated nor is it a group key. / Expressions computed in the SELECT clause cannot be used in the corresponding GROUP BY clause. legacySQL SELECT word , corpus , COUNT ( word ) word count FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . shakespeare ] WHERE word CONTAINS "th" GROUP BY word , corpus , word count ; / Fails because word count is not visible to this GROUP BY clause. / Grouping by float and double values is not supported, because the equality function for those types is not well-defined.
- If the state does not appear as an option in one of the WHEN statements, the state value will default to "None." Example: legacySQL SELECT CASE WHEN state IN ( 'WA' , 'OR' , 'CA' , 'AK' , 'HI' , 'ID' , 'MT' , 'WY' , 'NV' , 'UT' , 'CO' , 'AZ' , 'NM' ) THEN 'West' WHEN state IN ( 'OK' , 'TX' , 'AR' , 'LA' , 'TN' , 'MS' , 'AL' , 'KY' , 'GA' , 'FL' , 'SC' , 'NC' , 'VA' , 'WV' , 'MD' , 'DC' , 'DE' ) THEN 'South' WHEN state IN ( 'ND' , 'SD' , 'NE' , 'KS' , 'MN' , 'IA' , 'MO' , 'WI' , 'IL' , 'IN' , 'MI' , 'OH' ) THEN 'Midwest' WHEN state IN ( 'NY' , 'PA' , 'NJ' , 'CT' , 'RI' , 'MA' , 'VT' , 'NH' , 'ME' ) THEN 'Northeast' ELSE 'None' END as region , average mother age , average father age , state , year FROM ( SELECT year , state , SUM ( mother age ) / COUNT ( mother age ) as average mother age , SUM ( father age ) / COUNT ( father age ) as average father age FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE father age < 99 GROUP BY year , state ) ORDER BY year LIMIT 5 ; Returns: +--------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+------+ region average mother age average father age state year +--------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+------+ South 24.342600163532296 27.683769419460344 AR 1969 West 25.185041908446163 28.268214055448098 AK 1969 West 24.780776677578217 27.831181063905248 CA 1969 West 25.005834769924412 27.942978384829598 AZ 1969 South 24.541730952905738 27.686430093306885 AL 1969 +--------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+------+ Simulating a Pivot Table Use conditional statements to organize the results of a subselect query into rows and columns.
- Examples The following query uses a semi-join to find ngrams where the first word in the ngram is also the second word in another ngram that has "AND" as the third word in the ngram. legacySQL SELECT ngram FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . trigrams ] WHERE first IN ( SELECT second FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . trigrams ] WHERE third = "AND" ) LIMIT 10 ; The following query uses a semi-join to return the number of women over age 50 who gave birth in the 10 states with the most births. legacySQL SELECT mother age , COUNT ( mother age ) total FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] WHERE state IN ( SELECT state FROM ( SELECT state , COUNT ( state ) total FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . natality ] GROUP BY state ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 10 )) AND mother age > 50 GROUP BY mother age ORDER BY mother age DESC To see the numbers for the other 40 states, you can use an anti-join.
- Uses the 'LEFT()' string function to return only the first 7 characters of the formatted timestamp. / LEFT ( FORMAT UTC USEC ( UTC USEC TO MONTH ( timestamp 1000000 )), 7 ) AS month , SUM ( LENGTH ( comment )) as total chars used FROM [ bigquery - public - data : samples . wikipedia ] WHERE ( contributor username != '' AND contributor username IS NOT NULL ) AND timestamp > 1133395200 AND timestamp < 1157068800 GROUP BY contributor username , month ORDER BY total chars used DESC ; Returns (truncated): +--------------------------------+---------+-----------------------+ contributor username month total chars used +--------------------------------+---------+-----------------------+ Kingbotk 2006-08 18015066 SmackBot 2006-03 7838365 SmackBot 2006-05 5148863 Tawkerbot2 2006-05 4434348 Cydebot 2006-06 3380577 etc ...

Evidence snippets:
- Example: SELECT ARRAY ( SELECT AS STRUCT 1 a , 2 b ) SELECT AS STRUCT can be used in a scalar or array subquery to produce a single STRUCT type grouping multiple values together.
- For example: -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS and CUBE WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , CUBE ( product type , product name )) ORDER BY product type , product name ; / --------------+--------------+-------------+ product type product name product sum +--------------+--------------+-------------+ NULL NULL 42 NULL jeans 6 NULL polo 25 NULL t-shirt 11 pants NULL 6 pants NULL 6 pants jeans 6 shirt NULL 36 shirt NULL 36 shirt polo 25 shirt t-shirt 11 +--------------+--------------+------------- / -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS, but without CUBE -- (produces the same results as GROUPING SETS with CUBE) WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , ( product type , product name ), product type , product name , ()) ORDER BY product type , product name ; Group rows by ROLLUP GROUP BY ROLLUP ( grouping list ) grouping list : { groupable item groupable item set }[, ...] groupable item set : ( groupable item [, ...] ) Description The GROUP BY ROLLUP clause produces aggregated data for rolled up grouping sets .
- In the example below, (product type, product name) is a groupable item set. -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS and a groupable item set WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , ( product type , product name )) ORDER BY product type , product name ; / --------------+--------------+-------------+ product type product name product sum +--------------+--------------+-------------+ pants NULL 6 pants jeans 6 shirt NULL 36 shirt polo 25 shirt t-shirt 11 +--------------+--------------+------------- / -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS but without a groupable item set -- (produces the same results as GROUPING SETS with a groupable item set) WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , NULL , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY product type UNION ALL SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY product type , product name ORDER BY product type , product name ; You can include ROLLUP in a GROUP BY GROUPING SETS clause.
- Examples The following queries produce the same results, but the first one uses GROUP BY GROUPING SETS and the second one doesn't: -- GROUP BY with GROUPING SETS WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY GROUPING SET S ( product type , product name ) ORDER BY product name / --------------+--------------+-------------+ product type product name product sum +--------------+--------------+-------------+ shirt NULL 36 pants NULL 6 NULL jeans 6 NULL polo 25 NULL t-shirt 11 +--------------+--------------+------------- / -- GROUP BY without GROUPING SETS -- (produces the same results as GROUPING SETS) WITH Products AS ( SELECT 'shirt' AS product type , 't-shirt' AS product name , 3 AS product count UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 't-shirt' , 8 UNION ALL SELECT 'shirt' , 'polo' , 25 UNION ALL SELECT 'pants' , 'jeans' , 6 ) SELECT product type , NULL , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY product type UNION ALL SELECT NULL , product name , SUM ( product count ) AS product sum FROM Products GROUP BY product name ORDER BY product name You can include groupable item sets in a GROUP BY GROUPING SETS clause.
