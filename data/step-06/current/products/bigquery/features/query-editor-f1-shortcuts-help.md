- Provided there are no comma cross joins in the FROM clause, joins don't require parenthesis, though parenthesis can help readability: FROM A JOIN B JOIN C JOIN D USING ( w ) ON B . x = C . y ON A . z = B . x If your clause contains comma cross joins, you must use parentheses: FROM A , B JOIN C JOIN D ON C . x = D . y ON B . z = C . x // INVALID FROM A , B JOIN ( C JOIN D ON C . x = D . y ) ON B . z = C . x // VALID When comma cross joins are present in a query with a sequence of JOINs, they group from left to right like other JOIN types: FROM A JOIN B USING ( x ) JOIN C USING ( x ), D -- A JOIN B USING (x) = result 1 -- result 1 JOIN C USING (x) = result 2 -- result 2 CROSS JOIN D = return value There can't be a RIGHT JOIN or FULL JOIN after a comma cross join unless it's parenthesized: FROM A , B RIGHT JOIN C ON TRUE // INVALID FROM A , B FULL JOIN C ON TRUE // INVALID FROM A , B JOIN C ON TRUE // VALID FROM A , ( B RIGHT JOIN C ON TRUE ) // VALID FROM A , ( B FULL JOIN C ON TRUE ) // VALID Correlated join operation A join operation is correlated when the right from item contains a reference to at least one range variable or column name introduced by the left from item .
- Additionally, if implicit clamping is used for an aggregate differentially private function, then half of the function's epsilon is applied towards computing implicit bounds, and half of the function's epsilon is applied towards the differentially private aggregation itself. delta The delta differential privacy parameter represents the probability that any row fails to be epsilon -differentially private in the result of a differentially private query. max groups contributed The max groups contributed differential privacy parameter is a positive integer that, if specified, scales the noise and limits the number of groups that each entity can contribute to. max groups contributed is set by default, even if you don't specify it.
- For this reason, it can be helpful (though it isn't required) to use parentheses to show the scope of the ORDER BY .

Evidence snippets:
- A materialized view can only be partitioned in the same way as the table in query expression (the base table ) is partitioned. clustering column list : A comma-separated list of column references that determine how to cluster the materialized view. materialized view option list : Allows you to specify additional materialized view options such as a whether refresh is enabled, the refresh interval, a label , and an expiration time. query expression : The GoogleSQL query expression used to define the materialized view.
- DDL functionality extends the information returned by a Jobs resource . statistics.query.statementType includes the following additional values: CREATE TABLE CREATE TABLE AS SELECT DROP TABLE CREATE VIEW DROP VIEW statistics.query has 2 additional fields: ddlOperationPerformed : The DDL operation performed, possibly dependent on the existence of the DDL target.
- See Table path syntax . view column name list : Lets you explicitly specify the column names of the view, which may be aliases to the column names in the underlying SQL query. view option list : Additional view creation options such as a label and an expiration time. query expression : The GoogleSQL query expression used to define the view.
- Required permissions To get the permissions that you need to alter vector indexes, ask your administrator to grant you the BigQuery Data Editor ( roles/bigquery.dataEditor ) or BigQuery Data Owner ( roles/bigquery.dataOwner ) IAM role on your table.
