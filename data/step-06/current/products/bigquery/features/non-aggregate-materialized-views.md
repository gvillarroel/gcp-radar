- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 140
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- You can use DDL commands to create, alter, and delete resources, such as the following: Datasets Tables Table schemas Table clones Table snapshots Views Connections User-defined functions (UDFs) Indexes Capacity commitments and reservations Row-level access policies Default configuration settings Required permissions To create a job that runs a DDL statement, you must have the bigquery.jobs.create permission for the project where you are running the job.
- CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS myproject . mydataset . new mv OPTIONS ( expiration timestamp = TIMESTAMP ADD ( CURRENT TIMESTAMP (), INTERVAL 48 HOUR ), friendly name = "new mv" , description = "a view that expires in 2 days" , labels =[ ( "org unit" , "development" ) ] , enable refresh = false ) AS SELECT column 1 , column 2 , column 3 FROM myproject.mydataset.mytable The materialized view is defined using the following GoogleSQL query: SELECT column 1, column 2, column 3 FROM myproject.mydataset.mytable The materialized view option list specifies the: Expiration time: 48 hours from the time the view is created Friendly name: new mv Description: A view that expires in 2 days Label: org unit = development Refresh enabled: false Creating a materialized view with partitioning and clustering The following example creates a materialized view named new mv in mydataset , partitioned by the col datetime column and clustered by the col int column: CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myproject . mydataset . new mv PARTITION BY DATE ( col datetime ) CLUSTER BY col int AS SELECT col int , col datetime , COUNT ( 1 ) as cnt FROM myproject . mydataset . mv base table GROUP BY col int , col datetime The base table, mv base table , must also be partitioned by the col datetime column.
- Required permissions This statement requires the following IAM permissions : Permission Resource bigquery.bireservations.update BI Engine reservation Examples Allocating BI Engine capacity without preferred tables ALTER BI CAPACITY my-project.region-us.default SET OPTIONS ( size gb = 250 ) Deallocating BI capacity ALTER BI CAPACITY my-project.region-us.default SET OPTIONS ( size gb = 0 ) Removing a set of preferred tables from reservation ALTER BI CAPACITY my-project.region-us.default SET OPTIONS ( preferred tables = NULL ) Allocating BI Capacity with preferred tables list ALTER BI CAPACITY my-project.region-us.default SET OPTIONS ( size gb = 250 , preferred tables = [ "data project1.dataset1.table1" , "data project2.dataset2.table2" ] ) Overwriting list of preferred tables without changing the size ALTER BI CAPACITY region-us.default SET OPTIONS ( preferred tables = [ "dataset1.table1" , "data project2.dataset2.table2" ] ) ALTER CAPACITY SET OPTIONS statement Alters an existing capacity commitment.
- NAME and VALUE must be one of the following combinations: NAME VALUE Details enable refresh BOOLEAN Example: enable refresh=false Default: true refresh interval minutes FLOAT64 Example: refresh interval minutes=20 Default: refresh interval minutes=30 expiration timestamp TIMESTAMP Example: expiration timestamp=TIMESTAMP "2025-01-01 00:00:00 UTC" This property is equivalent to the expirationTime table resource property. expiration timestamp is optional and not used by default. max staleness INTERVAL Example: max staleness=INTERVAL "4:0:0" HOUR TO SECOND The max staleness property provides consistently high performance with controlled costs when processing large, frequently changing datasets. max staleness is disabled by default. allow non incremental definition BOOLEAN Example: allow non incremental definition=true The allow non incremental definition property supports an expanded range of SQL queries to create materialized views. allow non incremental definition=true is disabled by default.

Evidence snippets:
- If the configuration setting is not specified, the default value is true ; the query uses legacy SQL. --vertex ai model id= VERTEX AI MODEL ID When specified, updates the model ID for a BigQuery ML model that is registered in the Vertex AI Model Registry. --view= QUERY When specified, updates the SQL query for a view. --view udf resource= FILE Updates the Cloud Storage URI or the path to a local code file that is loaded and evaluated immediately as a user-defined function resource in a view's SQL query.
- For more information about using the bq ls command, see the following: Managing jobs Listing datasets in a project Creating and using tables Listing views in a dataset Working with transfers Listing table snapshots in a dataset bq mk Use the bq mk command to create a BigQuery resource.
- This example shows how to run a GoogleSQL query on the command line: bq query --nouse legacy sql \ 'SELECT COUNT( ) FROM bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare' Flags with boolean values can be specified without an argument.
- How to add flags to .bigqueryrc To add default values for command-line flags to .bigqueryrc : Place global flags at the top of the file without a header.

### Authorized views \_|\_ BigQuery \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-5`
- Final score: 112
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For details about how row-level security interacts with materialized views, see Use row-level security with other BigQuery features .
- Authorized views This document describes how to create authorized views and authorized materialized views in BigQuery.
- To compare these methods in detail, see the following resources: Comparison of authorized views, row-level security, and separate tables Introduction to row-level security Example use cases for row-level security Introduction to column-level access control Share all views in a dataset If you want to give a collection of views access to a dataset without having to authorize each individual view, you can group the views together into a dataset, and then give the dataset that contains the views access to the dataset that contains the data.
- Admin permissions on the second dataset that gives access to the view To update dataset properties, you need the following IAM permissions: bigquery.datasets.update bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy (only required when updating dataset access controls in the Google Cloud console) The roles/bigquery.dataOwner predefined IAM role includes the permissions that you need to update dataset properties.
