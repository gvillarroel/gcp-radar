Evidence snippets:
- SELECT FROM EXTERNAL QUERY ( "region.connection id" , "select from information schema.columns where table name='x';" ); Track BigQuery federated queries When you run a federated query against AlloyDB, BigQuery annotates the query with a comment similar to the following: / Federated query from BigQuery.
- AlloyDB federated queries As a data analyst, you can query data in AlloyDB for PostgreSQL from BigQuery using federated queries .
- Go to the Logs Explorer In the Query tab, enter the following query: resource.type="alloydb.googleapis.com/Instance" textPayload= "Federated query from BigQuery" Click Run query .
- The following example makes a federated query to an AlloyDB table named orders and joins the results with a BigQuery table named mydataset.customers .

Evidence snippets:
- BigQuery supports accessing select external data sources through Cloud Storage and federated queries.
- Run queries on shared data To run queries on a BigQuery dataset that someone has shared with you, see Introduction to BigQuery sharing (formerly Analytics Hub) .
- The following list describes some of the alternatives: Run queries on public data Public datasets are datasets stored in BigQuery and shared with the public.
- Run queries with log data You can run queries on logs without creating additional load jobs: Cloud Logging lets you route logs to a BigQuery destination .

Evidence snippets:
- Examples The following table function takes an INT64 parameter that is used to filter the results of a query: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example specifies the return TABLE type in the RETURNS clause: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . names by year ( y INT64 ) RETURNS TABLE<name STRING , year INT64 , total INT64 > AS SELECT year , name , SUM ( number ) AS total FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE year = y GROUP BY year , name The following example computes total sales for items with the name item name from the orders table: CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset . compute sales ( orders TABLE<item STRING , sales INT64 > , item name STRING ) AS ( SELECT SUM ( sales ) AS total sales , item FROM orders WHERE item = item name GROUP BY item ); CREATE PROCEDURE statement Creates a new procedure , which is a block of statements that can be called from other queries.
- For more information, see Set up authentication for client libraries . from google.cloud import bigquery project = 'my-project' dataset id = 'my dataset' table id = 'new view' client = bigquery.Client(project=project) sql = """ CREATE VIEW {} . {} . {} OPTIONS( expiration timestamp=TIMESTAMP ADD( CURRENT TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 48 HOUR), friendly name="new view", description="a view that expires in 2 days", labels=[("org unit", "development")] ) AS SELECT name, state, year, number FROM bigquery-public-data.usa names.usa 1910 current WHERE state LIKE 'W%' """ . format ( project , dataset id , table id ) job = client . query ( sql ) # API request. job . result () # Waits for the query to finish. print ( 'Created new view " {} . {} . {} ".' . format ( job . destination . project , job . destination . dataset id , job . destination . table id , ) ) On-demand query size calculation If you use on-demand billing, BigQuery charges for data definition language (DDL) queries based on the number of bytes processed by the query.
- Examples Setting the expiration timestamp and description on a table The following example sets the expiration timestamp on a table to seven days from the execution time of the ALTER TABLE statement, and sets the description as well: ALTER TABLE mydataset . mytable SET OPTIONS ( expiration timestamp = TIMESTAMP ADD ( CURRENT TIMESTAMP (), INTERVAL 7 DAY ), description = "Table that expires seven days from now" ) Setting the require partition filter attribute on a partitioned table The following example sets the timePartitioning.requirePartitionFilter attribute on a partitioned table : ALTER TABLE mydataset . mypartitionedtable SET OPTIONS ( require partition filter = true ) Queries that reference this table must use a filter on the partitioning column, or else BigQuery returns an error.
- Example: replication interval seconds=900 Required permissions This statement requires the following IAM permissions : bigquery.tables.create bigquery.tables.get bigquery.tables.getData bigquery.tables.replicateData bigquery.jobs.create Example The following example creates a materialized view replica named mv replica in bq dataset : CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myproject . bq dataset . mv replica OPTIONS ( replication interval seconds = 600 ) AS REPLICA OF myproject.s3 dataset.my s3 mv CREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMA statement Creates a new federated dataset.
