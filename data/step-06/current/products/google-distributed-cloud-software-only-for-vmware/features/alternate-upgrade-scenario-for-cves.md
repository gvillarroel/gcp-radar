# Alternate upgrade scenario for CVEs

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

The alternate upgrade scenario for common vulnerabilities and exposures is deprecated; deprecated on 2020-06-25.

## Extended Definition

The feature name suggests a CVE-focused alternate upgrade workflow, but the provided Google Cloud excerpts do not document that flow itself. The available evidence only shows standard upgrade mechanisms in Google Distributed Cloud for VMware (for example, `gkectl upgrade`/rollback operations, control plane and node pool upgrade events, and dry-run or async upgrade options), so this specific alternate CVE upgrade scenario should be treated as unconfirmed in the supplied sources and likely historical/legacy.

## Evidence Summary

The cited pages document GDC VMware upgrade workflows and version/support policy, but do not provide explicit text describing an "alternate upgrade scenario for CVEs" or its 2020-06-25 deprecation.

- Update the Windows node pools to use the new template by running: gkectl update cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --config USER CLUSTER CONFIG If the new version requires changes from Anthos's side, you must wait for the next monthly Anthos patch release and upgrade the clusters .
