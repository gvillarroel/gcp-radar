# Anthos clusters on VMware 1.9.6-gke.1

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

A maintenance release of Anthos clusters on VMware that runs on Kubernetes 1.21.5-gke.1200.

## Extended Definition

Anthos clusters on VMware supports specific security and operational behaviors documented per release context, including Kubernetes control-plane capability limits such as not supporting the EventRateLimit admission controller because it is a Kubernetes alpha feature. For this platform, cluster maintenance includes patching workflows where Windows node pools can be rolled to a new VM template using `gkectl update cluster`, and urgent Windows patch updates are handled outside normal release cycles when needed. The documentation confirms this as a patched/maintenance-operational model for Anthos on VMware, but it does not explicitly confirm the exact release identifier "1.9.6-gke.1" in the provided excerpts.

## Evidence Summary

The cited pages provide security-control and patch-management evidence for Anthos clusters on VMware, including a noted unsupported alpha admission controller and documented monthly/urgent maintenance update procedures for Windows node pools.

Evidence snippets:
- Update the Windows node pools to use the new template by running: gkectl update cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --config USER CLUSTER CONFIG If the new version requires changes from Anthos's side, you must wait for the next monthly Anthos patch release and upgrade the clusters .
- Security patch process Besides the regular patch releases for the supported Anthos versions, the Anthos team also continuously qualifies newer Windows patch updates during non-release time periods, and publishes the results for your reference.
- If an urgent security patch update is needed between Anthos patch releases, you can build a new VM template using the latest version, and then perform a rolling update for the existing Windows node pools to use the new template.
- Make sure you are using the latest qualified patch version for Windows Server 2019, check our release notes to find out the latest qualified Windows OS image version for a given Anthos release version.
