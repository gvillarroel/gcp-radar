# vSphere DRS rules for user cluster nodes

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: HIGH

## Step 02 Summary

GKE On-Prem creates vSphere DRS rules to spread user cluster nodes across at least three physical hosts.

## Extended Definition

In Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware, vSphere DRS anti-affinity rules can be created for user cluster nodes to spread those nodes across at least three physical hosts in the datacenter. By default this anti-affinity rule creation is automatic for user clusters, and it can be controlled via the optional `--disable-aag-config` flag during cluster creation.

## Evidence Summary

The create-user-cluster guide explicitly documents that user-cluster nodes get automatically distributed via vSphere DRS anti-affinity rules across at least three physical hosts unless the disable flag is provided.

Evidence snippets:
- For example: --dns-search-domains example.com,examplepetstore.com For a complete list of the flags and their descriptions, see the gcloud CLI reference . vSphere flags Specify the following optional flags if needed: --disable-aag-config : If you don't include this flag the VMware Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) anti-affinity rules are automatically created for your user cluster's nodes, causing them to be spread across at least 3 physical hosts in your data center.
- Example of filled-in configuration files Here is an example of an IP block file and a user cluster configuration file; user-ipblock.yaml blocks: - netmask: 255.255.255.0 gateway: 172.16.21.1 ips: - ip: 172.16.21.2 hostname: worker-vm-1 - ip: 172.16.21.3 hostname: worker-vm-2 - ip: 172.16.21.4 hostname: worker-vm-3 - ip: 172.16.21.5 hostname: worker-vm-4 user-cluster.yaml cat user-cluster.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: UserCluster name: "my-user-cluster" gkeOnPremVersion: 1.34.200-gke.68 enableControlplaneV2: true enableDataplaneV2: true network: hostConfig: dnsServers: - "203.0.113.2" - "198.51.100.2" ntpServers: - "216.239.35.4" ipMode: type: "static" ipBlockFilePath: "user-ipblock.yaml" serviceCIDR: 10.96.0.0/20 podCIDR: 192.168.0.0/16 controlPlaneIPBlock: netmask: "255.255.255.0" gateway: "172.16.21.1" ips: - ip: "172.16.21.6" hostname: "cp-vm-1" - ip: "172.16.21.7" hostname: "cp-vm-2" - ip: "172.16.21.8" hostname: "cp-vm-3" loadBalancer: vips: controlPlaneVIP: "172.16.21.40" ingressVIP: "172.16.21.30" kind: MetalLB metalLB: addressPools: - name: "address-pool-1" addresses: - "172.16.21.30-172.16.21.39" masterNode: cpus: 4 memoryMB: 8192 replicas: 3 nodePools: - name: "worker-node-pool" cpus: 4 memoryMB: 8192 replicas: 3 enableLoadBalancer: true antiAffinityGroups: enabled: true gkeConnect: projectID: "my-project-123" location: "us-central1" registerServiceAccountKeyPath: "connect-register-sa-2203040617.json" stackdriver: projectID: "my-project-123" clusterLocation: "us-central1" enableVPC: false serviceAccountKeyPath: "log-mon-sa-2203040617.json" autoRepair: enabled: true These are the important points to understand in the preceding example: The nodePools.replicas field is set to 3 , which means there are three worker nodes in "worker-node-pool" .
- For more information about load balancing options, see Overview of load balancing . advancedNetworking If you plan to create an egress NAT gateway , set advancedNetworking to true . multipleNetworkInterfaces Decide whether you want to configure multiple network interfaces for Pods, and set multipleNetworkInterfaces accordingly. storage If you want to disable the deployment of vSphere CSI components, set storage.vSphereCSIDisabled to true . masterNode In the masterNode section, you can specify how many control-plane nodes you want for your user cluster: specify 3 for a highly-available (HA) cluster or 1 for a non-HA cluster.
