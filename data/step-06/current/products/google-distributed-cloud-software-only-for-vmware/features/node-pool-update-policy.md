# Node pool update policy

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

The node pool update policy controls maximumConcurrentNodePoolUpdate to limit additional nodes during upgrades or updates.

## Extended Definition

In Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware, node pool updates are carried out through `gkectl update cluster` (and `gkectl upgrade cluster`) operations against a user cluster using the admin cluster kubeconfig and cluster configuration, which can be used to apply changes to node pools such as Windows node pool updates or template updates. The provided excerpts only show the update/upgrade execution pattern and job flow, not the concrete policy knobs or a named setting that limits concurrent node-pool updates, so that aspect is not evidenced here.

## Evidence Summary

These official pages confirm that user-cluster node pools can be updated via gkectl commands and that updates are part of upgrade workflows, but they do not provide evidence for a specific `maximumConcurrentNodePoolUpdate` policy setting.

- If you used gkeadm to create your admin workstation, open your admin workstation configuration file so you can copy values from the vCenter section to the corresponding placeholder variables. resource "google gkeonprem vmware admin cluster" "admin-cluster-metallb" { provider = google-beta name = " ADMIN CLUSTER NAME " project = " PROJECT ID " location = " REGION " description = " DESCRIPTION " bootstrap cluster membership = "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /memberships/bootstrap- ADMIN CLUSTER NAME " on prem version = " VERSION " image type = " IMAGE TYPE " vcenter { address = " VCENTER ADDRESS " datacenter = " DATA CENTER " cluster = " VCENTER CLUSTER " resource pool = " RESOURCE POOL " datastore = " DATASTORE " ca cert data = " CA CERT DATA " } network config { service address cidr blocks = [" 10.96.232.0/24 "] pod address cidr blocks = [" 192.168.0.0/16 "] vcenter network = " NETWORK " dhcp ip config { enabled = true } host config { dns servers = [" DNS SERVERS "] ntp servers = [" NTP SERVERS "] } ha control plane config { control plane ip block { gateway = " GATEWAY " netmask = " NETMASK " ips { hostname = " CONTROL PLANE HOST 1 " ip = " CONTROL PLANE NODE IP 1 " } ips { hostname = " CONTROL PLANE HOST 2 " ip = " CONTROL PLANE NODE IP 2 " } ips { hostname = " CONTROL PLANE HOST 3 " ip = " CONTROL PLANE NODE IP 3 " } } } } control plane node { cpus = NUM CPUS memory = MEMORY replicas = 3 } load balancer { vip config { control plane vip = " CONTROL PLANE VIP " } metal lb config { enabled = true } } } Replace the following: ADMIN CLUSTER NAME : the name for the admin cluster.
- Note, however, the command takes additional values that you must specify in the provided placeholder variables. gkectl register bootstrap \ --target-cluster-name= ADMIN CLUSTER NAME \ --project-id= PROJECT ID \ --location= REGION \ --vcenter-address= VCENTER ADDRESS \ --vcenter-datacenter= DATA CENTER \ --vcenter-cluster= VCENTER CLUSTER \ --vcenter-resource-pool= RESOURCE POOL \ --vcenter-datastore= DATASTORE \ --vcenter-network= NETWORK \ --vcenter-ca-cert-path= CA CERT PATH \ --bundle-path= BUNDLE PATH \ --component-access-service-account-key-path= COMPONENT ACCESS SA PATH \ --register-service-account-key-path= CONNECT REGISTER SA PATH \ --stackdriver-service-account-key-path= LOG MON SA PATH \ --cloud-audit-logging-service-account-key-path= CLOUD AUDIT SA PATH \ --admin-kubeconfig-out= KUBECONFIG NAME Replace the following with admin workstation paths: CA CERT PATH : the path to the root CA certificate for your vCenter Server.
- If you want to use a VM storage policy for the cluster nodes, remove the vcenter.datastore field and add vcenter.storage policy name instead.

- Look for LocalScriptPlugin in the log file, and check the related logs. - Build a new Windows VM template. - Update the Windows node pools to use the new template by running: gkectl update cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --config USER CLUSTER CONFIG Considerations for Windows containers Some notable differences between Windows and Linux containers are: Version compatibility of Windows container images and the host/node OS images.
- If you are using DHCP mode, the newly created VMs are likely to have duplicated IPs again since the DHCP server is encountering issues for IP allocation, you can delete the pending Windows node pool by running gkectl update cluster , and add it back in user-cluster.yaml, run gkectl update cluster again for creating it, the newly created node pool should have correct IP allocations.
- Update the Windows node pools to use the new template by running: gkectl update cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --config USER CLUSTER CONFIG If the new version requires changes from Anthos's side, you must wait for the next monthly Anthos patch release and upgrade the clusters .
