# Cluster backup operation logging

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Provides more detailed logs for cluster backup operations, including per-step status.

## Extended Definition

In Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware, cluster backup operation logging is associated with the admin-cluster `clusterBackup` feature, which enables admin-cluster backups by configuring a `clusterBackup.datastore` location for backup storage. The documentation links backup operations to normal cluster lifecycle logging: logs and metadata (including Admin Audit logs and Cloud Logging/Cloud Monitoring data) are written to the configured Cloud region, and command execution output is shown during cluster operations. Evidence for this feature is partial, and the provided excerpts do not explicitly confirm per-step backup-status log granularity.

## Evidence Summary

The cited pages confirm `clusterBackup` configuration for admin clusters and that cluster logs/audit data are stored in Cloud Logging/Cloud Monitoring, but they do not explicitly document detailed per-step backup-operation status logging.
