# Storage DRS manual mode support

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Storage DRS can now be enabled in manual mode.

## Extended Definition

In Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware, the cited Google documentation shows DRS-related control via the admin-cluster setting `antiAffinityGroups.enabled`, which enables or disables VMware DRS anti-affinity rule creation for admin cluster nodes. The setting is prepopulated to `true`, creates spread rules across at least three ESXi hosts when enabled, and should be set to `false` when VMware DRS is not available or prerequisites are not met. The provided excerpts do not document a Storage DRS manual-mode option; the phrase “manual mode” appears only in load balancer migration guidance.

## Evidence Summary

The cited docs provide evidence of `antiAffinityGroups.enabled` (VMware DRS anti-affinity rules) and a separate load-balancer manual-mode reference, but no direct Storage DRS manual-mode setting.
