# Forced deletion of unhealthy user clusters

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Gkectl can forcibly delete broken or unhealthy user clusters.

## Extended Definition

The provided Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware excerpts document gkectl-based operations for user clusters—such as create, update, upgrade, diagnose, and backup/restore in advanced clusters—but do not explicitly describe a command or workflow for forcibly deleting unhealthy user clusters. Because of this, evidence for the specific "forced deletion of unhealthy user clusters" feature is weak and cannot be confirmed directly from the supplied page excerpts.

## Evidence Summary

These pages provide gkectl command coverage for cluster lifecycle and health/backup workflows, but none of the supplied excerpts explicitly document forced deletion behavior for unhealthy user clusters.

Evidence snippets:
- Update the Windows node pools to use the new template by running: gkectl update cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --config USER CLUSTER CONFIG If the new version requires changes from Anthos's side, you must wait for the next monthly Anthos patch release and upgrade the clusters .
- It is recommended that you use a user account with the minimum permissions required for an Active Directory domain join, instead of using an Administrator user. (Optional) To avoid storing the password as cleartext in this script, place the password in a file on the VM template, let the script read from that password file, then delete the file after the domain join. $domain = "[DOMAIN NAME]" $password = "[PASSWORD]" ConvertTo-SecureString -asPlainText -Force $username = "$domain\[USERNAME]" $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($username,$password) Add-Computer -DomainName $domain -Credential $credential -restart –force Create a Windows VM template with a customized script: gkectl prepare windows --base-vm-template BASE WINDOWS VM TEMPLATE NAME --bundle-path BUNDLE PATH --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --customized-script CUSTOMIZED SCRIPT PATH Replace BUNDLE PATH with the path to the bundle.
- Create a new cluster gkectl create cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --config USER CLUSTER CONFIG Update an existing cluster with the new Windows node pool gkectl update cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --config USER CLUSTER CONFIG Upgrade an existing cluster with the new Windows node pool gkectl upgrade cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --config USER CLUSTER CONFIG Step 6: Validate Windows nodes are running Check that your Windows nodes have been created and are Ready . kubectl --kubeconfig USER KUBECONFIG get nodes Diagnose the user cluster to check whether it's healthy. gkectl diagnose cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --cluster-name CLUSTER NAME Deploy a Windows Pod Windows Server nodes are tainted with this key-value pair: node.kubernetes.io/os=windows:NoSchedule .

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Backup to vSphere To configure backups so that the backup file for both admin and user clusters are uploaded to vSphere in addition to being saved on your admin workstation, do the following: Add the clusterBackup.datastore field to your admin cluster configuration file: clusterBackup : datastore : DATASTORE Replace DATASTORE with the datastore where you want to store the backup.
- Optionally, you can specify a different name and location for your backup file with the --backup-file flag, for example: gkectl backup cluster testuser \ --kubeconfig admin-cluster/kubeconfig \ --backup-file cluster-backups/testuser-backup-aug-23-2025.tar.gz The backup file expires after a year and the cluster restore process doesn't work with expired backup files.
- Run the applicable command to back up the cluster: Admin cluster gkectl backup admin --kubeconfig ADMIN KUBECONFIG User cluster gkectl backup cluster --cluster-name CLUSTER NAME \ --kubeconfig ADMIN KUBECONFIG By default, the backup tar file is saved to the directory gkectl-workspace/backups on your admin workstation.
- User cluster gkectl restore cluster --cluster-name CLUSTER NAME \ --kubeconfig ADMIN KUBECONFIG \ --control-plane-node WORKING NODE IP \ --ssh-key USER SSH KEY PATH Replace the following: CLUSTER NAME : the name of the cluster you are restoring.
