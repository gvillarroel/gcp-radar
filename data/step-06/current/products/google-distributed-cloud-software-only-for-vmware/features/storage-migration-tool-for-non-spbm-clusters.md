# storage migration tool for non-SPBM clusters

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

A storage migration tool can move data from one datastore to another in non-SPBM clusters.

## Extended Definition

Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware documents a datastore migration capability for Storage Policy-Based Management (SPBM), shown as "Storage migration with SPBM" and "Migrate a datastore to a SPBM." These entries indicate a built-in feature that moves datastore contents as part of SPBM-related storage operations. The provided excerpts do not explicitly confirm behavior for non-SPBM clusters.

## Evidence Summary

The official feature tables list SPBM storage migration features as GA (including migrate-a-datastore actions) and provide their release availability, which supports existence of datastore migration functionality but not specifically a non-SPBM variant.

- Support tools To troubleshoot business-critical incidents effectively, Cloud Customer Care relies on three pieces of information: Your environment's configuration Logs from your admin and user clusters Metrics from your admin and user clusters Configuration When you open a support case, you are asked to run the gkectl diagnose snapshot --seed-config command and attach the resulting tar file to the support case.
- The following table provides further details: Cloud Customer Care Collaborative Support Not Supported Kubernetes and the container runtime VMware vSphere (vCenter Server and ESXi) VMware products beyond vSphere Canonical Ubuntu for guest/node OS F5 BIG-IP load balancers Customer code (For more information, see the Developer Support section) vCenter controller Hardware and hyper-converged infrastructure solutions as listed in the Collaborative Support Partners page Customer choice of host OS F5 controller Physical server, storage, and network Calico and related network policies External DNS, DHCP, and identity systems Ingress controller Calico Enterprise Edition Prometheus and Grafana Stackdriver Monitoring, Stackdriver Logging, and Stackdriver agents Identity federation with OIDC compliant providers Hub, Connect, and the Connect Agent Knative serving / Knative Bundled LoadBalancer (Seesaw) Supported features This document lists the features for Google Distributed Cloud for supported releases.
- To get the admin or user cluster name, you can use: gkectl list admin --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG gkectl list clusters --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG To grant access to the cluster, you run a gcloud CLI command that generates and displays a set of Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies and applies them to the target cluster.
