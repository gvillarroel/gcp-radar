# Anthos clusters on VMware 1.11.1-gke.53

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

A maintenance release of Anthos clusters on VMware that runs on Kubernetes 1.22.8-gke.200.

## Extended Definition

Anthos clusters on VMware are managed through Anthos patch releases, and cluster updates can be performed with `gkectl update cluster` using a new cluster/node template when versions or patches require changes. Within this platform behavior, the `EventRateLimit` admission controller is not supported because it is a Kubernetes alpha feature, so it is not set in Anthos clusters on VMware. For Windows node pools, qualified security updates can be applied from release notes and, if needed urgently, through rolling updates using a new VM template between regular patch releases.

## Evidence Summary

The CIS benchmark page provides the supported/unsupported feature context for Anthos on VMware, while the Windows node pool guide explains patch cadence and how urgent security patching can be done with VM template updates.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Update the Windows node pools to use the new template by running: gkectl update cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --config USER CLUSTER CONFIG If the new version requires changes from Anthos's side, you must wait for the next monthly Anthos patch release and upgrade the clusters .
- Security patch process Besides the regular patch releases for the supported Anthos versions, the Anthos team also continuously qualifies newer Windows patch updates during non-release time periods, and publishes the results for your reference.
- If an urgent security patch update is needed between Anthos patch releases, you can build a new VM template using the latest version, and then perform a rolling update for the existing Windows node pools to use the new template.
- Make sure you are using the latest qualified patch version for Windows Server 2019, check our release notes to find out the latest qualified Windows OS image version for a given Anthos release version.
