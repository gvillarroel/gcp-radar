# Admin cluster add-on node auto sizing

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Admin cluster add-on nodes automatically resize in proportion to the number of nodes in the admin cluster.

## Extended Definition

Admin cluster add-on node auto sizing in Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware is a configurable behavior for the admin cluster that allows add-on nodes to resize automatically. The admin cluster configuration defines a mutable boolean option (defaulting to false) for add-on node auto resizing, and setting it to true enables that automatic resizing.

## Evidence Summary

The cited admin cluster configuration page provides direct evidence that a boolean setting controls automatic resizing of admin-cluster add-on nodes, but it does not detail the exact resizing algorithm or policy.

- Use this field to specify whether you want Google Distributed Cloud to create VMware Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) anti-affinity rules for your admin cluster nodes, causing them to be spread across at least three physical hosts in your data center. adminMaster If you want to specify CPU and memory for the control-plane nodes of the admin cluster, fill in the cpus and memoryMB fields in the adminMaster section.
- Backing up the admin cluster to a vSphere datastore isn't supported. autoRepair If you want to enable automatic node repair for your admin cluster, set autoRepair.enabled to true . secretsEncryption If you want to enable always-on Secrets encryption , fill in the secretsEncryption section.
- Set the replicas field in the adminMaster section to 3 . proxy If the network that will have your admin cluster nodes is behind a proxy server, fill in the proxy section. privateRegistry Decide where you want to keep container images for the Google Distributed Cloud components.

- For example: --dns-search-domains example.com,examplepetstore.com For a complete list of the flags and their descriptions, see the gcloud CLI reference . vSphere flags Specify the following optional flags if needed: --disable-aag-config : If you don't include this flag the VMware Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) anti-affinity rules are automatically created for your user cluster's nodes, causing them to be spread across at least 3 physical hosts in your data center.
- For example, you may select 1 control-plane node for a development environment and 3 control-planes nodes for high availability (HA), production environments. --enable-auto-resize : If you want to enable automatic resizing of the control-plane nodes for the user cluster, include --enable-auto-resize .
- Enable anti-affinity groups : VMware Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) anti-affinity rules are automatically created for your user cluster's nodes, causing them to be spread across at least 3 physical hosts in your data center.
