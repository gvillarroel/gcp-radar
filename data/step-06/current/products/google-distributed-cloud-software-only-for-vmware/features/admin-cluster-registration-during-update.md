# Admin cluster registration during update

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: HIGH

## Step 02 Summary

You can register an existing admin cluster when updating it.

## Extended Definition

For Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware, this feature is to register an admin cluster to a fleet by including the gkeConnect section in the admin cluster configuration. The documentation states that when gkeConnect is configured, the admin cluster is automatically registered during cluster creation or update, and removing that section on a later update can cause the update to fail.

## Evidence Summary

These official pages consistently state that the gkeConnect config triggers automatic fleet registration for admin clusters during create/update, and that removing gkeConnect after it was added can make a later update fail.
