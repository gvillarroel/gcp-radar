# Anthos clusters on VMware 1.9.4-gke.3

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

A maintenance release of Anthos clusters on VMware that runs on Kubernetes v1.21.5-gke.1200.

## Extended Definition

Anthos clusters on VMware support a maintenance model with monthly Anthos patch releases and additional security patch handling; for Windows node pools, urgent security updates between releases can be applied by building a new VM template and performing a rolling update. The documentation also explicitly notes that Anthos clusters on VMware do not support the EventRateLimit admission controller because it is a Kubernetes alpha feature. The available excerpts do not explicitly confirm the exact release identifier "1.9.4-gke.3" or its Kubernetes base version, so those version-specific claims are not independently evidenced here.

## Evidence Summary

The cited official pages confirm patch-release practices and a key unsupported feature in Anthos on VMware, but do not directly document the specific 1.9.4-gke.3 maintenance release details.

- Final score: 147
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Update the Windows node pools to use the new template by running: gkectl update cluster --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG --config USER CLUSTER CONFIG If the new version requires changes from Anthos's side, you must wait for the next monthly Anthos patch release and upgrade the clusters .
- Security patch process Besides the regular patch releases for the supported Anthos versions, the Anthos team also continuously qualifies newer Windows patch updates during non-release time periods, and publishes the results for your reference.
- If an urgent security patch update is needed between Anthos patch releases, you can build a new VM template using the latest version, and then perform a rolling update for the existing Windows node pools to use the new template.
- Make sure you are using the latest qualified patch version for Windows Server 2019, check our release notes to find out the latest qualified Windows OS image version for a given Anthos release version.
