# Admin cluster Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging controls

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

You can enable or disable Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging for the admin cluster with gkectl update admin.

## Extended Definition

In Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware, admin cluster Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring are managed via the admin cluster configuration using a `stackdriver` section. The docs state that filling in this `stackdriver` section enables Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring for the admin cluster (including required fields such as `projectID` and service-account key data). The excerpts show this section as required for Logging and Monitoring, with guidance to omit it only when GKE On-Prem API integration is disabled, but they do not directly confirm the exact `gkectl update admin` toggle flow in the provided text.

## Evidence Summary

These pages define the `stackdriver` config block as the admin-cluster control point for enabling Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring, but do not explicitly document a CLI update command in the provided excerpts.
