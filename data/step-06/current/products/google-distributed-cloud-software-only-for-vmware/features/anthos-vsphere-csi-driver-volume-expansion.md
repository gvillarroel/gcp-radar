# Anthos vSphere CSI driver volume expansion

Product: Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

The Anthos vSphere CSI driver supports offline and online expansion for dynamically and statically created block volumes.

## Extended Definition

The Anthos vSphere CSI driver is the vSphere-backed storage component in Google Distributed Cloud (software only) for VMware that runs in user clusters to provision persistent volumes on vSphere storage. Documentation shows it is used with Kubernetes StorageClass and PersistentVolumeClaim workflows (including Windows node-pool usage), which enables cluster workloads to consume vSphere-backed persistent storage. The provided excerpts do not explicitly confirm offline versus online volume expansion or block-volume expansion behavior, so that specific capability is not evidenced here.

## Evidence Summary

The cited pages establish that CSI is used to provision persistent volumes on vSphere in Anthos user clusters and is referenced in storage class/persistent storage guidance, but do not directly state CSI volume expansion mechanics.

Evidence snippets:
- The Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver runs in a Kubernetes cluster deployed in vSphere to provision persistent volumes on vSphere storage.
- The CSI driver runs in a native Kubernetes cluster deployed in vSphere to provision persistent volumes on vSphere storage.
- A newly created user cluster must have at least one node pool to transition to a healthy state. module "enable google apis primary" { source = "terraform-google-modules/project-factory/google//modules/project services" version = " > 18.0" project id = var.project id activate apis = [ "cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com" , "anthos.googleapis.com" , "anthosgke.googleapis.com" , "container.googleapis.com" , "gkeconnect.googleapis.com" , "gkehub.googleapis.com" , "serviceusage.googleapis.com" , "stackdriver.googleapis.com" , "monitoring.googleapis.com" , "logging.googleapis.com" , "iam.googleapis.com" , "compute.googleapis.com" , "anthosaudit.googleapis.com" , "opsconfigmonitoring.googleapis.com" , "file.googleapis.com" , "connectgateway.googleapis.com" ] disable services on destroy = false } Enable GKE OnPrem API resource "google project service" "default" { project = var.project id service = "gkeonprem.googleapis.com" disable on destroy = false } This module is used to update the platform controller on your admin cluster.

Evidence snippets:
- Example Windows storage class: kind : StorageClass apiVersion : storage . k8s . io / v1 metadata : name : my - storage - class provisioner : kubernetes . io / vsphere - volume parameters : datastore : my - datastore diskformat : thin fstype : ntfs CSI proxy is deployed automatically onto Windows nodes.
- This tarball contains the log files on nodes as well as outputs for troubleshooting commands running on the node. gkectl diagnose snapshot --scenario system-with-logs --cluster-name [USER CLUSTER NAME] --kubeconfig [PATH TO KUBECONFIG] Windows VM creation fails Check the logs from the vsphere-controller-manager container in the clusterapi-controllers Pod in the user namespace of the admin cluster. kubectl --kubeconfig ADMIN CLUSTER KUBECONFIG -n USER CLUSTER NAME logs clusterapi-controllers- POD NAME SUFFIX vsphere-controller-manager Ensure that your VM template is located in the same datacenter and datastore as specified in your user cluster configuration file.
- You can verify whether the Windows VMs in the current network can contact the AD domain DNS server by running this command: PS C:\> nslookup DOMAIN NAME DOMAIN SERVER IP Server: example-1-2-3-4.anthos Address: 1.2.3.4 Name: example.org Address: 1.2.3.4 Step 1: Create Windows VM template with a customized script Execute a customized script before the Windows node joins the user cluster for Active Directory domain join.
- Windows persistent storage When working with Windows Server containers with persistent storage, you must create a StorageClass object, and specify the name of that object in the storageClassName field of the PersistentVolumeClaim object, because the default StorageClass in on-prem user cluster uses ext4 as the file system type, which only works for Linux containers.
