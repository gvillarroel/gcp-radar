- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Overview The goal of the custom extractor is to enable Document AI users to build custom entity extraction solutions for new document types for which no pre-trained processors are available.
- Training method Document examples Document layout variation Free form text or paragraphs Number of training documents for production-ready quality, depending on variability Fine tune and foundation model (generative AI).
- Home Documentation AI and ML Document AI Guides Send feedback Custom extractor overview Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- Custom extractor includes a combination of layout-aware deep learning models (for generative AI and custom models) and template-based models.

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 257
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- This is because the default custom extractor model type is a foundation model, which can perform zero-shot prediction, that is, without training.
- At least 10 training instances and 10 test instances of each field are required for a custom model based processor.
- In the Create processor menu, enter a name for your processor, such as my-custom-document-extractor .
- Train custom model based processor Training might take several hours.

- For processor versions based on Gemini 1.5 and later, such as custom extractors pretrained-foundation-model-v1.2-2024-05-10 , you can import fine-tuned processor versions.
- If you create a processor version by training a smaller, custom model (either model or template based), then the type is Custom .
