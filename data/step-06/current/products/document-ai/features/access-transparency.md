- There are three ways to train a generative AI model: Training method Zero-shot Few-shot Fine-tuning Accuracy Medium Medium-high High Effort Low Low Medium Recommended number of training documents 0 5 to 10 10 to 50+ Note: You can expect reasonably good results with 10 to 50+ training examples, and performance can be further optimized by increasing the number of examples to hundreds or thousands, depending on the complexity and variation of the documents and extraction tasks.

### Label documents \_|\_ Document AI \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Final score: 183
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If your Cloud Storage is in a different Google Cloud project, make sure to grant access so that Document AI is allowed to write files to that location.
- Train after labeling all suggested documents Move to Train now on the information bar.
- Labeling options Here are your options for labeling documents: Manual : manually label your documents in the Google Cloud console Auto-labeling : use an existing processor version to generate labels Import pre-labeled documents : save time if you already have labeled documents Manually label in the Google Cloud console In the Train tab, select a document to open the labeling tool.
- Dataset metadata, such as processor schema, document assignments (training/test/unassigned), and document labeling status (labeled, unlabeled, auto-labeled) are not exported.
