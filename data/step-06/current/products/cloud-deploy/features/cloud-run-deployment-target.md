Evidence snippets:

- Canary-deploy an application to a target This quickstart shows you how to use Cloud Deploy to deliver a sample application image in a canary deployment to either Google Kubernetes Engine or to Cloud Run. (You can also run a canary deployment to GKE attached clusters , but only GKE and Cloud Run are shown in this quickstart.) A canary deployment splits traffic between an already-deployed version of the application and the new version.
