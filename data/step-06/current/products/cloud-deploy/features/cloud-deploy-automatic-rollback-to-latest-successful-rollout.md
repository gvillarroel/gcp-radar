Evidence snippets:
- Available automation rules The following automation rules are available in Cloud Deploy: Rule Description timedPromoteReleaseRule Automatically promote from one target to the next based on a cron schedule. promoteReleaseRule Automatically promotes a release into the indicated target after successful rollout in the previous target in the progression. advanceRolloutRule Automatically advances a rollout from the indicated phase to the next phase. repairRolloutRule Automatically retry the failed job or jobs in the rollout a specified number of times, and roll back if all retries fail.
- If all retry attempts fail, a rollback is started by creating a new rollout to deploy the target's most recent successful release to that target.
- Abort a repairRolloutRule automation run If you run any of the following commands on your rollout, the repairRolloutRule automation is aborted: Retry job Cancel rollout Ignore job Terminate job run Example The following is an example of an automation configuration with a repairRolloutRule : apiVersion : deploy.cloud.google.com/v1 kind : Automation metadata : name : regular-repair/regular description : repair regular rollouts suspended : false serviceAccount : (REDACTED) selector : targets : - id : t1 rules : - repairRolloutRule : id : "repair-rollout" repairPhases : - retry : attempts : 3 wait : 1m backoffMode : LINEAR - rollback : destinationPhase : "stable" In this automation, if a rollout fails on the identified target, that rollout is retried up to 3 times, with a one-minute wait between retry attempt.
- For example, if you have three targets, you can set up this rule so that when the release is successfully deployed into the first target, it's automatically promoted to the second target.
