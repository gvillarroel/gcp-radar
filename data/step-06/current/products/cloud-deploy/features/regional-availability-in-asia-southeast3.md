- By default, Cloud Deploy creates a Cloud Storage bucket, in the same region as the Cloud Deploy resources, taking the following form: <location>.deploy-artifacts.<project ID>.appspot.com Default Cloud Build timeout By default, Cloud Build has a timeout of 1 hour on operations it performs for Cloud Deploy.
- This configuration makes it possible to share private worker pools among targets, and allows cross-regional dependencies.
- Cloud Deploy lets you configure targets with private pools in other regions.
- Note: Cloud Build private worker pools are regional resources.
