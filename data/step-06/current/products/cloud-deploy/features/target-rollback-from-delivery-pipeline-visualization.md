# Target rollback from delivery pipeline visualization

Product: Cloud Deploy
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

Cloud Deploy added the ability to roll back targets directly from the delivery pipeline visualization in Google Cloud Console.

## Extended Definition

Cloud Deploy added the ability to roll back targets directly from the delivery pipeline visualization in Google Cloud Console.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

Evidence snippets:
- If you omit this property from the delivery-pipeline config, or provide no value for it, deploying to this target doesn't require approval. (But the caller trying to promote to the target still needs the clouddeploy.rollouts.create IAM permission.) You can even require manual approval on the first target.
- A single-file example The command in this example registers a delivery pipeline and targets that are all defined in the same file: gcloud deploy apply -- file = clouddeploy . yaml -- region = us - central1 An example using separate files For this example, there are three targets defined in three separate files, so you run four commands: gcloud deploy apply -- file = delivery - pipeline . yaml -- region = us - central1 && \ gcloud deploy apply -- file = target dev . yaml -- region = us - central1 && \ gcloud deploy apply -- file = target staging . yaml -- region = us - central1 && \ gcloud deploy apply -- file = target prod . yaml -- region = us - central1 The --region flag is required unless you've set a default (using gcloud config set deploy/region [REGION] ).
- The following command registers a delivery pipeline with its targets defined in the same file. gcloud deploy apply -- file = PIPELINE CONFIG \ -- region = LOCATION \ -- project = PROJECT You now have a delivery pipeline that can manage deployment of your releases, and target resources that can be used by any delivery pipeline in the same project and region.
- This is useful for trying out Cloud Deploy, but is not suitable for production workloads. (You can also use the Google Cloud console to create a release .) To create the delivery pipeline: From the Delivery pipelines page, click Create .

### "Quickstart: Canary-deploy an application to a target \_|\_ Cloud Deploy\

Evidence snippets:
- In this quickstart, we create one file for our pipeline and our single target: GKE Create a file named clouddeploy.yaml , in the deploy-canary-quickstart-gke directory, with the following contents: apiVersion: deploy.cloud.google.com/v1 kind: DeliveryPipeline metadata: name: my-canary-demo-app-1 description: main application pipeline serialPipeline: stages: - targetId: prod profiles: [] strategy: canary: runtimeConfig: kubernetes: serviceNetworking: service: "my-service" deployment: "my-deployment" canaryDeployment: percentages: [50] verify: false --- apiVersion: deploy.cloud.google.com/v1 kind: Target metadata: name: prod description: prod GKE cluster gke: cluster: projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/us-central1/clusters/canary-quickstart-cluster GKE + Gateway API Create a file named clouddeploy.yaml , in the deploy-canary-quickstart-gke-gatewayapi directory, with the following contents: apiVersion: deploy.cloud.google.com/v1 kind: DeliveryPipeline metadata: name: my-canary-demo-app-1 description: main application pipeline serialPipeline: stages: - targetId: prod profiles: [] strategy: canary: runtimeConfig: kubernetes: gatewayServiceMesh: httpRoute: "my-httproute" service: "my-service" deployment: "my-deployment" canaryDeployment: percentages: [50] verify: false --- apiVersion: deploy.cloud.google.com/v1 kind: Target metadata: name: prod description: prod GKE cluster gke: cluster: projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/us-central1/clusters/canary-quickstart-cluster Cloud Run Create a file named clouddeploy.yaml , in the deploy-canary-quickstart-run directory, with the following contents: apiVersion: deploy.cloud.google.com/v1 kind: DeliveryPipeline metadata: name: my-canary-demo-app-1 description: main application pipeline serialPipeline: stages: - targetId: prod profiles: [] strategy: canary: runtimeConfig: cloudRun: automaticTrafficControl: true canaryDeployment: percentages: [50] verify: false --- apiVersion: deploy.cloud.google.com/v1 kind: Target metadata: name: prod description: prod Run Service run: location: projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/us-central1 Register your pipeline and targets with the Cloud Deploy service: gcloud deploy apply -- file = clouddeploy . yaml -- region = us - central1 -- project = PROJECT ID You now have a pipeline, with one target configured for a canary deployment strategy.
- To create a new release , run the following command from the deploy-canary-quickstart-gke , deploy-canary-quickstart-gke-gatewayapi or deploy-canary-quickstart-run directory: GKE gcloud deploy releases create test - release - 002 \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --region=us-central1 \ --delivery-pipeline=my-canary-demo-app-1 \ --images=my-app-image=gcr.io/google-containers/nginx@sha256:f49a843c290594dcf4d193535d1f4ba8af7d56cea2cf79d1e9554f077f1e7aaa GKE + Gateway API gcloud deploy releases create test - release - 002 \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --region=us-central1 \ --delivery-pipeline=my-canary-demo-app-1 \ --images=my-app-image=gcr.io/google-containers/nginx@sha256:f49a843c290594dcf4d193535d1f4ba8af7d56cea2cf79d1e9554f077f1e7aaa Cloud Run gcloud deploy releases create test - release - 002 \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --region=us-central1 \ --delivery-pipeline=my-canary-demo-app-1 \ --images=my-app-image=us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello@sha256:95ade4b17adcd07623b0a0c68359e344fe54e65d0cb01b989e24c39f2fcd296a After a few minutes, a rollout is created, and this time the canary stage is executed: When the first rollout phase finishes, the rollout is now in the canary phase: This means that the application is now deployed to 50%.
- To create a release resource that represents the container image to deploy, run the following command from the deploy-canary-quickstart-gke , deploy-canary-quickstart-gke-gatewayapi , or deploy-canary-quickstart-run directory: GKE gcloud deploy releases create test - release - 001 \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --region=us-central1 \ --delivery-pipeline=my-canary-demo-app-1 \ --images=my-app-image=gcr.io/google-containers/nginx@sha256:f49a843c290594dcf4d193535d1f4ba8af7d56cea2cf79d1e9554f077f1e7aaa GKE + Gateway API gcloud deploy releases create test - release - 001 \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --region=us-central1 \ --delivery-pipeline=my-canary-demo-app-1 \ --images=my-app-image=gcr.io/google-containers/nginx@sha256:f49a843c290594dcf4d193535d1f4ba8af7d56cea2cf79d1e9554f077f1e7aaa Cloud Run gcloud deploy releases create test - release - 001 \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --region=us-central1 \ --delivery-pipeline=my-canary-demo-app-1 \ --images=my-app-image=us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello@sha256:95ade4b17adcd07623b0a0c68359e344fe54e65d0cb01b989e24c39f2fcd296a Notice the --images= flag , which you use to replace the placeholder ( my-app-image ) in the manifest or service definition with the specific, SHA-qualified image.
