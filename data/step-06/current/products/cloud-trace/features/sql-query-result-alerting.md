Evidence snippets:
- Evaluation types for SQL-based alerting policies Conditions that monitor a SQL query result support two types of evaluation: Row count threshold : The condition is met when the number of rows in the query result is greater than, equal to, or less than a threshold value.
- Query failures Queries issued by SQL-based alerting policies can fail for various reasons, including the following: The Monitoring Service Account no longer exists or it no longer has the necessary permissions to read the trace data that is being queried.
- Before you create a SQL-based alerting policy, complete the following steps: To get the permissions that you need to query trace data and create SQL-based alerting policies, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your project: Query trace data: Cloud Trace User ( roles/cloudtrace.user ) Create SQL-based alerting policies: Monitoring Editor ( roles/monitoring.editor ) Logging SqlAlertWriter ( roles/logging.sqlAlertWriter ) Verify that the Monitoring Service Account exists and that it has the following roles: Monitoring Service Agent ( roles/monitoring.notificationServiceAgent ) on your project.
- Alerting policies that monitor a SQL query result must have only one condition.

- Test the policy Try to create an alerting policy with documentation that excludes the resource project name. gcloud monitoring policies create \ --display-name="CPU Utilization - 5% Threshold" \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --condition-display-name="Condition 1" \ --condition-filter='resource.type="gce instance" AND metric.type="compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization"' \ --duration='60s' \ --if='>5' \ --combiner='AND' \ --documentation='The ${ metric . display name } of the ${ resource . type } ${ resource . label . instance id } has exceeded 5% for over 60 seconds.' \ Replace PROJECT ID with your project ID.
- Apply the constraint: gcloud org-policies set-custom-constraint /constraint-alert-doc-has-project.yaml Verify that the constraint exists: gcloud org-policies list-custom-constraints --organization = ORGANIZATION ID The output is similar to the following: CUSTOM CONSTRAINT: custom.alertDocHasProject ACTION TYPE: DENY METHOD TYPES: CREATE,UPDATE RESOURCE TYPES: monitoring.googleapis.com/AlertPolicy DISPLAY NAME: Alerting policy documentation must include the project name.
