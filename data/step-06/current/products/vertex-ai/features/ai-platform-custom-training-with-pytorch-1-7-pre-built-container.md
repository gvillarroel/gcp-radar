Evidence snippets:
- On the Training container step, provide Vertex AI with information it needs to use the training package that you uploaded to Cloud Storage: Select Prebuilt container .
- To learn more, run the following notebooks in the environment of your choice: "Use the Vertex AI SDK for Python to train and deploy a custom image classification model for batch prediction.": Open in Colab Open in Colab Enterprise Open in Vertex AI Workbench View on GitHub "Use the Vertex AI SDK for Python to train and deploy a custom image classification model for online prediction.": Open in Colab Open in Colab Enterprise Open in Vertex AI Workbench View on GitHub This page shows you how to run a TensorFlow Keras training application on Vertex AI.
- You can now view your new training pipeline , which is named hello custom , on the Training page. (You might need to refresh the page.) The training pipeline does two main things: The training pipeline creates a custom job resource named hello custom-custom-job .
- Activate Cloud Shell In the Cloud Shell session, run the following command: cd hello-custom-sample Run a custom training pipeline This section describes using the training package that you uploaded to Cloud Storage to run a Vertex AI custom training pipeline.

- Under the Training Container section, select either prebuilt or custom container, depending on how you packaged your application.
- Recommended training application structure If you choose to package up your code as a Python source distribution or as a custom container, it's recommended that you structure your application as follows: training-application-dir/ ....setup.py ....Dockerfile trainer/ ....task.py ....model.py ....utils.py Create a directory to store all of your training application code, in this case, training-application-dir .
- You can use this option if all of the code needed to execute your training application is in one Python file and one of the prebuilt Vertex AI training containers has all of the libraries needed to run your application.
