- In the console, you should see a new pipeline run in the Pipelines page: Go to Pipeline Runs After the pipeline run is complete, you should see either a new model named taxifare-prediction-model or a new model version in Vertex AI Model Registry: Go to Model Registry You should also see a new batch prediction job: Go to Batch Predictions Automatically run the pipeline There are two ways to automatically run the pipeline: on a schedule or when new data is inserted into the dataset.
- VertexModel , metadata = { "resourceName" : parent model resource name }, ) . after ( import unmanaged model task ) Upload the model as a version model version upload op = ModelUploadOp ( project = project , location = location , display name = model display name , parent model = import registry model task . outputs [ "artifact" ], unmanaged container model = import unmanaged model task . outputs [ "artifact" ], ) with dsl .
- This pipeline executes the custom training package, uploads the model to the Vertex AI Model Registry, runs the evaluation job, and sends an email notification.
