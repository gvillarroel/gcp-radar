- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Type of issue Common issues Reconciliation Resource keeps updating every 5-15 mins Resource has no status KNV2005: syncer excessively updating resource Resource deleted by Config Connector Controller Pod OOMKilled Deletion Deletions of namespaces stuck at Terminating Deletions of resources stuck at DeleteFailed after project was deleted Permissions Compute Engine Metadata not defined Error 403: Request had insufficient authentication scopes 403 Forbidden: The caller does not have permission Error 403: Caller is missing IAM permission Update error with IAMPolicy, IAMPartialPolicy and IAMPolicyMember Installation and upgrades Version not supported in Config Connector add-on installations failed calling webhook PodSecurityPolicy prevents upgrades Configuration Cannot make changes to immutable fields No matches for kind "Foo" Labels are not propagated to the Google Cloud resource Error due to special characters in resource name Unable to remove fields from resource spec Reconciliation The following section lists common issues related to reconciliation of resources by Config Connector.
- Check that Config Connector is running To check that Config Connector is running, verify that all of its Pods are READY : kubectl get pod -n cnrm-system Example output: NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE cnrm-controller-manager-0 1/1 Running 0 1h cnrm-deletiondefender-0 1/1 Running 0 1h cnrm-resource-stats-recorder-77dc8cc4b6-mgpgp 1/1 Running 0 1h cnrm-webhook-manager-58496b66f9-pqwhz 1/1 Running 0 1h cnrm-webhook-manager-58496b66f9-wdcn4 1/1 Running 0 1h If you have Config Connector installed in namespaced-mode , then you will have one controller ( cnrm-controller-manager ) Pod for each namespace that is responsible for managing the Config Connector resources in that namespace.
- Since deleting a resource's finalizers allows the resource to be immediately deleted from the Kubernetes cluster, Config Connector might (but not necessarily) not get a chance to complete the deletion of the underlying Google Cloud resource.
- Warning: This operation should be done as a last resort since deletions of finalizers is outside the bounds of normal usage for Config Connector and could have unintended consequences.

### "Managing resources with the resourceID field \_|\_ Config Connector \_|\_\

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 109
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Acquiring a folder To acquire a folder using Config Connector with the resourceID field, complete the following steps: Copy the following contents into a file named folder.yaml . apiVersion : resourcemanager.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1 kind : Folder metadata : annotations : cnrm.cloud.google.com/organization-id : ORG ID Remove the deletion-policy annotation if it is safe to delete the folder when the resource is deleted from your cluster. cnrm.cloud.google.com/deletion-policy : "abandon" name : folder-sample-for-acquisition spec : resourceID : ACQUIRED FOLDER ID displayName : ACQUIRED FOLDER DISPLAY NAME Replace the following: ORG ID with the numeric ID for your organization.
- The name of the Config Connector resource is pubsub-topic-sample and the name of the Pub/Sub topic is pubsub-topic-id . apiVersion : pubsub.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1 kind : PubSubTopic metadata : name : pubsub-topic-sample spec : resourceID : pubsub-topic-id Creating a resource with the resourceID field Note: When you manage a Google Cloud resource with the resourceID field, if the resource has a service-generated resource ID, Config Connector assumes the resource already exists and tries to acquire the resource.
- Acquiring a resource with the resourceID field When you manage a Google Cloud resource with the resourceID field, Config Connector acquires the resource if: The resource has a user-specified resource ID, and the values in the manifest and the resource name match an existing resource; Or, The resource has a service-generated resource ID.
- Copy the following contents into a file named bigquery-dataset.yaml . apiVersion : bigquery.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1 kind : BigQueryDataset metadata : name : bigquerydataset-sample-for-creation spec : resourceID : bigquerydataset sample with resourceid defaultTableExpirationMs : 3600000 description : "BigQuery Dataset Sample with the ResourceID Field" friendlyName : bigquerydataset-sample-with-resourceid location : US Apply the YAML file to your cluster. kubectl apply --namespace CC NAMESPACE -f bigquery-dataset.yaml Replace CC NAMESPACE with the namespace Config Connector manages resources from.

### "Configure container resources and replicas \_|\_ Config Connector \_|\_\

Evidence snippets:
- The following components are always cluster-scoped, even when Config Connector is installed in namespaced mode: cnrm-webhook-manager cnrm-deletiondefender cnrm-resource-stats-recorder cnrm-unmanaged-detector The cnrm-controller-manager is also cluster-scoped when Config Connector is installed in cluster mode.
- You can configure the following controllers: cnrm-webhook-manager cnrm-controller-manager cnrm-deletiondefender cnrm-resource-stats-recorder cnrm-unmanaged-detector (Config Connector version 1.108 and later) There are two types of custom resources used for configuration: ControllerResource and NamespacedControllerResource .
- After deletion, the Config Connector operator recreates the controllers with the default container resources and replicas. kubectl delete -f configure-webhook-manager.yaml Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- For example, to configure the memory request and limit of the webhook container of the cnrm-webhook-manager controller, create and apply the following YAML file: apiVersion : customize.core.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1 kind : ControllerResource metadata : name : cnrm-webhook-manager spec : containers : - name : webhook resources : limits : memory : 512Mi requests : memory : 256Mi Use NamespacedControllerResource for the namespaced controller manager Use the NamespacedControllerResource custom resource only to configure resources for the cnrm-controller-manager when Config Connector is running in namespaced mode.
