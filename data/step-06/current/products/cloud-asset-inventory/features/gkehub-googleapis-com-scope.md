- Currently supported enrichment types with v1.searchAllResources API: RESOURCE OWNERS The corresponding read masks in order to get the enrichment: enrichments.resource owners The corresponding required permissions: cloudasset.assets.searchEnrichmentResourceOwners Example query to get resource owner enrichment: scope: "projects/my-project" query: "name: my-project" assetTypes: "cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project" readMask: { paths: "assetType" paths: "name" paths: "enrichments.resource owners" } parentAssetType string The type of this resource's immediate parent, if there is one.
- Example: osconfig.googleapis.com/Inventory You can find the supported attached asset types of each resource in this table: https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types versionedResources[] object ( VersionedResource ) Versioned resource representations of this attached resource.
- HTTP request GET https://cloudasset.googleapis.com/v1/{scope= / }:searchAllResources The URL uses gRPC Transcoding syntax.
- Use the kmsKeys field to retrieve Cloud KMS key information. kmsKeys:key to find Google Cloud resources encrypted with customer-managed encryption keys whose name contains the word key . relationships:instance-group-1 to find Google Cloud resources that have relationships with instance-group-1 in the related resource name. relationships:INSTANCE TO INSTANCEGROUP to find Compute Engine instances that have relationships of type INSTANCE TO INSTANCEGROUP . relationships.INSTANCE TO INSTANCEGROUP:instance-group-1 to find Compute Engine instances that have relationships with instance-group-1 in the Compute Engine instance group resource name, for relationship type INSTANCE TO INSTANCEGROUP . sccSecurityMarks.key=value to find Cloud resources that are attached with security marks whose key is key and value is value . sccSecurityMarks.key: to find Cloud resources that are attached with security marks whose key is key . state:ACTIVE to find Google Cloud resources whose state contains ACTIVE as a word.
