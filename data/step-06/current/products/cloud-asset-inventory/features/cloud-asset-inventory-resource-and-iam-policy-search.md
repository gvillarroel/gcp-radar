- For example, assume we have the following cases in one IAM policy binding: - Permission P1 and P2 apply to resource R1 and R2; - Permission P3 applies to resource R2 and R3; This will result in the following access control lists: - AccessControlList 1: [R1, R2], [P1, P2] - AccessControlList 2: [R2, R3], [P3] JSON representation { "resources" : [ { object ( Resource ) } ] , "accesses" : [ { object ( Access ) } ] , "resourceEdges" : [ { object ( Edge ) } ] , "conditionEvaluation" : { object ( ConditionEvaluation ) } } Fields resources[] object ( Resource ) The resources that match one of the following conditions: - The resourceSelector, if it is specified in request; - Otherwise, resources reachable from the policy attached resource. accesses[] object ( Access ) The accesses that match one of the following conditions: - The accessSelector, if it is specified in request; - Otherwise, access specifiers reachable from the policy binding's role. resourceEdges[] object ( Edge ) Resource edges of the graph starting from the policy attached resource to any descendant resources.
- JSON representation { "attachedResourceFullName" : string , "iamBinding" : { object ( Binding ) } , "accessControlLists" : [ { object ( AccessControlList ) } ] , "identityList" : { object ( IdentityList ) } , "fullyExplored" : boolean } Fields attachedResourceFullName string The full resource name of the resource to which the iamBinding policy attaches. iamBinding object ( Binding ) The IAM policy binding under analysis. accessControlLists[] object ( AccessControlList ) The access control lists derived from the iamBinding that match or potentially match resource and access selectors specified in the request. identityList object ( IdentityList ) The identity list derived from members of the iamBinding that match or potentially match identity selector specified in the request. fullyExplored boolean Represents whether all analyses on the iamBinding have successfully finished.
