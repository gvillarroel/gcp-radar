- To move from your own SSL certificates to Google-managed SSL certificates, or to add managed SSL certificates to an existing app with a custom domain, update your domain mapping: In the Google Cloud console, go to App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains : Go to Custom Domains Select the domain you want to secure, and click Enable managed security .
- App Engine SSL support offers globally distributed SSL endpoints and built-in load balancing to serve your app securely, reliably, and quickly to a worldwide audience.
- To obtain a certificate for use with your App Engine app: Generate your private key and a certificate signing request (CSR) by using the openssl tool: Run the following command from a directory where you want to create the server.csr file: openssl req - nodes - newkey rsa : 2048 - keyout [ MY PRIVATE KEY ] . key - out [ MY CSR ] . csr where: [MY PRIVATE KEY].key is the generated file where your private key is stored.

- An App Engine app is configured using an app.yaml file, that contains CPU, memory, network and disk resources, scaling, and other general settings including environment variables.
- For example, if you name your app.yaml file service-name-app.yaml or app.flexible.yaml , then you must deploy your app using either: gcloud app deploy service-name-app.yaml gcloud app deploy app.flexible.yaml All configuration elements For a complete list of all the supported elements in this configuration file, see the app.yaml reference .
