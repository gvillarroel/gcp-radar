- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-2`
- Final score: 48
- Re-rank relevance: WEAK
- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- The regions are as follows: us-west2 us-east4 northamerica-northeast1 southamerica-east1 europe-west2 europe-west3 asia-south1 asia-northeast1 australia-southeast1 App Engine custom domains use a pool of shared IP addresses for all applications.
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
- Updating DNS records at your domain registrar Note: If you have a custom domain set up for your App Engine app and want to move it to a different Google Cloud project, you do not need to update your custom domain DNS records as these will remain fixed for the domain when you switch projects.
- Deleting custom domains from your app In order to delete a custom domain mapping from your app, your account must have the App Engine Admin role ( roles/appengine.appAdmin ) or a custom role that contains the appengine.applications.update permission.

Evidence snippets:
- Service IP range for requests sent to the App Engine standard environment IP range for requests sent to the App Engine flexible environment App Engine Cron 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32 Compute Engine instances with external IP addresses External IP address of the instance External IP address of the instance Compute Engine instances without an external IP address 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Compute Engine instances without an external IP address using Cloud NAT for outbound connections 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Cloud Scheduler jobs using App Engine HTTP and App Engine tasks in Cloud Tasks (including App Engine Task Queues) 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.2/32 Cloud Storage or Blobstore 0.1.0.30/32 Not applicable URL Fetch 0.1.0.40/32 0.1.0.40/32 Warming requests 0.1.0.3/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny Not applicable Depending on your use case, these additional instructions might apply when configuring App Engine firewall rules: Requests from newly created or updated App Engine Cron jobs sent to either the App Engine standard or flexible environment come from 0.1.0.2 .
- Direction of traffic : Ingress Action on match : Allow Source IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 and 130.211.0.0/22 Protocols and ports : tcp : 8443 (for legacy health checks) or 10402 (for split health checks) Priority : 1000 Preventing access to cached content The App Engine firewall sits behind mechanisms that cache content, for example web proxies and browsers.
- App Engine flexible example Your app running in the flexible environment has two services: frontend service and backend service , and has a firewall configured to deny traffic by default. frontend service uses Cloud Tasks with App Engine HTTP to send messages to backend service .
- If there are VPC-based firewall rules (such as VPC firewall rules or hierarchical firewall policies ) configured in your network environment, both VPC-level firewalls and App Engine firewalls need to allow an incoming request's IP range for your App Engine app to receive it.
