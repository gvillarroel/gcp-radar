Evidence snippets:
- App Engine locations App Engine is regional , which means the infrastructure that runs your apps is located in a specific region, and Google manages it so that it is available redundantly across all of the zones within that region .
- You can generally select the region nearest to your app's users, but you should consider the locations where App Engine is available as well as the locations of the other Google Cloud products and services that your app uses.
- By default, App Engine uses the latest available LTS .NET version if you don't specify a runtime version in your app.yaml file.
- To initialize the gcloud CLI, run the following command: gcloud init Required roles To get the permissions that you need to complete this quickstart, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: App Engine Admin ( roles/appengine.appAdmin ) on the project Cloud Build Editor ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor ) on the project Storage Object Admin ( roles/storage.objectAdmin ) on the project Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) on the project Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) on the service account Ask your administrator to grant the following roles for the App Engine default service account: Artifact Registry Reader ( roles/artifactregistry.reader ) on the project Cloud Build Service Account ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder ) on the project Storage Object Viewer ( roles/storage.objectViewer ) on the project For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
