Evidence snippets:
- App Engine Locations App Engine is regional , which means the infrastructure that runs your apps is located in a specific region, and Google manages it so that it is available redundantly across all of the zones within that region .
- You can generally select the region nearest to your app's users, but you should consider the locations where App Engine is available as well as the locations of the other Google Cloud products and services that your app uses.
- Enable billing in your new Google Cloud project by creating a new billing account or setting an existing one: Go to Billing Download and install the Google Cloud CLI and then initialize the gcloud CLI: Download the SDK Run the following gcloud command to create an App Engine application and specify in which geographical region that you want your app to run: gcloud app create Due to changes in the default behavior for how Cloud Build uses service accounts in new projects, and secure-by-default organization policy changes , you might need to grant additional roles to your deploying service account.
- OK Download the Hello World app Choose one of the following to download the Hello World sample app from GitHub, to your local machine: Clone the Hello World sample app from the following repository: git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-custom-runtimes-samples Download the sample as a .zip file and then extract it to a local directory.

Evidence snippets:
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- The following example demonstrates how to designate all png files as static files (except those in the data/ directory and all of its subdirectories): < static - files > < include path = "/ .png" / > < exclude path = "/data/ .png" / > < / static - files > You can also set HTTP headers to use when responding to requests to these static resources. < static - files > < include path = "/my static-files" > < http - header name = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value = "http://example.org" / > < / include > < / static - files > Note: If the path string doesn't start with a slash, then the HTTP headers, if any, work on App Engine but do not work on the Development Server.
- To serve custom error pages, add a <static-error-handlers> section to your appengine-web.xml , as ins this example: <static-error-handlers> <handler file="default error.html" /> <handler file="over quota.html" error-code="over quota" /> </static-error-handlers> Warning : Make sure that the path to the error response file does not overlap with static file handler paths.
- If for some reason you prefer that your app not use precompilation, you can turn it off by adding the following to your appengine-web.xml file: <precompilation-enabled>false</precompilation-enabled> <module> Note: Modules are now named Services and services are still declared in appengine-web.xml files as modules, for example: <module>service name</module> .
