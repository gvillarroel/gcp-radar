# Automatic scaling default max instances

Product: App Engine standard environment Ruby
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Automatic scaling default max instances sets the default maximum number of instances for new standard environment deployments.

## Extended Definition

Automatic scaling default max instances sets the default maximum number of instances for new standard environment deployments.

Evidence snippets:
- Note: For new projects you create after March 2025, App Engine sets the automatic scaling maximum instances default for standard environment deployments to 20.
- By default, your app uses automatic scaling, which means App Engine will manage the number of idle instances.
- Scaling types App Engine supports the following scaling types , which controls how and when instances are created: Automatic (default) Basic Manual You specify the scaling type in your app's app.yaml .
- Automatic scaling settings Description Target CPU utilization Sets the CPU utilization ratio threshold to specify the CPU usage threshold at which more instances will be started to handle traffic.

Evidence snippets:
- The following values are available depending on your service's scaling : Automatic scaling F1 , F2 , F4 , F4 1G Default: F1 Optionally use the automatic scaling element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as minimum and maximum number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections.
- Specify this element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as setting minimum and maximum levels for number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections for a service.
- The number of concurrent requests an automatic scaling instance can accept before the scheduler spawns a new instance (Default: 10, Maximum: 1000).
- Note: For new projects you create after March 2025, App Engine sets the maximum instances default for standard environment deployments to 20.

Evidence snippets:
- Limit Free app Paid app Maximum services per app 5 210 Maximum versions per app 15 210 There is also a limit to the number of instances for each service with basic or manual scaling: Maximum instances per manual/basic scaling version Free app Paid app US Paid app EU 20 25 (200 for us-central ) 25 There is also a limit to the number of instances across standard versions that can be running per project and region.
- The following limits apply to task queues according to their type: Push Queue Limits Maximum task size 100KB Queue execution rate 500 task invocations per second per queue Maximum countdown/ETA for a task 30 days from the current date and time Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a batch 100 tasks Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a transaction 5 tasks Default maximum number of task queues 100 queues.
- Resource Free Quota F1 instances 28 free instance hours per day B1 instances 9 free instance hours per day Accrual of instance hours begins when an instance starts and ends as described below, depending on the type of scaling you specify for the instance: Basic or automatic scaling: accrual ends fifteen minutes after an instance finishes processing its last request.
- Task Queue When a task executes, its associated requests count toward the application request quotas These limits apply to all task queues: Resource Daily limit Maximum rate Task Queue management calls (using the Google Cloud console) 10,000 n/a Resource Default limit Maximum number of queues (includes both push and pull queues but not the default queue) 100 queues.
