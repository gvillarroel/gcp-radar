# Task queue retry_limit zero handling

Product: App Engine standard environment Ruby
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Failed tasks in queues configured with retry_limit set to zero are no longer retried.

## Extended Definition

Failed tasks in queues configured with retry_limit set to zero are no longer retried.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

Evidence snippets:
- This table compares the performance features of the three scaling types: Feature Automatic scaling Basic scaling Manual scaling Request timeout 10 minutes for HTTP requests and task queue tasks.
- 24 hours for HTTP requests and task queue tasks.
- Some instance shutdown log messages you might see include: [ start ] Quitting on terminated signal [ INFO ] Handling signal : term [ INFO ] Worker exiting ( pid : 21 ) [ INFO ] Worker exiting ( pid : 24 ) [ INFO ] Shutting down : Master [ start ] Start program failed : termination triggered by nginx exit These log messages do not indicate any error condition but are indications of the normal instance shut down process.
- Scaling and batches of requests If you are sending batches of requests to your services, for example, to a task queue for processing, a large number of instances will be created quickly.

- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- When a service receives standard HTTP traffic at high volume while also serving Task queue or Cloud Tasks traffic at much lower volume, there is a disproportionate impact on the latency of the Task queue or the Cloud Tasks traffic.
- Requests from App Engine Cloud Tasks also share this pending queue priority behavior for compatibility reasons.
- Within the pending queue, App Engine treats requests from HTTP target Cloud Tasks as regular HTTP traffic.
- App Engine pending queue prioritization During periods of heavy traffic, App Engine might place requests in a pending queue while waiting for an available instance with the following prioritization: App Engine prioritizes other queued requests over pending queued requests from Task queue .
