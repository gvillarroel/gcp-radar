Evidence snippets:
- For example, you can create a dispatch file to route mobile requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/mobile/ to a mobile frontend, and route worker requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/work/ to a static backend: dispatch: Send all mobile traffic to the mobile frontend. - url: " /mobile/ " service: mobile-frontend Send all work to the one static backend. - url: " /work/ " service: static-backend Deploying the dispatch file To deploy the dispatch file using gcloud , run the following command: gcloud app deploy dispatch.yaml Routing with Cloud Load Balancing Cloud Load Balancing is a separate product that enables advanced network configurations for all of your applications running on Google Cloud.
- Inconsistent metrics when App Engine flexible environment uses Cloud Load Balancing The App Engine flexible environment dashboard displays all metrics only for requests routed through a flexible environment managed backend.
- If you use App Engine flexible environment with Cloud Load Balancing, then certain metrics in the App Engine metrics table are reported as metrics from the loadbalancing table instead.
- Note the following: We recommend that you use ingress controls so that your app only receives requests sent from the load balancer (and the VPC if you use it).
