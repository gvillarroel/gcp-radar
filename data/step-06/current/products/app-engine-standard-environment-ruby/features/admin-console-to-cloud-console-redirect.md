Evidence snippets:
- This solution is best if you want to authenticate users based on their Google Account, or if you are using Google Admin console for your domain.
- Firebase Authentication supports the largest number of users while maintaining the smallest amount of code.
- Go Java Node.js PHP Python Ruby To authenticate users in Google Cloud applications, Google offers the following user authentication methods: Authentication Service Summary Identity Platform (recommended) Authenticate users using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and any provider that supports SAML or OpenID Connect protocol.
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Authenticating users Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Evidence snippets:
- You can also use auth fail action to configure the app to simply reject requests for a handler from users who are not properly authenticated, instead of redirecting the user to the sign-in page.
- Example The following is an example of an app.yaml file: runtime : python314 instance class : F2 env variables : BUCKET NAME : "example-gcs-bucket" handlers : Matches requests to /images/... to files in static/images/... - url : /images static dir : static/images - url : /. secure : always redirect http response code : 301 script : auto The following table provides YAML examples of available fields in an app.yaml file: Runtime and app elements Element Description app engine apis Optional.
- For more information about the possible MIME media types, see the IANA MIME Media Types website . redirect http response code Optional. redirect http response code is used with the secure setting to set the HTTP response code returned when performing a redirect required by how the secure setting is configured. redirect http response code element has the following possible values: 301 Moved Permanently response code.
- A high maximum means users might wait longer for their requests to be served (if there are pending requests and no idle instances to serve them), but your application will cost less to run. min pending latency An optional element you can set to specify the minimum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting a new instance to handle it.

Evidence snippets:
- Google Workspace domain-wide delegation of authority If you have a Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) domain, an administrator of the domain can authorize an application to access user data on behalf of users in the Google Workspace domain.
- For example, if you want to pull a user's data from Google Drive and bring it into your app, use OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications to share specific data while keeping other data, such as usernames and passwords, private.
- Authorizing a service account to access data on behalf of users in a domain is sometimes referred to as "delegating domain-wide authority" to a service account.
- If you don't specify credentials when constructing // the client, the client library will look for credentials in the // environment. const storage = new Storage (); // Makes an authenticated API request. async function listBuckets () { try { const results = await storage . getBuckets (); const [ buckets ] = results ; console . log ( 'Buckets:' ); buckets . forEach ( bucket = > { console . log ( bucket . name ); }); } catch ( err ) { console . error ( 'ERROR:' , err ); } } listBuckets (); PHP // Imports the Cloud Storage client library. use Google\Cloud\Storage\StorageClient; / Authenticate to a cloud client library using a service account implicitly. @param string $projectId The Google project ID. / function auth cloud implicit($projectId) { $config = [ 'projectId' => $projectId, ]; If you don't specify credentials when constructing the client, the client library will look for credentials in the environment. $storage = new StorageClient($config); Make an authenticated API request (listing storage buckets) foreach ($storage->buckets() as $bucket) { printf('Bucket: %s' .
