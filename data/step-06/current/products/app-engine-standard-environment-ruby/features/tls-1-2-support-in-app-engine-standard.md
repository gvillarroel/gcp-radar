- For example: To update the default service of an App Engine app to accept traffic only from Cloud Load Balancing and VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update default --ingress = internal-and-cloud-load-balancing To update a service named "internal-requests" to accept traffic only from VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update internal-requests --ingress = internal-only Egress settings Note: Egress settings are not available for the PHP runtimes.
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
- For requests from other App Engine services or from Cloud Run or Cloud Run functions in the same project, connect the service or function to a VPC network and route all egress through the connector, as described in Connecting to a Shared VPC network .

- Examples: Use the following examples to help you create your firewall: Add a rule that allows an IPv6 address and subnet mask, and then test that rule to ensure it gets evaluated prior to your other rules: gcloud app firewall-rules create 123 --source-range fe80::3636:3bff:fecc:8778/128 --action allow gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip fe80::3636:3bff:fecc:8778 Add a rule to deny an IPv4 address and subnet mask, and then test that rule to ensure that it gets appropriately evaluated: gcloud app firewall-rules create 123456 --source-range "74.125.0.0/16" --action deny gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip 74 .125.0.8 Update and then test the default rule to ensure that it restricts all IP addresses that don't match any other rules: gcloud app firewall-rules update default --action deny gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip 123 .456.7.89 API To programmatically create firewall rules for your App Engine app, you can use the apps.firewall.ingressRules methods in the Admin API.
- Before you begin Before you can create App Engine firewall rules for your app, you must have one of the following App Engine IAM roles , which include the necessary privileges for creating or modifying firewall rules: App Engine Admin Editor Owner Creating firewall rules Use one of the following methods to create a firewall rule.
- Understanding App Engine firewall rules An App Engine firewall consists of an ordered list of rules that can allow or deny access from the specified IP address or range to your app.
