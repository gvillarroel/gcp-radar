# Users API group expansion support

Product: App Engine standard environment Ruby
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Evidence snippets:
- Google Workspace domain-wide delegation of authority If you have a Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) domain, an administrator of the domain can authorize an application to access user data on behalf of users in the Google Workspace domain.
- For example, an application that uses the Google Calendar API to add events to the calendars of all users in a Google Workspace domain would use a service account to access the Google Calendar API on behalf of users.
- Granting users access to Cloud resources If you want your app to read user data from another Google service, you'll need to set up OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications .
- Authorizing a service account to access data on behalf of users in a domain is sometimes referred to as "delegating domain-wide authority" to a service account.
