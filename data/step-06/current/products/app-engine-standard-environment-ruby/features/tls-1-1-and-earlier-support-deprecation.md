- Generally, your app.yaml file requires only the runtime element for a simple Go 1.12+ app in the standard environment, for example: runtime : go126 App Engine provides default values for all other settings, including the F1 instance class , which determines the memory and CPU resources that are available to your app, and automatic scaling , which controls how and when new instances of your app are created.
- For example, if you name your app.yaml file service-name-app.yaml or app.standard.yaml , then you must deploy your app using either: gcloud app deploy service - name - app . yaml gcloud app deploy app . standard . yaml To learn more about structuring multiple services and app.yaml files in your app, see Structuring web services .
- An App Engine app is configured using an app.yaml file, that contains the runtime, handlers, scaling, and other general settings including environment variables.
