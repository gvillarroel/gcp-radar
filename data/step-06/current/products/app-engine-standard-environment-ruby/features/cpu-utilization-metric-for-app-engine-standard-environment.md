Evidence snippets:
- However, if you create a connector in a service project and the connector targets a Shared VPC network in the host project, you must add firewall rules to allow necessary traffic for the connector's operation from the following ranges: Serverless infrastructure IP range : 35.199.224.0/19 Health check probe IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 , 35.191.192.0/18 , and 130.211.0.0/22 These ranges are used by the Google infrastructure underlying Cloud Run, Cloud Run functions, and App Engine standard environment.
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- This page shows how to use Serverless VPC Access to connect your App Engine services in the standard environment directly to your VPC network, allowing access to Compute Engine VM instances, Memorystore instances, and any other resources with an internal IP address.

- When your app is running on App Engine, the PORT environment variable is set for you, but when testing your app locally, you can set PORT to any preferred value.
- For a deeper dive into how App Engine works, see the Go Runtime Environment .
- Create a new folder called go-app for your Go service: mkdir go-app In your go-app/ folder, create a file called app.yaml , and add the following contents: runtime : go126 # or another supported version This is the simplest configuration for an App Engine app.
