Evidence snippets:
- OK Download the Hello World app Choose one of the following to download the Hello World sample app from GitHub, to your local machine: Clone the Hello World sample app from the following repository: git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-custom-runtimes-samples Download the sample as a .zip file and then extract it to a local directory.
- Navigate to the nginx directory where the sample code is located, for example: cd appengine-custom-runtimes-samples/nginx Running Hello World on your local machine You can test the sample app by downloading and installing Docker , and then running the Hello World container on your local machine.
- The app.yaml file must reside in the same directory as the Dockerfile file. runtime : custom env : flex The runtime: custom entry tells App Engine to look for a Dockerfile that will define your runtime's image and env: flex specifies that you are deploying to the flexible environment.
- Enable billing in your new Google Cloud project by creating a new billing account or setting an existing one: Go to Billing Download and install the Google Cloud CLI and then initialize the gcloud CLI: Download the SDK Run the following gcloud command to create an App Engine application and specify in which geographical region that you want your app to run: gcloud app create Due to changes in the default behavior for how Cloud Build uses service accounts in new projects, and secure-by-default organization policy changes , you might need to grant additional roles to your deploying service account.

Evidence snippets:
- By default, the generated entrypoint for a F4 instance class (memory settings are calculated from the instance class) is equivalent to the following configuration: <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <entrypoint> java -showversion -Xms32M -Xmx819M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.logging/java.util.logging=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED -Dclasspath.runtimebase=/base/java runtime -Djava.class.path=/base/java runtime/runtime-main.jar -Djava.library.path=/base/java runtime: com/google/apphosting/runtime/JavaRuntimeMainWithDefaults --fixed application path=/workspace /base/java runtime </entrypoint> </appengine-web-app> You can modify the configuration to add extra JVM process flags or define your own process to boot.
- Example <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <application>simple-app</application> <module>default</module> <version>uno</version> <instance-class>B8</instance-class> <manual-scaling> <instances>5</instances> </manual-scaling> </appengine-web-app> Staging elements Much of the work done during a deployment occurs locally in a preparation step called staging , where JAR files are assembled, JSPs are compiled, and so forth.
- To serve custom error pages, add a <static-error-handlers> section to your appengine-web.xml , as ins this example: <static-error-handlers> <handler file="default error.html" /> <handler file="over quota.html" error-code="over quota" /> </static-error-handlers> Warning : Make sure that the path to the error response file does not overlap with static file handler paths.
- If for some reason you prefer that your app not use precompilation, you can turn it off by adding the following to your appengine-web.xml file: <precompilation-enabled>false</precompilation-enabled> <module> Note: Modules are now named Services and services are still declared in appengine-web.xml files as modules, for example: <module>service name</module> .

Evidence snippets:
- Create a new folder called go-app for your Go service: mkdir go-app In your go-app/ folder, create a file called app.yaml , and add the following contents: runtime : go126 # or another supported version This is the simplest configuration for an App Engine app.
- When your app is running on App Engine, the PORT environment variable is set for you, but when testing your app locally, you can set PORT to any preferred value.
- Write a basic web service for App Engine Learn how to write a web service and declare runtime settings.
- For apps created after February 2020, REGION ID .r is included in App Engine URLs.
