- Go Java Node.js PHP Python Ruby To authenticate users in Google Cloud applications, Google offers the following user authentication methods: Authentication Service Summary Identity Platform (recommended) Authenticate users using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and any provider that supports SAML or OpenID Connect protocol.
- Similar to Identity Platform, Firebase Authentication supports multiple authentication methods (SAML, OIDC, email/password, social, mobile, and custom auth) to provide flexible integration options for any identity solution.
- Identity Platform Identity Platform is a customer identity and access management (CIAM) platform that lets organizations customize identity and authentication for user sign-up and sign-in in their applications.
