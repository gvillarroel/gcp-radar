# Task Queue push requests Content-Length header for empty payloads

Product: App Engine standard environment Ruby
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

Push Queue requests without a payload now include a Content-Length header set to 0.

## Extended Definition

Push Queue requests without a payload now include a Content-Length header set to 0.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

Evidence snippets:
- App Engine pending queue prioritization During periods of heavy traffic, App Engine might place requests in a pending queue while waiting for an available instance with the following prioritization: App Engine prioritizes other queued requests over pending queued requests from Task queue .
- All subsequent requests for this URL that contain the Accept-Encoding: gzip header will receive the gzipped data from the cache until the cache becomes invalidated (due to the content changing after the cache expires).
- Requests from App Engine Cloud Tasks also share this pending queue priority behavior for compatibility reasons.
- The following response headers that you can set in app.yaml influence how and when the Google Front End caches content: Cache-Control should be set to public for the Google Front End to cache content; it may also be cached by the Google Front End unless you specify a Cache-Control private or no-store directive.

Evidence snippets:
- It's possible to reduce request latency by configuring your application to asynchronously write HTTP session data to the Datastore: <async-session-persistence enabled="true" /> With async session persistence turned on, App Engine will submit a Task Queue task to write session data to the Datastore before writing the data to memcache.
- However, you won't be charged for more instances than the maximum number you've specified. <max-pending-latency> The maximum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting additional instances to handle requests so that pending latency is reduced.
- If your application interacts with Datastore or Task Queues operations, set up monitoring to monitor performance and behavior impacts after enabling this feature. <system-properties> <property name="appengine.use.httpconnector" value="true"/> </system-properties> Optional.
- The following example demonstrates how to designate all png files as static files (except those in the data/ directory and all of its subdirectories): < static - files > < include path = "/ .png" / > < exclude path = "/data/ .png" / > < / static - files > You can also set HTTP headers to use when responding to requests to these static resources. < static - files > < include path = "/my static-files" > < http - header name = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value = "http://example.org" / > < / include > < / static - files > Note: If the path string doesn't start with a slash, then the HTTP headers, if any, work on App Engine but do not work on the Development Server.

- However, this is bound by the following restrictions: App Engine reserves automatic scaling capacity for applications with low latency, where the application responds to requests in less than one second.
- For example: Strict-Transport-Security : max-age = 31536000 ; includeSubDomains To set this header for responses that are generated from your code, use the flask-talisman library .
