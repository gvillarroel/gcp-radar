Evidence snippets:
- Route the traffic over a Serverless VPC Access connector : For each App Engine version sending private traffic to other app endpoints, attach the version to a Serverless VPC Access connector belonging to one of the Google Cloud project's own networks, not a Shared VPC network.
- Configure the client app to send all-traffic through the Serverless VPC Access connector, instead of configuring requests to use the private.googleapis.com IP range.
- In the standard environment, attach each client version to a Serverless VPC Access connector on the Shared VPC network.
- Ensure Private Google Access is enabled for the subnet used by the Serverless VPC Access connector.

Evidence snippets:
- You can then create and modify your firewall rules to control the scope of access throughout your release process, allowing only certain organizations, either within your company or externally, to access your app as it makes its way to public availability.
- App Engine firewall The App Engine firewall enables you to control access to your App Engine app through a set of rules that can either allow or deny requests from the specified ranges of IP addresses.
- Create a firewall to: Allow only traffic from within a specific network Ensure that only a certain range of IP addresses from specific networks can access your app.
- Access control In each Google Cloud project, set up access control to determine who can access the services within the project, including App Engine.
