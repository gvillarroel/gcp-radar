- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 133
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Cloud Network Insights is an out-of-the-box solution offered in partnership with AppNeta by Broadcom that provides visibility into network health and application performance across complex, multicloud, and hybrid environments.
- Since you control both ends, this mode provides richer data, including precise one-way latency, jitter, and the ability to detect asymmetric routing such as different paths for uploading versus downloading.
- The source of the degradation could be in Google Cloud, third party cloud service providers, last-mile connectivity to on-premises, or the internet.
- This is used to identify exactly where in the network (such as a specific ISP router or a hybrid gateway) a problem is occurring.
