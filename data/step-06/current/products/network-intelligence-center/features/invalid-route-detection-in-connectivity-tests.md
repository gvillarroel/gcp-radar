Evidence snippets:
- You can query these logs in the Logs Explorer to perform root-cause analysis or create log-based alerts for immediate notification. networkmanagement.googleapis.com/insights alarm : Triggered when performance deviates from your defined baselines. networkmanagement.googleapis.com/insights event : Triggered by structural changes, such as when a Monitoring Point goes offline and online again, or a network route change (path change).
- Cloud Network Insights uses active synthetic probing to monitor these complex paths from the perspective of the user or the application, allowing you to monitor network routes even when no user traffic is present.
- Features and benefits Cloud Network Insights provides the following benefits: Proactive detection : Identify network and application performance issues with synthetic testing, often before they impact users.
- These paths operate in two modes: Single-ended paths : The Monitoring Point probes an external target (for example, google.com , a SaaS VIP, or a router) that does not have a Monitoring Point installed.
