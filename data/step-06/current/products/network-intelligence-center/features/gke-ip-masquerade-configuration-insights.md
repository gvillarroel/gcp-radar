Evidence snippets:
- Shared VPC insights For Shared VPC cases, there are two scenarios: Host project: Network Analyzer provides relevant information for VPC networks in the host project, such as IP address utilization insights that display the IP address allocation percentage of subnets.
- Analysis schedule Network Analyzer generates insights whenever relevant configuration changes are made, as well as periodically.
- Network Analyzer automatically monitors your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network configurations and detects misconfigurations and suboptimal configurations.
- It provides insights about network topology, firewall rules, routes, configuration dependencies, and connectivity to services and applications.

Evidence snippets:
- In the Infrastructure view, the insights for metrics for the selected hour on the timeline include the following: High egress instances: aggregated hourly values for various types of egress High egress instance groups: aggregated hourly values for various types of egress In the GKE Enterprise view available for GKE Enterprise projects, the insights for metrics for the selected hour on the timeline include the following: High egress GKE workloads: aggregated hourly values for various types of egress for GKE workloads, in the GKE Enterprise view Filter the traffic based on the traffic types You can further filter the traffic based on the following traffic types: All egress traffic for an entity Cross-zonal egress traffic: useful for analyzing billable traffic Egress to internet: used for analyzing billable traffic and for analyzing the traffic that reaches external endpoints Hybrid egress: used to analyze the volume of traffic to on-premises, including Cloud Interconnect, Cloud VPN, and Router appliance connections In the GKE Enterprise view, you can further filter the traffic based on the following traffic types: All measured egress traffic from the selected entity Cross-zonal egress traffic: useful for analyzing billable traffic between Google Cloud zones Multiple projects Network Topology visualizes resources in your project, or you can use Cloud Monitoring, which can visualize metrics for multiple Google Cloud projects.
- Metrics for the selected hour on the timeline include the following: Average hourly throughput available for most entities Average hourly packet loss available for traffic within Google Cloud regions and zones Hourly median latency (RTT) available for many entity types In the GKE Enterprise view available for GKE Enterprise projects, the metrics for the selected hour on the timeline also include the following: Average hourly throughput available for most entities Median latency available for traffic within Google Cloud regions and zones with GKE clusters Network verdict metrics displaying the GKE workloads with the most dropped and most forwarded traffic flows for the selected cluster You can also download the table of outliers in a CSV format for the High egress and Network verdict traffic insights.
