- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 142
- Re-rank relevance: WEAK
- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- Operations in the API can be performed by calling methods attached to objects, calling algorithms, calling Code Editor specific functions, or defining new functions.
- Notation used in the guides: Static methods called on an Earth Engine class (for example ee.Image ) are written as Image.staticMethod() .
- Earth Engine algorithms There are several ways to run operations in the API: Calling methods that are attached to objects.
- Various methods exist for this purpose in the API.

Evidence snippets:
- ImageCollection ( 'MODIS/006/MOD44B' ); // Error: User-defined methods must return a value. var badMap1 = collection . map ( function ( image ) { // Do nothing. }); Python setup See the Python Environment page for information on the Python API and using geemap for interactive development. import ee import geemap.core as geemap Colab (Python) collection = ee .
- Debugging methods include inspecting variables and map layers, using aside() to print intermediate values in a chain of calls, running functions on individual elements (especially for mapped functions), and utilizing the profiler to identify resource-intensive operations.
- Point ([ 106.91 , 47.91 ])) . map ( function ( image ) { return image . addBands ( image . normalizedDifference ([ 'B5' , 'B4' ])); }) . aside ( Map . addLayer , { bands : [ 'B4' , 'B3' , 'B2' ], max : 0.3 }, 'collection' ) . qualityMosaic ( 'nd' ); Map . setCenter ( 106.91 , 47.91 , 11 ); Map . addLayer ( composite , { bands : [ 'B4' , 'B3' , 'B2' ], max : 0.3 }, 'composite' ); Python setup See the Python Environment page for information on the Python API and using geemap for interactive development. import ee import geemap.core as geemap Colab (Python) m = geemap .
