Evidence snippets:
- Notice the cost sidebar on the right when you choose the instance type, which displays bandwidth and cost estimations.
- Test the custom constraint To test the example that restricts ingress settings, deploy a connector in the project with network set to default : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create org-policy-test \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION ID \ --network = default The output is the following: Operation denied by custom org policies: ["customConstraints/custom.defaultNetworkConstraint": "Require network to not be set to default."] Example custom organization policies for common use cases The following table provides examples of custom constraints that you might find useful with Serverless VPC Access connectors: Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors can only use a specific network. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.allowlistNetworks resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.network == 'allowlisted-network'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : allowlistNetworks description : Require connectors to use a specific network.
- When you have entered a value into each field, the equivalent YAML configuration for this custom constraint appears on the right. gcloud To create a custom constraint, create a YAML file using the following format: name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/ CONSTRAINT NAME resourceTypes : RESOURCE NAME methodTypes : - CREATE condition : " CONDITION " actionType : ACTION displayName : DISPLAY NAME description : DESCRIPTION Replace the following: ORGANIZATION ID : your organization ID, such as 123456789 .
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
