- The following table compares GitHub legacy triggers, GitHub triggers, and GitHub Enterprise triggers: Feature GitHub legacy triggers GitHub triggers GitHub Enterprise triggers Execute builds on pushes to the source code Yes Yes Yes Execute builds on pull requests No Yes Yes Create trigger using Google Cloud console Yes Yes Yes Create trigger using the Cloud Build API No Yes Yes Create trigger using the Cloud Build GitHub app No Yes Yes View build status on Google Cloud console Yes Yes Yes View build status on GitHub No Yes Yes Data sharing The data sent to GitHub from Cloud Build helps you identify triggers by name and see build results on GitHub.
- To create GitHub triggers using gcloud commands, see the gcloud commands for Creating a build trigger . gcloud CLI To create GitHub triggers using gcloud commands, run the following command: gcloud alpha builds triggers create developer - connect -- name = TRIGGER NAME \ -- git - repository - link = projects / PROJECT ID / locations / REGION / connections / CONNECTION NAME / gitRepositoryLinks / REPO NAME \ -- branch - pattern = BRANCH PATTERN # or -- tag - pattern = TAG PATTERN \ -- build - config = BUILD CONFIG FILE \ -- region = REGION \ -- service - account = SERVICE - ACCOUNT Where: TRIGGER NAME is the name of your trigger.
- GitHub legacy triggers : When you create a GitHub legacy trigger, Cloud Build mirrors your GitHub repository in Cloud Source Repositories and uses the mirrored repository for all its operations.
- Build and view your changes To build using GitHub triggers , you'll need to push and commit changes to your connected source repository or configure your build on pull requests.

- Terraform For sample Terraform code about creating a build trigger and connecting it to your GitHub Enterprise installation using Developer Connect, see the following topics in the Terraform documentation: Create a Developer Connect push trigger Create a Developer Connect pull trigger Data sharing The data sent to GitHub Enterprise from Cloud Build helps you identify triggers by name and see build results on GitHub Enterprise.
- If you want to use GitHub Enterprise triggers in a private network, see Building repositories from GitHub Enterprise in a private network for further instructions.
- Google Cloud console To create GitHub Enterprise triggers using the Google Cloud console, do the following: Open the Triggers page in the Google Cloud console.

Evidence snippets:
- To create a trigger if your source code is in GitHub : gcloud builds triggers create github \ -- name = TRIGGER NAME \ -- region = REGION \ -- repo - name = REPO NAME \ -- repo - owner = REPO OWNER \ -- branch - pattern = BRANCH PATTERN \ # or -- tag - pattern = TAG PATTERN -- build - config = BUILD CONFIG FILE \ -- service - account = SERVICE ACCOUNT \ -- require - approval -- include - logs - with - status Where: REGION is the region for your trigger.
- See the gcloud instructions for how to update a build trigger to show or hide build logs for GitHub or GitHub Enterprise triggers. gcloud To update a trigger: Export the trigger you would like to update: gcloud beta builds triggers export TRIGGER NAME -- destination = EXPORT PATH Where: TRIGGER NAME is the name of your trigger.
- If you're using GitHub pull request triggers, any user with read access to the repository can submit a pull request, which may execute a build that includes changes to the code in the pull request.
- This page explains how to connect to source repositories such as GitHub and Bitbucket, and create build triggers to build the code in the repositories.
