Evidence snippets:
- Click Create to save your build trigger. gcloud To create a trigger if your source code is in Cloud Source Repositories : gcloud builds triggers create cloud-source-repositories \ --repo= REPO NAME \ --branch-pattern= BRANCH PATTERN \ # or --tag-pattern= TAG PATTERN --build-config= BUILD CONFIG FILE \ --service-account= SERVICE ACCOUNT \ --require-approval Where: REPO NAME is the name of your repository.
- This page explains how to connect to source repositories such as GitHub and Bitbucket, and create build triggers to build the code in the repositories.
- You can directly create triggers for your repositories in Cloud Source Repositories without manually connecting to them.
- You can only connect repositories from GitHub and GitHub Enterprise when selecting 2nd generation as your source.

### "Automate builds in response to Pub/Sub events \_|\_ Cloud Build \_|\_ Google\

- Source ID: `site-docs-root-2`
- Final score: 104
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- To clone and build repositories through your external source code management system, see Creating and managing build triggers to learn how to specify a build configuration inline.
- Note: Pub/Sub triggers cannot build GitHub Enterprise, Bitbucket Data Center, and Bitbucket Server repositories through Cloud Build's native integration.
- In the example below, the trigger is configured to respond to builds with a Cloud Storage event associated with a new binary pushed to an existing storage bucket: gcloud builds triggers create pubsub \ -- name = TRIGGER NAME \ -- topic = projects / PROJECT ID / topics / TOPIC NAME \ -- build - config = BUILD CONFIG \ # or -- inline - config = INLINE BUILD CONFIG -- substitutions = \ ' EVENT TYPE = "$(body.message.attributes.eventType)" , ' \ ' BUCKET ID = "$(body.message.attributes.bucketId)" , ' \ ' OBJECT ID = "$(body.message.attributes.objectId)" ' \ -- subscription - filter = ' EVENT TYPE == "OBJECT FINALIZE" && OBJECT ID . matches ( "<object-id>" ) && BUCKET ID . matches ( "<bucket-id>" ) ' \ -- repo = REPO NAME \ -- repo - type = REPO TYPE \ -- tag = TAG NAME # or -- branch = BRANCH NAME Where: TRIGGER NAME is the name of your trigger.
- In the example below, the trigger is configured to respond to builds with a tag matching prod and an action matching INSERT based on the specified payload as defined by the substitution variable, IMAGE TAG . gcloud builds triggers create pubsub \ -- name = TRIGGER NAME \ -- topic = projects / PROJECT ID / topics / TOPIC NAME \ -- build - config = BUILD CONFIG \ # or -- inline - config = INLINE BUILD CONFIG -- substitutions = \ ' IMAGE TAG = "$(body.message.data.tag)" , ' \ ' ACTION = "$(body.message.data.action)" ' \ -- subscription - filter = ' IMAGE TAG != "" && ACTION == "INSERT" ' \ -- repo = REPO NAME \ -- repo - type = REPO TYPE \ -- tag = TAG NAME # or -- branch = BRANCH NAME Where: TRIGGER NAME is the name of your trigger.
