Evidence snippets:
- To create a trigger if your source code is in GitHub : gcloud builds triggers create github \ -- name = TRIGGER NAME \ -- region = REGION \ -- repo - name = REPO NAME \ -- repo - owner = REPO OWNER \ -- branch - pattern = BRANCH PATTERN \ # or -- tag - pattern = TAG PATTERN -- build - config = BUILD CONFIG FILE \ -- service - account = SERVICE ACCOUNT \ -- require - approval -- include - logs - with - status Where: REGION is the region for your trigger.
- Click Create to save your build trigger. gcloud To create a trigger if your source code is in Cloud Source Repositories : gcloud builds triggers create cloud-source-repositories \ --repo= REPO NAME \ --branch-pattern= BRANCH PATTERN \ # or --tag-pattern= TAG PATTERN --build-config= BUILD CONFIG FILE \ --service-account= SERVICE ACCOUNT \ --require-approval Where: REPO NAME is the name of your repository.
- See the gcloud instructions for how to update a build trigger to show or hide build logs for GitHub or GitHub Enterprise triggers. gcloud To update a trigger: Export the trigger you would like to update: gcloud beta builds triggers export TRIGGER NAME -- destination = EXPORT PATH Where: TRIGGER NAME is the name of your trigger.
- Before you begin To ensure that has the necessary permissions to create and manage build triggers, ask your administrator to grant the Cloud Build Editor ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor ) IAM role to on the account for your project.

- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- In the example below, the trigger is configured to respond to builds with a tag matching prod and an action matching INSERT based on the specified payload as defined by the substitution variable, IMAGE TAG . gcloud builds triggers create pubsub \ -- name = TRIGGER NAME \ -- topic = projects / PROJECT ID / topics / TOPIC NAME \ -- build - config = BUILD CONFIG \ # or -- inline - config = INLINE BUILD CONFIG -- substitutions = \ ' IMAGE TAG = "$(body.message.data.tag)" , ' \ ' ACTION = "$(body.message.data.action)" ' \ -- subscription - filter = ' IMAGE TAG != "" && ACTION == "INSERT" ' \ -- repo = REPO NAME \ -- repo - type = REPO TYPE \ -- tag = TAG NAME # or -- branch = BRANCH NAME Where: TRIGGER NAME is the name of your trigger.
- In the example below, the trigger is configured to respond to builds with a Cloud Storage event associated with a new binary pushed to an existing storage bucket: gcloud builds triggers create pubsub \ -- name = TRIGGER NAME \ -- topic = projects / PROJECT ID / topics / TOPIC NAME \ -- build - config = BUILD CONFIG \ # or -- inline - config = INLINE BUILD CONFIG -- substitutions = \ ' EVENT TYPE = "$(body.message.attributes.eventType)" , ' \ ' BUCKET ID = "$(body.message.attributes.bucketId)" , ' \ ' OBJECT ID = "$(body.message.attributes.objectId)" ' \ -- subscription - filter = ' EVENT TYPE == "OBJECT FINALIZE" && OBJECT ID . matches ( "<object-id>" ) && BUCKET ID . matches ( "<bucket-id>" ) ' \ -- repo = REPO NAME \ -- repo - type = REPO TYPE \ -- tag = TAG NAME # or -- branch = BRANCH NAME Where: TRIGGER NAME is the name of your trigger.
