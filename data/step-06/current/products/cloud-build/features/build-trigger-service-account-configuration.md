Evidence snippets:
- Security implications of build triggers The service account configured for a build trigger can provide elevated build-time permissions to users who employ triggers to invoke a build.
- To create a trigger if your source code is in GitHub : gcloud builds triggers create github \ -- name = TRIGGER NAME \ -- region = REGION \ -- repo - name = REPO NAME \ -- repo - owner = REPO OWNER \ -- branch - pattern = BRANCH PATTERN \ # or -- tag - pattern = TAG PATTERN -- build - config = BUILD CONFIG FILE \ -- service - account = SERVICE ACCOUNT \ -- require - approval -- include - logs - with - status Where: REGION is the region for your trigger.
- Click Create to save your build trigger. gcloud To create a trigger if your source code is in Cloud Source Repositories : gcloud builds triggers create cloud-source-repositories \ --repo= REPO NAME \ --branch-pattern= BRANCH PATTERN \ # or --tag-pattern= TAG PATTERN --build-config= BUILD CONFIG FILE \ --service-account= SERVICE ACCOUNT \ --require-approval Where: REPO NAME is the name of your repository.
- Before you begin To ensure that has the necessary permissions to create and manage build triggers, ask your administrator to grant the Cloud Build Editor ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor ) IAM role to on the account for your project.

- Final score: 140
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Use the following command to invoke a webhook event: curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" "https://cloudbuild.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ ${ PROJECT ID } /locations/ ${ REGION } /triggers/ ${ TRIGGER NAME } :webhook?key= ${ API KEY } & secret= ${ SECRET VALUE } & trigger= ${ TRIGGER NAME } & projectId= ${ PROJECT ID } " -d "{}" After completing these steps, the Secret Manager Secret Accessor role will automatically be granted to your Cloud Build service agent, service-${PROJECT NUMBER}@gcp-sa-cloudbuild.iam.gserviceaccount.com .
- Repository triggers that use Cloud Build repositories (2nd gen) can be configured programmatically and are natively integrated with source providers, including support for GitHub and GitLab.
- Repository triggers let you filter incoming events and post build status back to the source provider, and can also be configured to work with a private network.
- With webhook triggers, you can define an inline build configuration file rather than specify a source when creating your trigger.

Evidence snippets:
- In the example below, the trigger is configured to respond to builds with a Cloud Storage event associated with a new binary pushed to an existing storage bucket: gcloud builds triggers create pubsub \ -- name = TRIGGER NAME \ -- topic = projects / PROJECT ID / topics / TOPIC NAME \ -- build - config = BUILD CONFIG \ # or -- inline - config = INLINE BUILD CONFIG -- substitutions = \ ' EVENT TYPE = "$(body.message.attributes.eventType)" , ' \ ' BUCKET ID = "$(body.message.attributes.bucketId)" , ' \ ' OBJECT ID = "$(body.message.attributes.objectId)" ' \ -- subscription - filter = ' EVENT TYPE == "OBJECT FINALIZE" && OBJECT ID . matches ( "<object-id>" ) && BUCKET ID . matches ( "<bucket-id>" ) ' \ -- repo = REPO NAME \ -- repo - type = REPO TYPE \ -- tag = TAG NAME # or -- branch = BRANCH NAME Where: TRIGGER NAME is the name of your trigger.
- In the example below, the trigger is configured to respond to builds with a tag matching prod and an action matching INSERT based on the specified payload as defined by the substitution variable, IMAGE TAG . gcloud builds triggers create pubsub \ -- name = TRIGGER NAME \ -- topic = projects / PROJECT ID / topics / TOPIC NAME \ -- build - config = BUILD CONFIG \ # or -- inline - config = INLINE BUILD CONFIG -- substitutions = \ ' IMAGE TAG = "$(body.message.data.tag)" , ' \ ' ACTION = "$(body.message.data.action)" ' \ -- subscription - filter = ' IMAGE TAG != "" && ACTION == "INSERT" ' \ -- repo = REPO NAME \ -- repo - type = REPO TYPE \ -- tag = TAG NAME # or -- branch = BRANCH NAME Where: TRIGGER NAME is the name of your trigger.
