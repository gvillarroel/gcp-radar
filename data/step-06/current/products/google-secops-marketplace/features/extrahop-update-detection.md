- You can ask Gemini questions about MITRE tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and receive contextually relevant answers that include the following MITRE details: Tactic Technique Sub-technique Detection suggestions Procedures Mitigations Gemini returns a link to the curated detections Google SecOps makes available for each TTP.
- Answer Threat Intelligence questions with Gemini Supported in: Google secops SIEM Gemini can answer questions related to threat intelligence about topics such as threat actors, their associations, and their behavior patterns, including questions about MITRE TTPs .
- Specifically, threat intelligence data is more limited in product editions other than Enterprise Plus because they don't include full access to Mandiant and VirusTotal.

- When to use composite detections Composite detections can be useful for achieving the following goals: Correlate outcomes of two or more rules (for example, linking a Malware Downloaded detection with a subsequent C2 Beaconing alert from the same host).
- Then, use a composite rule with a long match window (for example, 24 hours) to trigger on an initial suspicious login and correlate it with any of the following detections from the same user: A user clearing their command-line history.

Evidence snippets:
- Release notes The general structure for the release note should follow the following format: {integration item} - {update} For example: Get Case Details - Added ability to fetch information about affected IOCs Depending on the situation, there are unique release notes for specific scenarios: If it's a new integration: New Integration Added - {integration name} If a new action is added: New Action Added - {action name} If a new connector is added: New Connector Added - {connector name} If a new job is added: New Job Added - {job name} If a predefined widget is added to an action: {action name} - Added Predefined Widget.
- For changes that affect all integration items: Integration - {Update} For changes that affect all actions: Integration's Actions - {Update} For changes that affect all connectors: Integration's Connectors - {Update} For changes that affect all jobs: Integration's Jobs - {Update} If the release contained a regressive change, then in the release note you need to specify REGRESSIVE! .
- For example, the following JSON object represents a poor structure as it would be unusable inside playbooks: { "10.10.10.10": { "is malicious": "false" } } Instead, format it like this: [ { "is malicious": "false", "ip": "10.10.10.10" } ] If you're using entities inside the action and return results Per Entity, then the best practice is to structure the JSON Result like this: [ { "Entity": "10.10.10.10", "EntityResult": { "is malicious": "false", } } ] Always consider how the output of the action can be used inside automation.

- Curated detection rule sets The Curated Prioritization category includes the following rule sets that support the Applied Threat Intelligence feature in Google SecOps: Active Breach Priority Network Indicators : Detects network-related Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) in event data using Mandiant Threat Intelligence and prioritizes IoCs with the 'Active breach' label.
- These fields, combined with prioritization features from Mandiant Threat Intelligence, help determine priority levels, such as Active breach, High, or Medium: network.direction security result.[]action event count (active breach IP address only) For IP address indicators, the network.direction is required.
- Applied Threat Intelligence curated detections overview Supported in: Google secops SIEM This document provides an overview of the Curated Detection rule sets within the Applied Threat Intelligence Curated Prioritization category, available in Google Security Operations Enterprise Plus.
