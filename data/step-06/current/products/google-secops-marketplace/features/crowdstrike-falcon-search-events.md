Evidence snippets:
- For example, for CrowdStrike Falcon, you can create multiple unique feeds under both required and optional log types to make sure there's enough comprehensive data coverage.
- Send multiple events in a single webhook request The following code sample shows how to format a single request body with multiple, newline-separated JSON objects after the curl --location item: --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --header 'X-goog-api-key: API KEY' \ --header 'X-Webhook-Access-Key: SECRET' \ --data '{"principal": {"asset id": "asset 123"}, "metadata": {"event type": "GENERIC EVENT", "product name": "Product Acme"}} {"principal": {"asset id": "asset 123"}, "metadata": {"event type": "GENERIC EVENT", "product name": "Product Acme"}}' Create an HTTPS webhook feed In the Google SecOps menu, select Settings , and then click Feeds .
- The Feeds page provides several tools to help you navigate and organize your list of configured feeds: Search: Use the search bar to find a feed by its Feed Name , Feed ID , or Source type .
- Required actions for customers To ensure continuous data ingestion, you must manually re-create your feeds in the new environment.

Evidence snippets:
- CrowdStrike Detections API deprecation in SOAR integration The CrowdStrike Falcon SOAR integration used the Detections API within its actions and connectors.
- CrowdStrike's deprecation of this API affects the following actions and connectors: Add Comment to Detection Close Detection Update Detection CrowdStrike - Detections Connector The SOAR CrowdStrike integration already supports the Alerts API, which replaces the Detections API.
- Option 1: Update permissions for your existing CrowdStrike API client (Recommended) Option 2: Create and use a new CrowdStrike API client Option 1: Update permissions for your existing CrowdStrike API client (Recommended) This approach requires configuration changes only in your CrowdStrike Falcon console and has the lowest impact on existing detection rules that reference the CS DETECTS log type.
- To set up and use the dashboard, perform the following steps: Navigate to the CrowdStrike support article and download the YAML file, titled, PlannedDecommissionofthedetectsAPI(September30,2025) , attached at the bottom of the page.
