- May 26, 2025 Feature (Cloud Composer 3) New metrics that show the number of active Airflow components are now available for Cloud Composer 3 environments: The number of active schedulers The number of active DAG processors The number of active triggerers The number of active web servers Fixed (Cloud Composer 3) It's now possible to override the default scopes of access tokens in all regions supported by Cloud Composer 3.
- It comes with a number of new features and characteristics: All infrastructure hidden in a tenant project Evergreen versioning Simplified networking configuration Improved performance More reliable DAG parsing and scheduling as DAG Processor and Schedulers are now separate components 10 times bigger storage for Airflow workers As well as most functionalities already known from the previous Composer versions.

Evidence snippets:
- Airflow 1.9.0 stores and expects the log names to be in the following format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06/1.log Airflow 1.10.x stores and expects the log names to be in the following format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log As a result, if you upgrade from Airflow 1.9.0 to Airflow 1.10.x and would like to read the log for a task executed with Airflow 1.9.0, the Airflow Web server will show the following error message: Unable to read remote log from BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log Workaround: Rename the logs generated by Airflow 1.9.0 in the Cloud Storage bucket using the format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log Cannot create Cloud Composer environments with the organization policy constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging enforced Cloud Composer environment creation fails if the constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging organization policy is enforced on the target project.
- The command-line interface is the recommended approach for deleting the connection: gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ connections delete -- \ CONNECTION ID After deleting the connection, recreate it using the Airflow UI , ensuring that the fields you intend to leave empty are indeed left blank.
- Environment is in the ERROR state after the project's billing account was deleted or deactivated, or the Cloud Composer API was disabled Cloud Composer environments affected by these problems are non-recoverable: After the project's billing account was deleted or deactivated, even if another account was linked later.
- Cloud Composer 1 environment creation fails when the compute.vmCanIpForward policy is disabled Cloud Composer 1 environments created in the non-VPC-Native (using alias IP) mode require this policy to allow the creation of VMs with the enabled IP Forwarding feature.
