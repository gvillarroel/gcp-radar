- Example: gcloud composer environments snapshots save \ example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ --snapshot-location "gs://example-bucket/environment snapshots" Example result: Response: '@type': type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.orchestration.airflow.service.v1.SaveSnapshotResponse snapshotPath: gs://example-bucket/environment snapshots/example-environment us-central1 2026-03-17T11-26-24 Prepare the destination database If you don't have a Cloud SQL instance, create one.
- You can use this approach in all versions of Airflow supported by Cloud Composer 3, including Airflow 3 versions later than 3.1.7 where direct access to the Airflow database is no longer possible.
