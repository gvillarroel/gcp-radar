- About privately used public IP ranges in Cloud Composer Google Kubernetes Engine requires many IP addresses for its resources: each node, pod, and service must have a unique IP address.
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example environment" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { node config { // Specify your network and subnetwork network = google compute network.example network.id subnetwork = google compute subnetwork.example subnet.id ip allocation policy = [{ use ip aliases = true cluster ipv4 cidr block = null services ipv4 cidr block = null // Specify existing ranges cluster secondary range name = "public-1" services secondary range name = "public-2" }] } private environment config { enable privately used public ips = true // Other private environment parameters } } } What's next Configuring Private IP environments Creating environments About Private IP environments Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- This prevents all internet access to the control plane. --enable-master-authorized-networks and --master-authorized-networks arguments configure authorized networks for your environment. --enable-privately-used-public-ips configures privately used public IP addresses for your environment. --enable-ip-masq-agent enables the IP Masquerade agent .
- Additional networking options for environments are: Privately used public IP addresses .
- If you want to use more IP addresses, your environment can privately use certain public IP address ranges as internal, subnet IP address ranges for pods and services.
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { node config { node count = 4 disk size gb = 100 zone = "us-central1-a" machine type = "n1-standard-2" service account = " example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com " } software config { scheduler count = 2 } database config { machine type = "db-n1-standard-2" } web server config { machine type = "composer-n1-webserver-2" } } } Step 4. (Optional) Configure your environment's networking Networking parameters depend on the type of environment that you want to create: Public IP environment .

Evidence snippets:
- As an option, you can also use privately used public IP addresses and the IP Masquerade agent to save the IP address space and to use non-RFC 1918 addresses.
- To get IP ranges for a subnetwork, go to VPC Networks page and click on the network's name to see details: Go to VPC Networks VPC-native cluster configuration Cloud Composer supports VPC-native GKE clusters in your environment.
- For Private IP environments, Cloud Composer assigns only private IP ( RFC 1918 ) addresses to the managed Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud SQL VMs in your environment.

### Known issues \_|\_ Cloud Composer \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 202
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Cloud Composer-owned GKE clusters configured in the Public IP mode require external connectivity for their VMs.
- If you use Private Google Access and send traffic over private.googleapis.com Virtual IPs, or VPC Service Controls and send traffic over restricted.googleapis.com Virtual IPs, make sure that your Cloud DNS is configured also for .composer.cloud.google.com domain names.
- Cloud Composer 1 environment creation fails when the compute.vmCanIpForward policy is disabled Cloud Composer 1 environments created in the non-VPC-Native (using alias IP) mode require this policy to allow the creation of VMs with the enabled IP Forwarding feature.
- If you use an earlier version of Cloud Composer than 2.4.2 and suspect that your environment might be vulnerable to the exploit, please read the following description and possible solutions.
