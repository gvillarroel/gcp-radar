Evidence snippets:
- In the host project: Edit permissions for the Composer Service Agent account, service- SERVICE PROJECT NUMBER @cloudcomposer-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com ) For this account, add another role on the project level: For Private IP environments, add the Composer Shared VPC Agent role.
- Service and host projects for Cloud Composer Shared VPC requires that you designate a host project to which networks and subnetworks belong and a service project , which is attached to the host project.
- To set up Shared VPC, select the following IP ranges in the host project: Primary IP Range of the subnet used by GKE nodes that Cloud Composer uses as its Compute Engine layer.
- Cloud Composer 3 Cloud Composer 2 Cloud Composer 1 This page describes the Shared VPC network and host project requirements for Cloud Composer.

Evidence snippets:
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { software config { image version = "composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15" } node config { service account = " example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Step 3. (Optional) Configure environment scale and performance parameters To specify the scale and performance configuration for your environment, provide the number of nodes in your environment's GKE cluster and select machine types for environment components.
- Example: // POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ /locations/ }/environments { "name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" , "config" : { "maintenanceWindow" : { "startTime" : "2023-01-01T01:00:00Z" , "endTime" : "2023-01-01T07:00:00Z" , "recurrence" : "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,WE,SA" }, "nodeConfig" : { "serviceAccount" : " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Terraform The maintenance window block specifies the maintenance windows for your environment: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = " ENVIRONMENT NAME " region = " LOCATION " config { maintenance window { start time = " DATETIME START " end time = " DATETIME END " recurrence = " MAINTENANCE RECURRENCE " } node config { service account = " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Replace: DATETIME START with the start date and time in the date/time input format .
- Example: // POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ /locations/ }/environments { "name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" , "config" : { "softwareConfig" : { "imageVersion" : "composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15" }, "nodeConfig" : { "serviceAccount" : " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Terraform To create an environment with default parameters is a specified location, add the following resource block to your Terraform configuration and run terraform apply . resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = " ENVIRONMENT NAME " region = " LOCATION " config { software config { image version = " IMAGE VERSION " } node config { service account = " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Important: You must specify an image version for Cloud Composer 1.
- Example: // POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ /locations/ }/environments { "name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" , "config" : { "nodeConfig" : { "tags" : [ "group1" , "production" ], "serviceAccount" : " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Terraform When you create an environment, following fields define network tags for your environment: tags field in the node config block specifies a comma-separated list of network tags applied to all node VMs. resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = " ENVIRONMENT NAME " region = " LOCATION " config { node config { tags = [ " TAGS " ] service account = " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Replace: TAGS with a comma-separated list of network tags.
