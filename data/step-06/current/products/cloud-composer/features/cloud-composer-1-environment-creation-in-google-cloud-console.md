Evidence snippets:
- Example: gcloud composer environments create example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ --image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \ --service-account " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " \ --env-variables SENDGRID MAIL FROM = user@example.com,SENDGRID API KEY = example-key \ --airflow-configs core-dags are paused at creation = True,webserver-dag orientation = TB API When you create an environment, in the Environment > EnvironmentConfig resource, specify environment variables and Airflow configuration overrides. { "name" : "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT NAME " , "config" : { "softwareConfig" : { "airflowConfigOverrides" : { " SECTION - KEY " : " OVERRIDE VALUE " }, "envVariables" : { " VAR NAME " : " VAR VALUE " , } }, "nodeConfig" : { "serviceAccount" : " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Replace: SECTION with the section in the configuration file where the Airflow configuration option is located.
- Example: // POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ /locations/ }/environments { "name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" , "config" : { "softwareConfig" : { "airflowConfigOverrides" : { "core-dags are paused at creation" : "True" , "webserver-dag orientation" : "TB" }, "envVariables" : { "SENDGRID MAIL FROM" : "user@example.com" , "SENDGRID API KEY" : "example-key" } }, "nodeConfig" : { "serviceAccount" : " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Terraform When you create an environment, following blocks control environment variables and Airflow configuration overrides: env variables block in the software config block specifies environment variables.
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { software config { airflow config overrides = { core-dags are paused at creation = "True" webserver-dag orientation = "TB" } env variables = { SENDGRID MAIL FROM = "user@example.com" SENDGRID API KEY = "example-key" } } node config { service account = " example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Step 8. (Optional) Specify maintenance windows By default, Cloud Composer 1 environments do not have defined maintenance windows if you create them using Google Cloud console, API, or Terraform.
