- To ensure that web server remains accessible regardless of DAG load time, you can configure asynchronous DAG loading to parse and load DAGs in the background at a pre-configured interval (available in composer-1.7.1-airflow-1.10.2 and later versions).
- The webServerNetworkAccessControl element must be present, but must not contain an allowedIpRanges element. { "config" : { "webServerNetworkAccessControl" : { "allowedIpRanges" : [ { "value" : " WS IP RANGE " , "description" : " WS RANGE DESCRIPTION " } ] } } } Replace the following: WS IP RANGE : the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access the Airflow UI.

- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- We recommend to protect access to the Airflow web server by restricting access to web server to specific IP ranges .
- In VPC Service Controls mode, Cloud Composer runs two instances of the Airflow web server.
- Configure connectivity to Google APIs and services In a VPC Service Controls configuration, to control network traffic, configure access to Google APIs and services through the restricted.googleapis.com .
- Enabling DAG serialization disables all Airflow web server plugins, as they could risk the security of the VPC network where Cloud Composer is deployed.

Evidence snippets:
- To preregister a user with a custom role through Google Cloud CLI, run the following Airflow CLI command : gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ users create -- \ -r ROLE \ -e USER EMAIL \ -u USER EMAIL \ -f FIRST NAME \ -l LAST NAME \ --use-random-password # The password value is required, but is not used Replace the following: ENVIRONMENT NAME : the name of the environment LOCATION : the region where the environment is located ROLE : an Airflow role for the user, for example, Op USER EMAIL : the user's email address FIRST NAME and LAST NAME : user's first name and last name Example: gcloud composer environments run example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ users create -- \ -r Op \ -e "example-user@example.com" \ -u "example-user@example.com" \ -f "Name" \ -l "Surname" \ --use-random-password Remove users Deleting a user from Airflow does not revoke access for that user, because they are automatically registered again next time they access the Airflow UI.

- Overview of Airflow UI access control in Cloud Composer Access to Airflow UI and DAG UI and visibility of data and operations in those UIs is controlled at two levels in Cloud Composer: Access to the Airflow UI and DAG UI in Cloud Composer is controlled by IAM .
