Evidence snippets:
- The command-line interface is the recommended approach for deleting the connection: gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ connections delete -- \ CONNECTION ID After deleting the connection, recreate it using the Airflow UI , ensuring that the fields you intend to leave empty are indeed left blank.
- You should see two deployments that are marked with the described labels: A deployment named <environment-location>-<environment-name-prefix>-<hash>-sd A deployment named addons-<uuid> Manually delete resources that are still listed in these two deployments and exist in the project (for example, Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions).
- Run a gcloud command to delete the deployments with the ABANDON policy: gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete addons-<uuid> \ --delete-policy = ABANDON gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete <location>-<env-name-prefix>-<hash>-sd \ --delete-policy = ABANDON Delete your Cloud Composer environment .
- We would like to clarify that no action is required on your side if you are using Cloud Composer and you are not using Deployment Manager directly to manage Google Cloud resources mentioned in the Deployment Manager's announcement.
