- To ensure that web server remains accessible regardless of DAG load time, you can configure asynchronous DAG loading to parse and load DAGs in the background at a pre-configured interval (available in composer-1.7.1-airflow-1.10.2 and later versions).
- To get the URL for the Airflow UI, run the following command in Google Cloud CLI: gcloud composer environments describe ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION Replace the following: ENVIRONMENT NAME : the name of your environment.
