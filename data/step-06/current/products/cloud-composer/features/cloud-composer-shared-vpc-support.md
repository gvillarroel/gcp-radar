Evidence snippets:
- In the host project: Edit permissions for the Composer Service Agent account, service- SERVICE PROJECT NUMBER @cloudcomposer-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com ) For this account, add another role on the project level: For Private IP environments, add the Composer Shared VPC Agent role.
- Service and host projects for Cloud Composer Shared VPC requires that you designate a host project to which networks and subnetworks belong and a service project , which is attached to the host project.
- If your Shared VPC configuration uses VPC Service Controls, use instructions for environments with VPC Service Controls instead: Configure connectivity to Google APIs and services .
- This allows the GKE Service Account of the service project to use the GKE Service Account of the host project to configure shared network resources. (Private IP, optional) Configure firewall rules and connectivity to Google domains In a Shared VPC configuration with Private IP environments, as an option, you might want to route all traffic to Google APIs and services through several IP addresses that belong to the private.googleapis.com domain and configure corresponding firewall rules.

Evidence snippets:
- If your project has a large-scale network configuration, such as one with hundreds of networks and many VPC peerings configured, then when you try to create new Cloud Composer environments, the operations might fail because of VPC, subnet or forwarding rules quota errors.
- About large-scale networks for Cloud Composer environments To overcome challenges related to these limits, you can organize your Cloud Composer environments into several VPC networks connected to your main/backbone VPC as it is described in the following sections.
- Home Documentation Data analytics Cloud Composer Composer 1 Guides Send feedback Configure large-scale networks for Cloud Composer environments Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- Large-scale network setup in a Shared VPC scenario To solve the network peering limits issue in a Shared VPC networks, organize your Cloud Composer environments into several projects and VPC networks connected to one backbone VPC.
