(Optional) Configure data encryption (CMEK) By default, data in your environment is encrypted with a key provided by Google.
- In the Dataplex data lineage integration section, select Disable integration with Dataplex data lineage . gcloud When you create an environment, the --disable-cloud-data-lineage-integration argument disables the data lineage integration. gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ --image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \ --service-account " SERVICE ACCOUNT " \ --disable-cloud-data-lineage-integration Replace: ENVIRONMENT NAME with the name of the environment.

Evidence snippets:
- For more information about networking in Cloud Composer, see pages for individual networking features: Public IP and Private IP environments Connecting an environment to your VPC network Shared VPC environments Configuring VPC Service Controls Other features of Cloud Composer Other Cloud Composer features include: Autoscaling environments Development with local Airflow environments Highly resilient environments Environment snapshots Data lineage integration with Dataplex Universal Catalog Encryption with customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) Frequently Asked Questions What version of Apache Airflow does Cloud Composer use?
- Environment networking Cloud Composer supports several networking configurations for environments, with many configuration options.
- Logging and monitoring for DAGs, Airflow components, and Cloud Composer environments: You can view Airflow logs that are associated with single DAG tasks in the Airflow web interface and the logs folder in the environment's bucket .
- Cloud Composer helps you create managed Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow-native tools, such as the powerful Airflow web interface and command-line tools, so you can focus on your workflows and not your infrastructure.
