- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Before you begin The Airflow UI with Access Control is available for Cloud Composer versions 1.13.4 or later versions and Airflow 1.10.10 and later versions.
- To preregister a user with a custom role through Google Cloud CLI, run the following Airflow CLI command : gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ users create -- \ -r ROLE \ -e USER EMAIL \ -u USER EMAIL \ -f FIRST NAME \ -l LAST NAME \ --use-random-password # The password value is required, but is not used Replace the following: ENVIRONMENT NAME : the name of the environment LOCATION : the region where the environment is located ROLE : an Airflow role for the user, for example, Op USER EMAIL : the user's email address FIRST NAME and LAST NAME : user's first name and last name Example: gcloud composer environments run example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ users create -- \ -r Op \ -e "example-user@example.com" \ -u "example-user@example.com" \ -f "Name" \ -l "Surname" \ --use-random-password Remove users Deleting a user from Airflow does not revoke access for that user, because they are automatically registered again next time they access the Airflow UI.

Evidence snippets:
- Cloud Composer 3 Cloud Composer 2 Cloud Composer 1 Apache Airflow includes a web user interface called Airflow UI , which you can use to manage Airflow DAGs, view DAG run logs, monitor Airflow, and perform administrative actions.
- The Airflow UI Access Control (Airflow Role-Based Access Control) feature for the Airflow UI is supported for Cloud Composer environments running Composer version 1.13.4 or later, Airflow version 1.10.10 or later, and Python 3.
- Example: // PATCH https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/example-project/ // locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment?updateMask= // config.webServerNetworkAccessControl { "config" : { "webServerNetworkAccessControl" : { "allowedIpRanges" : [ { "value" : "192.0.2.0/24" , "description" : "example range" }, { "value" : "192.0.4.0/24" , "description" : "example range 2" } ] } } } Terraform In the allowed ip range block, in the web server network access control specify IP ranges that can access web server. resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = " ENVIRONMENT NAME " region = " LOCATION " config { web server network access control { allowed ip range { value = " WS IP RANGE " description = " WS RANGE DESCRIPTION " } } } } Replace the following: WS IP RANGE : the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access the Airflow UI.
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { web server network access control { allowed ip range { value = "192.0.2.0/24" description = "example range" }, allowed ip range { value = "192.0.4.0/24" description = "example range 2" } } } What's next Airflow UI Access Control Troubleshooting Airflow web server issues Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
