Evidence snippets:
- Warnings about duplicate entries of 'echo' task belonging to the 'echo-airflow monitoring' DAG You might see the following entry in the Airflow logs: in query db.query(q) File "/opt/python3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/MySQLdb/ connections.py", line 280, in query mysql.connection.query(self, query) mysql exceptions.IntegrityError: (1062, "Duplicate entry 'echo-airflow monitoring-2020-10-20 15:59:40.000000' for key 'PRIMARY'") You can ignore these log entries, because this error doesn't impact Airflow DAG and task processing.

- Warnings about Pod Disruption Budget for environment clusters You can see the following warnings in the GKE UI for Cloud Composer environment clusters: GKE can't perform maintenance because the Pod Disruption Budget allows for 0 Pod evictions.
- Non-continuous DAG parse times and DAG bag size diagrams in monitoring Non-continuous DAG parse times and DAG bag size diagrams on the monitoring dashboard indicate problems with long DAG parse times (more than 5 minutes).
