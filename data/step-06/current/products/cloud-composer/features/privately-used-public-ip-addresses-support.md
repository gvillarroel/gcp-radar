Evidence snippets:
- Example (Private IP environment): gcloud composer environments create example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ --image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \ --enable-ip-alias \ --enable-private-environment \ --enable-privately-used-public-ips \ --enable-master-authorized-networks \ --master-authorized-networks 192 .0.2.0/23,192.0.4.0/23 API Construct an environments.create API request.
- For Public IP environments, this removes previously configured restrictions. gcloud To disable authorized networks, use the --disable-master-authorized-networks argument. gcloud composer environments update ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ --disable-master-authorized-networks Replace: ENVIRONMENT NAME with the name of the environment.
- In Public IP environments, you can configure authorized networks to restrict the range of IP addresses that can access the control plane of your environment's cluster.
- Example (Private IP environment): // POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ /locations/ }/environments { "name" : "example-environment" , "config" : { "nodeConfig" : { "ipAllocationPolicy" : { "useIpAliases" : true , } }, "privateEnvironmentConfig" : { "enablePrivateEnvironment" : true , }, "masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig" : { "enabled" : true , "cidrBlocks" : [ { "displayName" : "example range 1" , "cidrBlock" : "192.0.2.0/23" }, { "displayName" : "example range 2" , "cidrBlock" : "192.0.4.0/23" } ] } } } Terraform When you create an environment, the master authorized networks config block in the config block controls authorized networks for your environment.

Evidence snippets:
- As an option, you can also use privately used public IP addresses and the IP Masquerade agent to save the IP address space and to use non-RFC 1918 addresses.
- Cloud Composer environments use the following domains: .googleapis.com is used to access other Google services. .pkg.dev is used to get environment images, such as when creating or updating an environment. .gcr.io GKE requires connectivity to Container Registry domain regardless of Cloud Composer version.
- For Private IP environments, Cloud Composer assigns only private IP ( RFC 1918 ) addresses to the managed Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud SQL VMs in your environment.
- To get IP ranges for a subnetwork, go to VPC Networks page and click on the network's name to see details: Go to VPC Networks VPC-native cluster configuration Cloud Composer supports VPC-native GKE clusters in your environment.
