Evidence snippets:
- For example, a period of 4 hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday provides the required amount of time. gcloud The following arguments define maintenance windows parameters: --maintenance-window-start sets the start time of a maintenance window. --maintenance-window-end sets the end time of a maintenance window. --maintenance-window-recurrence sets the maintenance window recurrence . gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ --image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \ --service-account " SERVICE ACCOUNT " \ --maintenance-window-start ' DATETIME START ' \ --maintenance-window-end ' DATETIME END ' \ --maintenance-window-recurrence ' MAINTENANCE RECURRENCE ' Replace: ENVIRONMENT NAME with the name of the environment.
