- Final score: 25
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Save a copy of the quickstart.py file on your local machine: import datetime from airflow import models from airflow.operators import bash If you are running Airflow in more than one time zone see https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/timezone.html for best practices YESTERDAY = datetime . datetime . now () - datetime . timedelta ( days = 1 ) default args = { "owner" : "Composer Example" , "depends on past" : False , "email" : [ "" ], "email on failure" : False , "email on retry" : False , "retries" : 1 , "retry delay" : datetime . timedelta ( minutes = 5 ), "start date" : YESTERDAY , } with models .

- For example, to trigger a DAG named sample quickstart with the ID 5077 in your Cloud Composer environment: Airflow 2 gcloud composer environments run example-environment \ --location us-central1 dags trigger -- sample quickstart \ --run-id = 5077 Airflow 1 gcloud composer environments run example-environment \ --location us-central1 trigger dag -- sample quickstart \ --run id = 5077 What's next Access Airflow UI Access control (Airflow CLI) Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- Cloud Composer 3 Cloud Composer 2 Cloud Composer 1 Apache Airflow has a command-line interface (CLI) that you can use to perform tasks such as triggering and managing DAGs, getting information about DAG runs and tasks, adding and deleting connections and users.
- Run Airflow CLI commands with gcloud CLI To run Airflow CLI commands in your environments, use gcloud CLI: gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ SUBCOMMAND \ -- SUBCOMMAND ARGUMENTS Replace the following: ENVIRONMENT NAME : the name of your environment.

Evidence snippets:
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { web server network access control { allowed ip range { value = "192.0.2.0/24" description = "example range" }, allowed ip range { value = "192.0.4.0/24" description = "example range 2" } } } What's next Airflow UI Access Control Troubleshooting Airflow web server issues Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- Cloud Composer 3 Cloud Composer 2 Cloud Composer 1 Apache Airflow includes a web user interface called Airflow UI , which you can use to manage Airflow DAGs, view DAG run logs, monitor Airflow, and perform administrative actions.
- Example: // PATCH https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/example-project/ // locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment?updateMask= // config.webServerNetworkAccessControl { "config" : { "webServerNetworkAccessControl" : { "allowedIpRanges" : [ { "value" : "192.0.2.0/24" , "description" : "example range" }, { "value" : "192.0.4.0/24" , "description" : "example range 2" } ] } } } Terraform In the allowed ip range block, in the web server network access control specify IP ranges that can access web server. resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = " ENVIRONMENT NAME " region = " LOCATION " config { web server network access control { allowed ip range { value = " WS IP RANGE " description = " WS RANGE DESCRIPTION " } } } } Replace the following: WS IP RANGE : the IP range, in the CIDR notation, that can access the Airflow UI.
- To ensure that web server remains accessible regardless of DAG load time, you can configure asynchronous DAG loading to parse and load DAGs in the background at a pre-configured interval (available in composer-1.7.1-airflow-1.10.2 and later versions).
