Evidence snippets:
- Airflow 1.9.0 stores and expects the log names to be in the following format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06/1.log Airflow 1.10.x stores and expects the log names to be in the following format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log As a result, if you upgrade from Airflow 1.9.0 to Airflow 1.10.x and would like to read the log for a task executed with Airflow 1.9.0, the Airflow Web server will show the following error message: Unable to read remote log from BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log Workaround: Rename the logs generated by Airflow 1.9.0 in the Cloud Storage bucket using the format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log Cannot create Cloud Composer environments with the organization policy constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging enforced Cloud Composer environment creation fails if the constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging organization policy is enforced on the target project.
- Only the following list of Non-RFC 1918 ranges is supported in Cloud Composer: 100.64.0.0/10 192.0.0.0/24 192.0.2.0/24 192.88.99.0/24 198.18.0.0/15 198.51.100.0/24 203.0.113.0/24 240.0.0.0/4 Airflow UI does not show tasks logs when DAG Serialization is on in Composer 1.10.2 and Composer 1.10.3 Enabling DAG serialization in environments using Composer versions 1.10.2 and 1.10.3 prevents logs from showing in the Airflow web server.
- Airflow workers or schedulers might experience issues when accessing the environment's Cloud Storage bucket Cloud Composer uses gcsfuse to access the /data folder in the environment's bucket and to save Airflow task logs to the /logs directory (if enabled).
- Logs for Airflow tasks aren't collected if [core]execute tasks new python interpreter is set to True Cloud Composer doesn't collect logs for Airflow tasks if the [core]execute tasks new python interpreter Airflow configuration option is set to True .

- You can use this approach in all versions of Airflow supported by Cloud Composer 3, including Airflow 3 versions later than 3.1.7 where direct access to the Airflow database is no longer possible.
