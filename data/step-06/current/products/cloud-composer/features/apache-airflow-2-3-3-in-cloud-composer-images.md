- Run an Apache Airflow DAG in Cloud Composer 3 Cloud Composer 3 Cloud Composer 2 Cloud Composer 1 This quickstart guide shows you how to create a Cloud Composer environment and run an Apache Airflow DAG in Cloud Composer 3.
- Save a copy of the quickstart.py file on your local machine: import datetime from airflow import models from airflow.operators import bash If you are running Airflow in more than one time zone see https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/timezone.html for best practices YESTERDAY = datetime . datetime . now () - datetime . timedelta ( days = 1 ) default args = { "owner" : "Composer Example" , "depends on past" : False , "email" : [ "" ], "email on failure" : False , "email on retry" : False , "retries" : 1 , "retry delay" : datetime . timedelta ( minutes = 5 ), "start date" : YESTERDAY , } with models .

Evidence snippets:
- Per-folder Roles Registration is available in Cloud Composer 1.18.12 and later versions in Airflow 2, and in Cloud Composer 1.13.4 and later versions in Airflow 1.
- Before you begin The Airflow UI with Access Control is available for Cloud Composer versions 1.13.4 or later versions and Airflow 1.10.10 and later versions.
- To preregister a user with a custom role through Google Cloud CLI, run the following Airflow CLI command : gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ users create -- \ -r ROLE \ -e USER EMAIL \ -u USER EMAIL \ -f FIRST NAME \ -l LAST NAME \ --use-random-password # The password value is required, but is not used Replace the following: ENVIRONMENT NAME : the name of the environment LOCATION : the region where the environment is located ROLE : an Airflow role for the user, for example, Op USER EMAIL : the user's email address FIRST NAME and LAST NAME : user's first name and last name Example: gcloud composer environments run example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ users create -- \ -r Op \ -e "example-user@example.com" \ -u "example-user@example.com" \ -f "Name" \ -l "Surname" \ --use-random-password Remove users Deleting a user from Airflow does not revoke access for that user, because they are automatically registered again next time they access the Airflow UI.
