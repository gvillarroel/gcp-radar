Evidence snippets:
- Support for Google Display and Video 360 Operators Google Display and Video 360 Operators in Cloud Composer versions earlier than 2.1.13 are based on the Display and Video 360 v1.1 API that is deprecated and its sunset date is April 27, 2023.
- Add the cloud-airflow-prod@system.gserviceaccount.com service account as the member of your security perimeter by using the following configuration in the YAML conditions file: - members : - serviceAccount:cloud-airflow-prod@ system.gserviceaccount.com Cloud Composer 1 environment creation fails when the compute.requireOsLogin policy is enabled If compute.requireOsLogin policy is set to true in your project, then Cloud Composer 1 v1 environment creation operations fails.
- Environment is in the ERROR state after the project's billing account was deleted or deactivated, or the Cloud Composer API was disabled Cloud Composer environments affected by these problems are non-recoverable: After the project's billing account was deleted or deactivated, even if another account was linked later.
- Airflow workers or schedulers might experience issues when accessing the environment's Cloud Storage bucket Cloud Composer uses gcsfuse to access the /data folder in the environment's bucket and to save Airflow task logs to the /logs directory (if enabled).
