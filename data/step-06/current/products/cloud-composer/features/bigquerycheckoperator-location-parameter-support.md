- The command-line interface is the recommended approach for deleting the connection: gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ connections delete -- \ CONNECTION ID After deleting the connection, recreate it using the Airflow UI , ensuring that the fields you intend to leave empty are indeed left blank.
- Run a gcloud command to delete the deployments with the ABANDON policy: gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete addons-<uuid> \ --delete-policy = ABANDON gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete <location>-<env-name-prefix>-<hash>-sd \ --delete-policy = ABANDON Delete your Cloud Composer environment .

Evidence snippets:
- For example, a period of 4 hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday provides the required amount of time. gcloud The following arguments define maintenance windows parameters: --maintenance-window-start sets the start time of a maintenance window. --maintenance-window-end sets the end time of a maintenance window. --maintenance-window-recurrence sets the maintenance window recurrence . gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ --image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \ --service-account " SERVICE ACCOUNT " \ --maintenance-window-start ' DATETIME START ' \ --maintenance-window-end ' DATETIME END ' \ --maintenance-window-recurrence ' MAINTENANCE RECURRENCE ' Replace: ENVIRONMENT NAME with the name of the environment.
- Example: // POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ /locations/ }/environments { "name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" , "config" : { "nodeConfig" : { "location" : "projects/example-project/zones/us-central1-a" , "oauthScopes" : [ "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform" , "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery" ], "serviceAccount" : " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " }, "softwareConfig" : { "pythonVersion" : "3" } } } Terraform When you create an environment, following fields control miscellaneous parameters of your environment: zone field in the node config block specifies a Compute Engine zone for your environment VMs. oauth scopes field in the node config block specifies a comma-separated list of OAuth scopes. python version field in the software config block specifies the version of Python. resource "google composer environment" "example" { name = " ENVIRONMENT NAME " region = " LOCATION " config { node config { zone = " ZONE " oauth scopes = "[ OAUTH SCOPES ]" service account = " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } software config { python version = " PYTHON VERSION " } } } Replace: ZONE with the name of the Compute Engine zone.
- Example: gcloud composer environments create example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ --image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \ --service-account " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " \ --zone us-central1-a \ --node-count 6 \ --scheduler-count 1 \ --disk-size 50 \ --machine-type n1-standard-2 \ --cloud-sql-machine-type db-n1-standard-2 \ --web-server-machine-type composer-n1-webserver-2 API When you create an environment, in the Environment > EnvironmentConfig resource, specify environment scale and performance parameters. { "name" : "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT NAME " , "config" : { "nodeCount" : NODE COUNT , "nodeConfig" : { "machineType" : " NODE MACHINE TYPE " , "diskSizeGb" : DISK SIZE , "serviceAccount" : " SERVICE ACCOUNT " }, "softwareConfig" : { "schedulerCount" : SCHEDULER COUNT }, "databaseConfig" : { "machineType" : " SQL MACHINE TYPE " }, "webServerConfig" : { "machineType" : " WS MACHINE TYPE " } } } Replace: NODE COUNT with the number of nodes.
- The 1 January, 2023 date is ignored. gcloud composer environments create example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ --image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \ --service-account " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " \ --maintenance-window-start '2023-01-01T01:00:00Z' \ --maintenance-window-end '2023-01-01T07:00:00Z' \ --maintenance-window-recurrence 'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SU,WE,SA' API When you create an environment, in the Environment > EnvironmentConfig resource, specify maintenance windows parameters: { "name" : "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT NAME " , "config" : { "maintenanceWindow" : { "startTime" : " DATETIME START " , "endTime" : " DATETIME END " , "recurrence" : " MAINTENANCE RECURRENCE " }, "nodeConfig" : { "serviceAccount" : " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Replace: DATETIME START with the start date and time in the date/time input format .
