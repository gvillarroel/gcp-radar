- For more information about --triggerer-count , --triggerer-cpu , and --triggerer-memory flags, see Configure environment scale and performance parameters . --min-workers to 2 or more gcloud composer environments create ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ --image-version composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.33 \ --service-account " SERVICE ACCOUNT " \ --enable-high-resilience \ --enable-private-environment \ --scheduler-count 2 \ --triggerer-count 2 \ --triggerer-cpu 0 .5 \ --triggerer-memory 0 .5 \ --min-workers 2 API When you create an environment, in the Environment > EnvironmentConfig resource, enable the high resilience mode. { "name" : "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT NAME " , "config" : { "resilience mode" : "HIGH RESILIENCE" , "nodeConfig" : { "serviceAccount" : " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Example: // POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ /locations/ }/environments { "name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" , "config" : { "resilience mode" : "HIGH RESILIENCE" , "nodeConfig" : { "serviceAccount" : " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Terraform Note: An update to the resilience mode field causes a failure instead of leading to recreating the Cloud Composer environment.
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { workloads config { scheduler { cpu = 2.5 memory gb = 2.5 storage gb = 2 count = 1 } triggerer { count = 1 cpu = 0.5 memory gb = 0.5 } dag processor { cpu = 1 memory gb = 2 storage gb = 1 count = 1 } web server { cpu = 1 memory gb = 2.5 storage gb = 2 } worker { cpu = 1 memory gb = 2 storage gb = 2 min count = 2 max count = 4 } } environment size = "ENVIRONMENT SIZE SMALL" node config { service account = " example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Step 4. (Optional) Enable high resilience mode Highly resilient (Highly Available) Cloud Composer environments are environments that use built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms that reduce the environment's susceptibility to zonal failures and single point of failure outages.
- When you create an environment, the resilience mode field in the config block enables the high resilience mode. resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = " ENVIRONMENT NAME " region = " LOCATION " config { resilience mode = "HIGH RESILIENCE" node config { service account = " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { resilience mode = "HIGH RESILIENCE" node config { service account = " example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Step 5. (Optional) Specify a zone for the environment's database You can specify a preferred Cloud SQL zone when creating a standard resilience environment.
- Set the following arguments: --enable-high-resilience --enable-private-environment , and other networking parameters for a Private IP environment, if required --scheduler-count to 2 --triggerer-count to 0 or a value between 2 and 10 .

Evidence snippets:
- For more information about networking in Cloud Composer, see pages for individual networking features: Public IP and Private IP environments Connecting an environment to your VPC network Shared VPC environments Configuring VPC Service Controls Other features of Cloud Composer Other Cloud Composer features include: Autoscaling environments Development with local Airflow environments Highly resilient environments Environment snapshots Data lineage integration with Dataplex Universal Catalog Encryption with customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) Frequently Asked Questions What version of Apache Airflow does Cloud Composer use?
- Cloud Composer helps you create managed Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow-native tools, such as the powerful Airflow web interface and command-line tools, so you can focus on your workflows and not your infrastructure.
- Highly resilient (Highly Available) Cloud Composer environments have a multi-zonal Airflow database and a multi-zonal Airflow execution layer.
- The cluster also hosts other Cloud Composer components like Composer Agent and Airflow Monitoring, which help manage the Cloud Composer environment, gather logs to store in Cloud Logging, and gather metrics to upload to Cloud Monitoring.
