- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 309
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Users with the composer.environments.update permission can execute Python code on behalf of the environment's service account when installing packages in your environment.
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { software config { pypi packages = { scipy = ">=1.10.3" scikit-learn = "" nltk = "[machine learning]" } } } } Install packages from a public repository You can install packages hosted in other repositories that have a public IP address.
- You can use the --tree argument to get the result of the python -m pipdeptree --warn command. gcloud beta composer environments list-packages \ ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION Replace: ENVIRONMENT NAME with the name of the environment.
- Private IP environment with public internet access If your private IP environment can access public internet, then you can install packages using options for public IP environments: Install from PyPI.

- Source ID: `site-python-reference`
- Final score: 252
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- For example, to delete all pre-existing user-specified PyPI packages and install botocore at version 1.7.14, the updateMask would contain the path "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages", and the patch environment would be the following: :: { "config":{ "softwareConfig":{ "pypiPackages":{ "botocore":"==1.7.14" } } } } Note: Only the following fields can be updated: - config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages - Replace all custom custom PyPI packages.
- It will require modifications to work: - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization. - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in: https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/client options.html from google.cloud.orchestration.airflow import service v1 async def sample list environments(): Create a client client = service v1.
- For example, to set the version of scikit-learn to install in the environment to 0.19.0 and to remove an existing installation of numpy, the updateMask parameter would include the following two paths values: "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn" and "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.numpy".
- Supported for Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-1.\ . -airflow- . . . - config.webServerNetworkAccessControl - Replace the environment's current WebServerNetworkAccessControl . - config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides - Replace all Apache Airflow config overrides.

Evidence snippets:
- Python dependencies : You can install Python dependencies from the Python Package Index in your environment or from a private package repository, including Artifact Registry repositories.
- For more information about networking in Cloud Composer, see pages for individual networking features: Public IP and Private IP environments Private Service Connect environments Shared VPC environments Configuring VPC Service Controls Authorized networks IP Masquerade agent Privately used public IP ranges Other features of Cloud Composer Other Cloud Composer features include: Autoscaling environments Development with local Airflow environments Highly resilient environments Environment snapshots Data lineage integration with Dataplex Universal Catalog Encryption with customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) Frequently Asked Questions What version of Apache Airflow does Cloud Composer use?
- Logging and monitoring for DAGs, Airflow components, and Cloud Composer environments: You can view Airflow logs that are associated with single DAG tasks in the Airflow web interface and the logs folder in the environment's bucket .
- Cloud Composer helps you create managed Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow-native tools, such as the powerful Airflow web interface and command-line tools, so you can focus on your workflows and not your infrastructure.
