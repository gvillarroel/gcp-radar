# Private Python package repositories support

Product: Cloud Composer
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

Cloud Composer environments can install dependencies from private Python package repositories.

## Extended Definition

Cloud Composer environments can install dependencies from private Python package repositories.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

- Final score: 248
- Re-rank relevance: WEAK
- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- Users with the composer.environments.update permission can execute Python code on behalf of the environment's service account when installing packages in your environment.
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { software config { pypi packages = { scipy = ">=1.10.3" scikit-learn = "" nltk = "[machine learning]" } } } } Install packages from a public repository You can install packages hosted in other repositories that have a public IP address.
- You can use the --tree argument to get the result of the python -m pipdeptree --warn command. gcloud beta composer environments list-packages \ ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION Replace: ENVIRONMENT NAME with the name of the environment.
- Private IP environment with public internet access If your private IP environment can access public internet, then you can install packages using options for public IP environments: Install from PyPI.

- Source ID: `site-python-reference`
- Final score: 200
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, to delete all pre-existing user-specified PyPI packages and install botocore at version 1.7.14, the updateMask would contain the path "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages", and the patch environment would be the following: :: { "config":{ "softwareConfig":{ "pypiPackages":{ "botocore":"==1.7.14" } } } } Note: Only the following fields can be updated: - config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages - Replace all custom custom PyPI packages.
- It will require modifications to work: - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization. - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in: https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/client options.html from google.cloud.orchestration.airflow import service v1 async def sample list environments(): Create a client client = service v1.
- For example, to set the version of scikit-learn to install in the environment to 0.19.0 and to remove an existing installation of numpy, the updateMask parameter would include the following two paths values: "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn" and "config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.numpy".
- Supported for Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-1.\ . -airflow- . . . - config.webServerNetworkAccessControl - Replace the environment's current WebServerNetworkAccessControl . - config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides - Replace all Apache Airflow config overrides.
