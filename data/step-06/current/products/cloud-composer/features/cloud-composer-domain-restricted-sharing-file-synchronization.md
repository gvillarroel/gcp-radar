### Environment architecture \_|\_ Cloud Composer \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Final score: 156
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Environment architecture configurations Cloud Composer 1 environments can have the following architecture configurations: Public IP architecture Private IP architecture with VPC peerings Private IP with Domain restricted sharing (DRS) architecture Customer and tenant projects When you create an environment, Cloud Composer distributes the environment's resources between a tenant and a customer project: Customer project is a Google Cloud project where you create your environments.
- Private IP environment architecture (click to enlarge) If the Domain Restricted Sharing (DRS) organizational policy is turned on in your project, then Cloud Composer uses the Private IP with DRS environment architecture.
- When you upload your DAG files to the /dags folder in your environment's bucket, Cloud Composer synchronizes the DAGs to Airflow components of your environment.
- Public IP environment architecture (click to enlarge) In a Public IP environment architecture for Cloud Composer 1: The tenant project hosts a Cloud SQL instance, Cloud SQL storage, and a App Engine Flex instance that runs the Airflow web server.

- Final score: 143
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Cloud Composer environments use the following domains: .googleapis.com is used to access other Google services. .pkg.dev is used to get environment images, such as when creating or updating an environment. .gcr.io GKE requires connectivity to Container Registry domain regardless of Cloud Composer version.
- Configure connectivity to the restricted.googleapis.com endpoint: Domain DNS name CNAME Record A Record .googleapis.com googleapis.com.
- If a Cloud Composer environment is protected by a perimeter, access to public PyPI repositories is restricted.
- Make sure that your service perimeter has the following VPC accessible services, otherwise your environment might fail to create: Cloud Composer API (composer.googleapis.com) Compute Engine API (compute.googleapis.com) Kubernetes Engine API (container.googleapis.com) Container Registry API (containerregistry.googleapis.com) Artifact Registry API (artifactregistry.googleapis.com) Cloud Storage API (storage.googleapis.com) Cloud SQL Admin API (sqladmin.googleapis.com) Cloud Logging API (logging.googleapis.com) Cloud Monitoring API (monitoring.googleapis.com) Cloud Pub/Sub API (pubsub.googleapis.com) Cloud Cloud Resource Manager API (cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com) Service Directory API (servicedirectory.googleapis.com) Cloud Key Management Service API (cloudkms.googleapis.com), if you are using Cloud KMS or CMEK keys.

### Known issues \_|\_ Cloud Composer \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-1/known-issues](https://docs.cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-1/known-issues)
- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 140
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If you use Private Google Access and send traffic over private.googleapis.com Virtual IPs, or VPC Service Controls and send traffic over restricted.googleapis.com Virtual IPs, make sure that your Cloud DNS is configured also for .composer.cloud.google.com domain names.
- Add the cloud-airflow-prod@system.gserviceaccount.com service account as the member of your security perimeter by using the following configuration in the YAML conditions file: - members : - serviceAccount:cloud-airflow-prod@ system.gserviceaccount.com Cloud Composer 1 environment creation fails when the compute.requireOsLogin policy is enabled If compute.requireOsLogin policy is set to true in your project, then Cloud Composer 1 v1 environment creation operations fails.
- This problem happens because the DAG file is synchronized between your environment's bucket, Airflow workers, and Airflow schedulers of your environment.
- Airflow 1.9.0 stores and expects the log names to be in the following format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06/1.log Airflow 1.10.x stores and expects the log names to be in the following format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log As a result, if you upgrade from Airflow 1.9.0 to Airflow 1.10.x and would like to read the log for a task executed with Airflow 1.9.0, the Airflow Web server will show the following error message: Unable to read remote log from BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log Workaround: Rename the logs generated by Airflow 1.9.0 in the Cloud Storage bucket using the format: BUCKET/logs/DAG/2020-03-30T10:29:06+00:00/1.log Cannot create Cloud Composer environments with the organization policy constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging enforced Cloud Composer environment creation fails if the constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging organization policy is enforced on the target project.
