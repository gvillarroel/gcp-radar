Evidence snippets:
- Feature Improved Composer logs: Composer Agent adds more detailed logs in Cloud Monitoring to describe the current stage of environment creation and provide better error messages if an operation fails.
- Change Cloud Composer 1.19.6 and 2.0.23 images are available: composer-1.19.6-airflow-1.10.15 (default) composer-1.19.6-airflow-2.1.4 composer-1.19.6-airflow-2.2.5 composer-2.0.23-airflow-2.1.4 composer-2.0.23-airflow-2.2.5 July 28, 2022 Fixed (Available without upgrading) Fixed a problem where DAG import errors were not displayed on the Environment details page, if the error messages did not have a creation time set.
- Feature (Cloud Composer 3) New metrics are available for Cloud Composer 3 environments: CPU quota limit for Cloud Composer workloads CPU quota usage for Cloud Composer workloads Change (Available without upgrading) Improved the error message generated when the Cloud Composer Service Agent service account is missing permissions on the project or on the environment's service account.
- Fixed (Available without upgrading, Cloud Composer 1) Error messages related to the environment's cluster creation are now always propagated to error messages for Cloud Composer operations.
