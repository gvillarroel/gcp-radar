- COMPOSER 3 LOCATION with the region where the environment is located. (Airflow versions 2.9.1 and later) If there are quota errors while unpausing a large number of DAGs, you can use the following Airflow CLI commands to unpause all DAGs at once: gcloud composer environments run COMPOSER 3 ENV dags unpause \ --project PROJECT ID \ --location COMPOSER 3 LOCATION \ -- -y --treat-dag-id-as-regex ". " (Airflow versions earlier than 2.9.1) If there are quota errors while unpausing a large number of DAGs, it's possible to unpause DAGs using the Airflow REST API .
