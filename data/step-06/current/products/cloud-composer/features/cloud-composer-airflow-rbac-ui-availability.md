Evidence snippets:
- To preregister a user with a custom role through Google Cloud CLI, run the following Airflow CLI command : gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ users create -- \ -r ROLE \ -e USER EMAIL \ -u USER EMAIL \ -f FIRST NAME \ -l LAST NAME \ --use-random-password # The password value is required, but is not used Replace the following: ENVIRONMENT NAME : the name of the environment LOCATION : the region where the environment is located ROLE : an Airflow role for the user, for example, Op USER EMAIL : the user's email address FIRST NAME and LAST NAME : user's first name and last name Example: gcloud composer environments run example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ users create -- \ -r Op \ -e "example-user@example.com" \ -u "example-user@example.com" \ -f "Name" \ -l "Surname" \ --use-random-password Remove users Deleting a user from Airflow does not revoke access for that user, because they are automatically registered again next time they access the Airflow UI.
- Section Key Value webserver rbac user registration role User or other non-Admin role Admins can now configure Airflow UI access control for new users, including granting the Admin role to other users.
- Airflow 1 To enable the Airflow UI with Access Control, override the following Airflow configuration option: Section Key Value webserver rbac True You can do so for an existing environment, or when creating a new environment.
- If you upload DAGs to subfolders with names that match built-in Airflow roles and roles created by Cloud Composer, then permissions to DAGs in these subfolders are still assigned to these roles.

Evidence snippets:
- Enable the API To get the permissions that you need to complete this quickstart, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your project: To assign IAM roles and permissions: Project IAM Admin ( roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin ) To create a service account for the Cloud Composer environment: Create Service Accounts ( roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator ) To view create and manage the Cloud Composer environment: Environment and Storage Object Administrator ( roles/composer.environmentAndStorageObjectAdmin ) Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) To view logs: Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- Save a copy of the quickstart.py file on your local machine: import datetime from airflow import models from airflow.operators import bash If you are running Airflow in more than one time zone see https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/timezone.html for best practices YESTERDAY = datetime . datetime . now () - datetime . timedelta ( days = 1 ) default args = { "owner" : "Composer Example" , "depends on past" : False , "email" : [ "" ], "email on failure" : False , "email on retry" : False , "retries" : 1 , "retry delay" : datetime . timedelta ( minutes = 5 ), "start date" : YESTERDAY , } with models .
- DAG ( "composer quickstart" , catchup = False , default args = default args , schedule interval = datetime . timedelta ( days = 1 ), ) as dag : Print the dag run id from the Airflow logs print dag run conf = bash .
- The list of DAGs displays the composer quickstart DAG (click to enlarge) Note: The airflow monitoring DAG is used by Cloud Composer to monitor the health of your environment.
