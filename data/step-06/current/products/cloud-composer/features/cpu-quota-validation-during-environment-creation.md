- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { software config { airflow config overrides = { core-dags are paused at creation = "True" webserver-dag orientation = "TB" } env variables = { SENDGRID MAIL FROM = "user@example.com" SENDGRID API KEY = "example-key" } } node config { service account = " example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Step 10. (Optional) Specify maintenance windows Default maintenance windows in Cloud Composer 3 are defined in the following way: All times are in the local time zone of the region where your environment is located, but with daylight saving time ignored.
