Evidence snippets:
- This script is intended to be used with Composer 1 environments In Composer 2, the Airflow Webserver is not in the tenant project so there is no tenant client ID See https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/environment-architecture for more details import google.auth import google.auth.transport.requests import requests import six.moves.urllib.parse Authenticate with Google Cloud.
- In Airflow 2, run the following Airflow CLI command: gcloud composer environments run ENVIRONMENT NAME \ --location LOCATION \ users create -- \ -u accounts.google.com: NUMERIC USER ID \ -e UNIQUE ID \ -f UNIQUE ID \ -l - -r Op --use-random-password Replace: ENVIRONMENT NAME with the name of the environment.

Evidence snippets:
- Triggering DAGs through Google Cloud CLI might cause your environment to reach the quota limit, and as a result, Airflow CLI commands will no longer be executed.
- Example: gcloud composer environments run example-environment \ dags list -- --output = json Airflow 1 Specify CLI commands as a sub-command.
- For a full list of supported Airflow CLI commands, see the reference for the gcloud composer environments run command.
- For example, to trigger a DAG named sample quickstart with the ID 5077 in your Cloud Composer environment: Airflow 2 gcloud composer environments run example-environment \ --location us-central1 dags trigger -- sample quickstart \ --run-id = 5077 Airflow 1 gcloud composer environments run example-environment \ --location us-central1 trigger dag -- sample quickstart \ --run id = 5077 What's next Access Airflow UI Access control (Airflow CLI) Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
