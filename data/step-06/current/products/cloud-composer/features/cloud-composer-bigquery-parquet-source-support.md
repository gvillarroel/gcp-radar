Evidence snippets:
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example environment" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { // Other environment parameters master authorized networks config { enabled = true cidr blocks { cidr block = "192.0.2.0/23" display name = "example range 1" } cidr blocks { cidr block = "192.0.4.0/23" display name = "example range 2" } } } } Disable authorized networks You can disable authorized networks for an existing environment: For Private IP environments, this removes access for ranges that were previously added as authorized network.
- Example (Private IP environment): resource "google composer environment" "example environment" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { node config { // Specify your network and subnetwork network = google compute network.example network.id subnetwork = google compute subnetwork.example subnet.id ip allocation policy = [{ use ip aliases = true }] } private environment config { // Private environment parameters } master authorized networks config { enabled = true cidr blocks { cidr block = "192.0.2.0/23" display name = "example range 1" } cidr blocks { cidr block = "192.0.4.0/23" display name = "example range 2" } } } } Specify authorized networks for an existing environment You can specify authorized networks for an existing environment. gcloud To specify authorized networks, use the --enable-master-authorized-networks argument.
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example environment" { provider = google-beta name = "example environment" region = "us-central1" config { // Other environment parameters master authorized networks config { enabled = false } } } What's next Configuring Private IP environments Creating environments About Private IP environments Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- To add authorized networks for a Private IP environment, add this block to your environment definition: resource "google composer environment" "example environment" { provider = google-beta name = "example environment" region = "us-central1" config { // Other environment parameters master authorized networks config { enabled = true cidr blocks { cidr block = " AUTHORIZED NETWORK RANGE " display name = " AUTHORIZED NETWORK NAME " } } } } Replace: AUTHORIZED NETWORK RANGE with an IP address range in the CIDR notation.
