Evidence snippets:
- Example (Private IP environment): resource "google composer environment" "example environment" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { node config { // Specify your network and subnetwork network = google compute network.example network.id subnetwork = google compute subnetwork.example subnet.id ip allocation policy = [{ use ip aliases = true }] } private environment config { // Private environment parameters } master authorized networks config { enabled = true cidr blocks { cidr block = "192.0.2.0/23" display name = "example range 1" } cidr blocks { cidr block = "192.0.4.0/23" display name = "example range 2" } } } } Specify authorized networks for an existing environment You can specify authorized networks for an existing environment. gcloud To specify authorized networks, use the --enable-master-authorized-networks argument.
- Example (Private IP environment): // POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ /locations/ }/environments { "name" : "example-environment" , "config" : { "nodeConfig" : { "ipAllocationPolicy" : { "useIpAliases" : true , } }, "privateEnvironmentConfig" : { "enablePrivateEnvironment" : true , }, "masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig" : { "enabled" : true , "cidrBlocks" : [ { "displayName" : "example range 1" , "cidrBlock" : "192.0.2.0/23" }, { "displayName" : "example range 2" , "cidrBlock" : "192.0.4.0/23" } ] } } } Terraform When you create an environment, the master authorized networks config block in the config block controls authorized networks for your environment.
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example environment" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { // Other environment parameters master authorized networks config { enabled = true cidr blocks { cidr block = "192.0.2.0/23" display name = "example range 1" } cidr blocks { cidr block = "192.0.4.0/23" display name = "example range 2" } } } } Disable authorized networks You can disable authorized networks for an existing environment: For Private IP environments, this removes access for ranges that were previously added as authorized network.
- Example: // PATCH https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/projects/example-project/ // locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment?updateMask= // config.softwareConfig.masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig "config" : { "masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig" : { "enabled" : true , "cidrBlocks" : [ { "displayName" : "example range 1" , "cidrBlock" : "192.0.2.0/23" }, { "displayName" : "example range 2" , "cidrBlock" : "192.0.4.0/23" } ] } } Terraform The master authorized networks config block in the config block controls authorized networks for your environment.

- This prevents all internet access to the control plane. --enable-master-authorized-networks and --master-authorized-networks arguments configure authorized networks for your environment. --enable-privately-used-public-ips configures privately used public IP addresses for your environment. --enable-ip-masq-agent enables the IP Masquerade agent .
- Using this option sets the level of access for the control plane to "Public endpoint access enabled, authorized networks enabled" .
