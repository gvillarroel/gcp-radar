# Cloud Composer 3 highly resilient environments

Product: Cloud Composer
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

Highly resilient environments are generally available in Cloud Composer 3, beginning with Airflow builds composer-3-airflow-2.10.2-build.13 and composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.20.

## Extended Definition

Highly resilient environments are generally available in Cloud Composer 3, beginning with Airflow builds composer-3-airflow-2.10.2-build.13 and composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.20.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

Evidence snippets:
- Example: resource "google composer environment" "example" { provider = google-beta name = "example-environment" region = "us-central1" config { workloads config { scheduler { cpu = 2.5 memory gb = 2.5 storage gb = 2 count = 1 } triggerer { count = 1 cpu = 0.5 memory gb = 0.5 } dag processor { cpu = 1 memory gb = 2 storage gb = 1 count = 1 } web server { cpu = 1 memory gb = 2.5 storage gb = 2 } worker { cpu = 1 memory gb = 2 storage gb = 2 min count = 2 max count = 4 } } environment size = "ENVIRONMENT SIZE SMALL" node config { service account = " example-account@example-project . iam.gserviceaccount.com " } } } Step 4. (Optional) Enable high resilience mode Highly resilient (Highly Available) Cloud Composer environments are environments that use built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms that reduce the environment's susceptibility to zonal failures and single point of failure outages.
- In Cloud Composer 3, highly resilient environments are available starting from Airflow builds composer-3-airflow-2.10.2-build.13 and composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.20.
- Highly resilient environments are more resilient to this issue, because their databases are located in two separate zones.

Evidence snippets:
- Highly resilient environments are more resilient to this issue, because their databases are located in two separate zones.
- Example: // POST https://composer.googleapis.com/v1/{parent=projects/ /locations/ }/environments { "name" : "projects/example-project/locations/us-central1/environments/example-environment" , "config" : { "nodeConfig" : { "location" : "projects/example-project/zones/us-central1-a" , "oauthScopes" : [ "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform" , "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery" ], "serviceAccount" : " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " }, "softwareConfig" : { "pythonVersion" : "3" } } } Terraform When you create an environment, following fields control miscellaneous parameters of your environment: zone field in the node config block specifies a Compute Engine zone for your environment VMs. oauth scopes field in the node config block specifies a comma-separated list of OAuth scopes. python version field in the software config block specifies the version of Python. resource "google composer environment" "example" { name = " ENVIRONMENT NAME " region = " LOCATION " config { node config { zone = " ZONE " oauth scopes = "[ OAUTH SCOPES ]" service account = " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } software config { python version = " PYTHON VERSION " } } } Replace: ZONE with the name of the Compute Engine zone.
- Example: gcloud composer environments create example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ --image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \ --service-account " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " \ --zone us-central1-a \ --node-count 6 \ --scheduler-count 1 \ --disk-size 50 \ --machine-type n1-standard-2 \ --cloud-sql-machine-type db-n1-standard-2 \ --web-server-machine-type composer-n1-webserver-2 API When you create an environment, in the Environment > EnvironmentConfig resource, specify environment scale and performance parameters. { "name" : "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT NAME " , "config" : { "nodeCount" : NODE COUNT , "nodeConfig" : { "machineType" : " NODE MACHINE TYPE " , "diskSizeGb" : DISK SIZE , "serviceAccount" : " SERVICE ACCOUNT " }, "softwareConfig" : { "schedulerCount" : SCHEDULER COUNT }, "databaseConfig" : { "machineType" : " SQL MACHINE TYPE " }, "webServerConfig" : { "machineType" : " WS MACHINE TYPE " } } } Replace: NODE COUNT with the number of nodes.
- Example: gcloud composer environments create example-environment \ --location us-central1 \ --image-version composer-1.20.12-airflow-1.10.15 \ --service-account " example-account@example-project. iam.gserviceaccount.com " \ --env-variables SENDGRID MAIL FROM = user@example.com,SENDGRID API KEY = example-key \ --airflow-configs core-dags are paused at creation = True,webserver-dag orientation = TB API When you create an environment, in the Environment > EnvironmentConfig resource, specify environment variables and Airflow configuration overrides. { "name" : "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /environments/ ENVIRONMENT NAME " , "config" : { "softwareConfig" : { "airflowConfigOverrides" : { " SECTION - KEY " : " OVERRIDE VALUE " }, "envVariables" : { " VAR NAME " : " VAR VALUE " , } }, "nodeConfig" : { "serviceAccount" : " SERVICE ACCOUNT " } } } Replace: SECTION with the section in the configuration file where the Airflow configuration option is located.
