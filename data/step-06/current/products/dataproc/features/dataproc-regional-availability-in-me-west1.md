Evidence snippets:
- Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster In Cloud Shell, create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster and attach it to the DPMS instance: gcloud dataproc clusters create ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --dataproc-metastore=projects/ ${ PROJECT } /locations/ ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } /services/ ${ DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --image-version=2.0 Specify the cluster image as version 2.0 , which is the latest version available as of June 2021.
- Populate the metastore In Cloud Shell, update the sample retail.hql provided in this tutorial's repository with the name of the Hive data bucket: sed -i -- 's/ ${ WAREHOUSE BUCKET } /'" $WAREHOUSE BUCKET "'/g' retail.hql Run the queries contained in the retail.hql file to create the table definitions in the metastore: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster= ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --file=retail.hql Verify that the table definitions were correctly created: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster= ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --execute=" desc departments; desc categories; desc products; desc order items; desc orders; desc customers; select count( ) as num departments from departments; select count( ) as num categories from categories; select count( ) as num products from products; select count( ) as num order items from order items; select count( ) as num orders from orders; select count( ) as num customers from customers; " The output resembles the following: +------------------+------------+----------+ col name data type comment +------------------+------------+----------+ department id int department name string +------------------+------------+----------+ The output also contains the number of elements in each table—for example: +----------------+ num customers +----------------+ 12435 +----------------+ Failing over to the standby region This section provides the steps to failover from the primary region (region A) to the standby region (region B).
- Update the environment variables based on these new roles: export DPMS PRIMARY REGION = us - east1 export DPMS STANDBY REGION = us - central1 ] export DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE = dpms2 export DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE = dpms1 export HADOOP PRIMARY = dataproc - cluster2 export HADOOP STANDBY = dataproc - cluster1 Verify that you can write to the new primary Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore in region B: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE } \ --region ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --execute "create view completed orders as select from orders where order status = 'COMPLETE';" gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --execute "select from completed orders limit 5;" The output contains the following: +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ completed orders.order id completed orders.order date completed orders.order customer id completed orders.order status +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ 3 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 12111 COMPLETE 5 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 11318 COMPLETE 6 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 7130 COMPLETE 7 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 4530 COMPLETE 15 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 2568 COMPLETE +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ The failover is now complete.
- Create a new DPMS instance in the standby region: gcloud metastore services create ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --location= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --hive-metastore-version=3.1.2 Set the Hive data bucket as the default warehouse directory: gcloud metastore services update ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --location= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --update-hive-metastore-configs="hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=gs:// ${ PROJECT } -warehouse" Retrieve the path of the latest metadata backup: IMPORT DIR=gcloud storage ls gs:// ${ BACKUP BUCKET } sort -k 1 tail -1 IMPORT SQL=" ${ IMPORT DIR } hive.sql" echo ${ IMPORT SQL } Import the backed-up metadata into the new Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore instance: gcloud metastore services import gcs $ { DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ -- location = $ { DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ -- dump - type = mysql \ -- database - dump = $ { IMPORT SQL } \ -- import - id = import - $ ( date + "%Y-%m- %d -%H-%M-%S" ) Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster in the standby region (region B): gcloud dataproc clusters create ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --dataproc-metastore=projects/ ${ PROJECT } /locations/ ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } /services/ ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --region= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --image-version=2.0 Verify that the metadata was correctly imported: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --region ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --execute "select count( ) as num orders from orders;" The num orders output is most important to the tutorial.

Evidence snippets:
- Required roles To get the permissions that you need to use the Dataproc Metastore administrator interface, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your project, based on the principle of least privilege: To query Dataproc Metastore metadata: Metadata query administrator ( roles/metastore.metadataQueryAdmin ) on the user account or service account To alter the resource location of your metadata, including databases, tables and partitions, or move a table to another database: Metadata mutate administrator ( roles/metastore.metadataMutateAdmin ) on the user account or service account Dataproc Metastore Editor ( roles/metastore.editor ) on the user account or service account For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- You can sign in by executing gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which account by executing gcloud auth list . curl -X POST -s -i \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ POST -d '{"resource name": " RESOURCE NAME ", "location uri":" LOCATION URI "}' \ -H "Content-Type:application/json" \ https://metastore.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /services/ SERVICE :alterLocation Replace the following: PROJECT ID : the Google Cloud project ID that your Dataproc Metastore service resides in.
- The following example shows a sample command that runs a select query from a database named DBS. curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"query": "select from DBS;"}' \ https://metastore.googleapis.com/projects/dpms/locations/us-central1/services/dpms1:queryMetadata Interpret the output of a query metadata operation When you first run a query metadata command, Dataproc Metastore automatically creates a Google Cloud folder in your artifacts Google Cloud bucket.
- You can check the active account by executing gcloud auth list . curl -X POST -s -i \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ POST -d '{"table name": " TABLE NAME ", "db name": " DB NAME ", "destination db name": " DESTINATION DB NAME "}'\ -H "Content-Type:application/json" \ https://metastore.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /services/ SERVICE :moveTableToDatabase Replace the following: PROJECT ID : the Google Cloud project ID that your Dataproc Metastore service resides in.
