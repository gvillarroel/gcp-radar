- Fixed Fixed the ability to delete jobs that fast-failed before some cluster and staging directories were created Fixed some remaining errors with vmem settings when using the distcp command Fixed a rare bug in which underlying Compute Engine issues could lead to VM instances failing to be deleted after the Cloud Dataproc cluster had been successfully deleted Hive command has been fixed Fixed error reporting when updating the number of workers (standard and preemptible) in a cluster Fixed some cases when Rate Limit Exceeded errors occurred The maximum cluster name length is now correctly 55 instead of 56 characters GCP Console Cluster list now includes a Created column, and the cluster configuration tab now includes a Created field, telling the creation time of the cluster In the cluster-create screen, cluster memory sizes greater than 999 GB are now displayed in TB Fields that were missing from the PySpark and Hive job configuration tab ( Additional Python Files and Jar Files ) have been added The option to add preemptible nodes when creating a cluster is now in the "expander" at the bottom of the form Machine types with insufficient memory (less than 3.5 GB) are no longer displayed in the list of machine types (previously, selecting one of these small machine types would lead to an error from the backend The placeholder text in the Arguments field of the submit-job form has been corrected October 23, 2015 Feature GCP Console: Added support for adding, editing, and removing preemptible instances in clusters.
- Fixed Forced distcp settings to match mapred-site.xml settings to provide additional fixes for the distcp command (see this related JIRA ) Ensured that workers created during an update do not join the cluster until after custom initialization actions are complete Ensured that workers always disconnect from a cluster when the Cloud Dataproc agent is shutdown Fixed a race condition in the API frontend that occurred when validating a request and marking cluster as updating Enhanced validation checks for quota, Cloud Dataproc image, and initialization actions when updating clusters Improved handling of jobs when the Cloud Dataproc agent is restarted GCP Console Allowed duplicate arguments when submitting a job Replaced generic Failed to load message with details about the cause of an error when an error occurs that is not related to Cloud Dataproc When a single jar file for a job is submitted, allowed it to be listed only in the Main class or jar field on the Submit a Job form, and no longer required it to also be listed in the Jar files field November 18, 2015 Change Core service improvements If set, a project's default zone setting is now used as the default value for the zone in the create-cluster form in the GCP Console.
