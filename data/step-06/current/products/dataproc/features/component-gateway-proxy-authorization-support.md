- Costs In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud: Managed Service for Apache Spark Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore Cloud Run Cloud Scheduler Cloud Composer To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage, use the pricing calculator .
- In Cloud Shell, export the metadata from the DPMS instance: gcloud metastore services export gcs $ { DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE } \ -- location =$ { DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ -- destination - folder = gs : //$ { BACKUP BUCKET } Retrieve the path of the latest metadata backup: IMPORT DIR=gcloud storage ls gs:// ${ BACKUP BUCKET } sort -k 1 tail -1 IMPORT SQL=" ${ IMPORT DIR } hive.sql" echo ${ IMPORT SQL } Import the metadata into the standby DPMS instance in the original region (region A): gcloud metastore services import gcs $ { DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ -- location = $ { DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ -- dump - type = mysql \ -- database - dump = $ { IMPORT SQL } \ -- import - id = import - $ ( date + "%Y-%m- %d -%H-%M-%S" ) Verify that the metadata was correctly imported: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --region ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --execute "select from completed orders limit 5;" The output includes the following: +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ completed orders.order id completed orders.order date completed orders.order customer id completed orders.order status +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ 3 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 12111 COMPLETE 5 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 11318 COMPLETE 6 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 7130 COMPLETE 7 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 4530 COMPLETE 15 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 2568 COMPLETE +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ The primary Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore and standby Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore have swapped roles again.
- Populate the metastore In Cloud Shell, update the sample retail.hql provided in this tutorial's repository with the name of the Hive data bucket: sed -i -- 's/ ${ WAREHOUSE BUCKET } /'" $WAREHOUSE BUCKET "'/g' retail.hql Run the queries contained in the retail.hql file to create the table definitions in the metastore: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster= ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --file=retail.hql Verify that the table definitions were correctly created: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster= ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --execute=" desc departments; desc categories; desc products; desc order items; desc orders; desc customers; select count( ) as num departments from departments; select count( ) as num categories from categories; select count( ) as num products from products; select count( ) as num order items from order items; select count( ) as num orders from orders; select count( ) as num customers from customers; " The output resembles the following: +------------------+------------+----------+ col name data type comment +------------------+------------+----------+ department id int department name string +------------------+------------+----------+ The output also contains the number of elements in each table—for example: +----------------+ num customers +----------------+ 12435 +----------------+ Failing over to the standby region This section provides the steps to failover from the primary region (region A) to the standby region (region B).
- Update the environment variables based on these new roles: export DPMS PRIMARY REGION = us - east1 export DPMS STANDBY REGION = us - central1 ] export DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE = dpms2 export DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE = dpms1 export HADOOP PRIMARY = dataproc - cluster2 export HADOOP STANDBY = dataproc - cluster1 Verify that you can write to the new primary Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore in region B: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE } \ --region ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --execute "create view completed orders as select from orders where order status = 'COMPLETE';" gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --execute "select from completed orders limit 5;" The output contains the following: +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ completed orders.order id completed orders.order date completed orders.order customer id completed orders.order status +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ 3 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 12111 COMPLETE 5 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 11318 COMPLETE 6 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 7130 COMPLETE 7 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 4530 COMPLETE 15 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 2568 COMPLETE +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ The failover is now complete.
