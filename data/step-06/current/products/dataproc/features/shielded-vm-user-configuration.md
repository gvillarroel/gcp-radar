Evidence snippets:
- January 12, 2021 Feature Added support for user configuration of Compute Engine Shielded VMs in a Dataproc Cluster.
- Fixed Fixed the ability to delete jobs that fast-failed before some cluster and staging directories were created Fixed some remaining errors with vmem settings when using the distcp command Fixed a rare bug in which underlying Compute Engine issues could lead to VM instances failing to be deleted after the Cloud Dataproc cluster had been successfully deleted Hive command has been fixed Fixed error reporting when updating the number of workers (standard and preemptible) in a cluster Fixed some cases when Rate Limit Exceeded errors occurred The maximum cluster name length is now correctly 55 instead of 56 characters GCP Console Cluster list now includes a Created column, and the cluster configuration tab now includes a Created field, telling the creation time of the cluster In the cluster-create screen, cluster memory sizes greater than 999 GB are now displayed in TB Fields that were missing from the PySpark and Hive job configuration tab ( Additional Python Files and Jar Files ) have been added The option to add preemptible nodes when creating a cluster is now in the "expander" at the bottom of the form Machine types with insufficient memory (less than 3.5 GB) are no longer displayed in the list of machine types (previously, selecting one of these small machine types would lead to an error from the backend The placeholder text in the Arguments field of the submit-job form has been corrected October 23, 2015 Feature GCP Console: Added support for adding, editing, and removing preemptible instances in clusters.
- February 10, 2025 Announcement Dataproc on Compute Engine: To help diagnose Dataproc clusters, you can set the following cluster properties to true when you create a cluster : dataproc:diagnostic.capture.enabled : When set to true , enables the collection of checkpoint data in the cluster temp bucket . dataproc:dataproc.logging.extended.enabled : When set to true , enables the collection of logs for the Knox, Zeppelin, Solr, Trino, Presto, Ranger-usersync, Jupyter notebook components and the Spark History-Server in Cloud Logging . dataproc:dataproc.logging.syslog.enabled : When set to true , enables the collection of VM syslogs in Cloud Logging .
- Announcement Dataproc on Compute Engine: Starting August 18, 2025, the following diagnostic properties will be enabled by default for newly created Dataproc clusters: dataproc:diagnostic.capture.enabled : Enables the collection of checkpoint data in the cluster temp bucket . dataproc:dataproc.logging.extended.enabled : Enables the collection of logs for the Knox, Zeppelin, Ranger-usersync, Jupyter notebook, Jupyter kernel gateway components and the Spark History-Server in Cloud Logging . dataproc:dataproc.logging.syslog.enabled : Enables the collection of VM syslogs in Cloud Logging .
