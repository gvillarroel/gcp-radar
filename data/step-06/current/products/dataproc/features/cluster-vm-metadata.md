Evidence snippets:
- Fixed Fixed the ability to delete jobs that fast-failed before some cluster and staging directories were created Fixed some remaining errors with vmem settings when using the distcp command Fixed a rare bug in which underlying Compute Engine issues could lead to VM instances failing to be deleted after the Cloud Dataproc cluster had been successfully deleted Hive command has been fixed Fixed error reporting when updating the number of workers (standard and preemptible) in a cluster Fixed some cases when Rate Limit Exceeded errors occurred The maximum cluster name length is now correctly 55 instead of 56 characters GCP Console Cluster list now includes a Created column, and the cluster configuration tab now includes a Created field, telling the creation time of the cluster In the cluster-create screen, cluster memory sizes greater than 999 GB are now displayed in TB Fields that were missing from the PySpark and Hive job configuration tab ( Additional Python Files and Jar Files ) have been added The option to add preemptible nodes when creating a cluster is now in the "expander" at the bottom of the form Machine types with insufficient memory (less than 3.5 GB) are no longer displayed in the list of machine types (previously, selecting one of these small machine types would lead to an error from the backend The placeholder text in the Arguments field of the submit-job form has been corrected October 23, 2015 Feature GCP Console: Added support for adding, editing, and removing preemptible instances in clusters.
- December 16, 2015 Feature Cloud Dataproc clusters now have vim , git , and bash-completion installed by default The Cloud Dataproc API now has an official Maven artifact , Javadocs , and a downloadable .zip file GCP Console Properties can now be specified when submitting a job, and can be seen in the Configuration tab of a job A Clone button has been added that allows you to easily copy all information about a job to a new job submission form The left-side icons for Clusters and Jobs are now custom icons rather than generic ones An Image version field has been added to the bottom of the create cluster form that allows you to select a specific Cloud Dataproc image version when creating a cluster A VM Instances tab has been added on the cluster detail page, which you can use to display a list of all VMs in a cluster and easily SSH into the master node An Initialization Actions field has been added to the bottom of the create cluster form, which allows you to specify initialization actions when creating a cluster Paths to Cloud Storage buckets that are displayed in error messages are now clickable links.
- Announcement Announcing the General Availability (GA) release of Dataproc Serverless for Spark runtime versions 2.3 , which include the following components: Spark 3.5.1 BigQuery Spark Connector 0.42.3 Cloud Storage Connector 3.1.2 Java 17 Python 3.11 R 4.3 Scala 2.13 Announcement New Dataproc Serverless for Spark runtime versions : 1.1.105 1.2.49 2.2.49 2.3.0 May 23, 2025 Feature Dataproc now supports the creation of zero-scale clusters , available in preview .
- June 27, 2018 Feature Announcing the Beta release of Cloud Dataproc Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) , a feature that allows you to create, use, and revoke the key encryption key (KEK) for Compute Engine VMs in your cluster and the Cloud Storage bucket used with Cloud Dataproc.

Evidence snippets:
- For example, to change the number of workers in a cluster to 5, the update mask parameter would be specified as config.worker config.num instances , and the PATCH request body would specify the new value, as follows: :: { "config":{ "workerConfig":{ "numInstances":"5" } } } Similarly, to change the number of preemptible workers in a cluster to 5, the update mask parameter would be config.secondary worker config.num instances , and the PATCH request body would be set as follows: :: { "config":{ "secondaryWorkerConfig":{ "numInstances":"5" } } } Note: Currently, only the following fields can be updated: .. raw:: html Mask Purpose labels Update labels config.worker config.num instances Resize primary worker group config.secondary worker config.num instances Resize secondary worker group config.autoscaling config.policy uri Use, stop using, or change autoscaling policies This corresponds to the update mask field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set. retry google.api core.retry async.AsyncRetry Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried. timeout float The timeout for this request. metadata Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]] Key/value pairs which should be sent along with the request as metadata.
- Example filter: status.state = ACTIVE AND clusterName = mycluster AND labels.env = staging AND labels.starred = This corresponds to the filter field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set. retry google.api core.retry async.AsyncRetry Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried. timeout float The timeout for this request. metadata Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]] Key/value pairs which should be sent along with the request as metadata.
