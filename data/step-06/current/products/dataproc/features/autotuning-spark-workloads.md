Evidence snippets:
- "Managed Service for Apache Spark" is the new name for the product formerly known as "Dataproc on Compute Engine" (cluster deployment) and "Google Cloud Serverless for Apache Spark" (serverless deployment).
- For production environments, associate your cluster with a specific major.minor Managed Service for Apache Spark image version, as shown in the following gcloud CLI command. gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER NAME \ --region= region \ --image-version=2.0 Dataproc resolves the major.minor version to the latest sub-minor version version ( 2.0 is resolved to 2.0.x ).
- Control initialization action locations Initialization actions allow you to automatically run scripts or install components when you create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster (see the dataproc-initialization-actions GitHub repository for common Managed Service for Apache Spark initialization actions).
- Benefits of submitting jobs to Managed Service for Apache Spark: No complicated networking settings required - the API is widely reachable Easy to manage IAM permissions and roles Track job status easily - no Managed Service for Apache Spark job metadata to complicate results.
