Evidence snippets:
- October 01, 2020 Feature Launched Dataproc integration with Compute Engine sole-tenant nodes , which allows users to create a cluster in a sole-tenant node group .
- Fixed Fixed the ability to delete jobs that fast-failed before some cluster and staging directories were created Fixed some remaining errors with vmem settings when using the distcp command Fixed a rare bug in which underlying Compute Engine issues could lead to VM instances failing to be deleted after the Cloud Dataproc cluster had been successfully deleted Hive command has been fixed Fixed error reporting when updating the number of workers (standard and preemptible) in a cluster Fixed some cases when Rate Limit Exceeded errors occurred The maximum cluster name length is now correctly 55 instead of 56 characters GCP Console Cluster list now includes a Created column, and the cluster configuration tab now includes a Created field, telling the creation time of the cluster In the cluster-create screen, cluster memory sizes greater than 999 GB are now displayed in TB Fields that were missing from the PySpark and Hive job configuration tab ( Additional Python Files and Jar Files ) have been added The option to add preemptible nodes when creating a cluster is now in the "expander" at the bottom of the form Machine types with insufficient memory (less than 3.5 GB) are no longer displayed in the list of machine types (previously, selecting one of these small machine types would lead to an error from the backend The placeholder text in the Arguments field of the submit-job form has been corrected October 23, 2015 Feature GCP Console: Added support for adding, editing, and removing preemptible instances in clusters.

- User roles To get the permissions that you need to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: Dataproc Editor ( roles/dataproc.editor ) on the project Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) on the Compute Engine default service account Service account role To ensure that the Compute Engine default service account has the necessary permissions to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster, ask your administrator to grant the Dataproc Worker ( roles/dataproc.worker ) IAM role to the Compute Engine default service account on the project.
- You can use an identifier, such as 3 , 3.1 , or latest , or you can specify the full subminor version, such as 3.1-dataproc-5 . --staging-bucket : Delete this flag to have Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE create a staging bucket. --pools : This flag is used to specify a new or existing node pool that Managed Service for Apache Spark will create or use to perform the workload.
- "Managed Service for Apache Spark" is the new name for the product formerly known as "Dataproc on Compute Engine" (cluster deployment) and "Google Cloud Serverless for Apache Spark" (serverless deployment).
