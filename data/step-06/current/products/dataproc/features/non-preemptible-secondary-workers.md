- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 182
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Fixed Fixed the ability to delete jobs that fast-failed before some cluster and staging directories were created Fixed some remaining errors with vmem settings when using the distcp command Fixed a rare bug in which underlying Compute Engine issues could lead to VM instances failing to be deleted after the Cloud Dataproc cluster had been successfully deleted Hive command has been fixed Fixed error reporting when updating the number of workers (standard and preemptible) in a cluster Fixed some cases when Rate Limit Exceeded errors occurred The maximum cluster name length is now correctly 55 instead of 56 characters GCP Console Cluster list now includes a Created column, and the cluster configuration tab now includes a Created field, telling the creation time of the cluster In the cluster-create screen, cluster memory sizes greater than 999 GB are now displayed in TB Fields that were missing from the PySpark and Hive job configuration tab ( Additional Python Files and Jar Files ) have been added The option to add preemptible nodes when creating a cluster is now in the "expander" at the bottom of the form Machine types with insufficient memory (less than 3.5 GB) are no longer displayed in the list of machine types (previously, selecting one of these small machine types would lead to an error from the backend The placeholder text in the Arguments field of the submit-job form has been corrected October 23, 2015 Feature GCP Console: Added support for adding, editing, and removing preemptible instances in clusters.
- May 05, 2020 Feature Clusters can now be created with non-preemptible secondary workers.
- March 10, 2020 Change Added the following flags to gcloud dataproc clusters create and gcloud dataproc workflow-templates set-managed-cluster commands: --num-secondary-workers --num-secondary-worker-local-ssds --secondary-worker-boot-disk-size --secondary-worker-boot-disk-type --secondary-worker-accelerator Deprecated The following flags to gcloud dataproc clusters create and gcloud dataproc workflow-templates set-managed-cluster commands have been deprecated: --num-preemptible-workers --num-preemptible-worker-local-ssds --preemptible-worker-boot-disk-size --preemptible-worker-boot-disk-type --preemptible-worker-accelerator See the related change, above, for the new flags to use in place of these deprecated flags.

- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- For example, if you scale up the cluster, all new primary and secondary workers will have the new labels. gcloud Command You can specify one or more labels to be applied to a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster or job at creation or submit time using the Google Cloud CLI. gcloud dataproc clusters create args --labels environment=production,customer=acme gcloud dataproc jobs submit args --labels environment=production,customer=acme Once a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster or job has been created, you can update the labels associated with that resource using the Google Cloud CLI. gcloud dataproc clusters update args --update-labels environment=production,customer=acme gcloud dataproc jobs update args --update-labels environment=production,customer=acme Similarly, you can use the Google Cloud CLI to filter Managed Service for Apache Spark resources by label using a filter expression of the following format: labels.<key=value> . gcloud dataproc clusters list \ --region= region \ --filter="status.state=ACTIVE AND labels.environment=production" gcloud dataproc jobs list \ --region= region \ --filter="status.state=ACTIVE AND labels.customer=acme" See the clusters.list and jobs.list Dataproc API documentation for more information on writing a filter expression.
- Create and use Managed Service for Apache Spark labels Updating labels on clusters with secondary workers.
- A cluster can contain either preemptible workers or non-preemptible secondary workers, but not both.
- Label updates propagate to all preemptible secondary workers within 24 hours.

### "Class ClusterControllerAsyncClient (5.26.0) \_|\_ Python client libraries\

- Source ID: `site-python-reference`
- Final score: 140
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, to change the number of workers in a cluster to 5, the update mask parameter would be specified as config.worker config.num instances , and the PATCH request body would specify the new value, as follows: :: { "config":{ "workerConfig":{ "numInstances":"5" } } } Similarly, to change the number of preemptible workers in a cluster to 5, the update mask parameter would be config.secondary worker config.num instances , and the PATCH request body would be set as follows: :: { "config":{ "secondaryWorkerConfig":{ "numInstances":"5" } } } Note: Currently, only the following fields can be updated: .. raw:: html Mask Purpose labels Update labels config.worker config.num instances Resize primary worker group config.secondary worker config.num instances Resize secondary worker group config.autoscaling config.policy uri Use, stop using, or change autoscaling policies This corresponds to the update mask field on the request instance; if request is provided, this should not be set. retry google.api core.retry async.AsyncRetry Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried. timeout float The timeout for this request. metadata Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]] Key/value pairs which should be sent along with the request as metadata.
- It will require modifications to work: - It may require correct/in-range values for request initialization. - It may require specifying regional endpoints when creating the service client as shown in: https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/client options.html from google.cloud import dataproc v1 async def sample list clusters(): Create a client client = dataproc v1 .
- ListClustersRequest ( project id="project id value", region="region value", ) Make the request page result = client. list clusters (request=request) Handle the response async for response in page result: print(response) Parameters Name Description request Optional[Union[ google.cloud.dataproc v1.types.ListClustersRequest , dict]] The request object.
- Returns Type Description google.cloud.dataproc v1.services.cluster controller.pagers.ListClustersAsyncPager The list of all clusters in a project.
