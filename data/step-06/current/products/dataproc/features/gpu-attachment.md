Evidence snippets:
- Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster In Cloud Shell, create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster and attach it to the DPMS instance: gcloud dataproc clusters create ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --dataproc-metastore=projects/ ${ PROJECT } /locations/ ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } /services/ ${ DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --image-version=2.0 Specify the cluster image as version 2.0 , which is the latest version available as of June 2021.
- Create a new DPMS instance in the standby region: gcloud metastore services create ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --location= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --hive-metastore-version=3.1.2 Set the Hive data bucket as the default warehouse directory: gcloud metastore services update ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --location= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --update-hive-metastore-configs="hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=gs:// ${ PROJECT } -warehouse" Retrieve the path of the latest metadata backup: IMPORT DIR=gcloud storage ls gs:// ${ BACKUP BUCKET } sort -k 1 tail -1 IMPORT SQL=" ${ IMPORT DIR } hive.sql" echo ${ IMPORT SQL } Import the backed-up metadata into the new Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore instance: gcloud metastore services import gcs $ { DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ -- location = $ { DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ -- dump - type = mysql \ -- database - dump = $ { IMPORT SQL } \ -- import - id = import - $ ( date + "%Y-%m- %d -%H-%M-%S" ) Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster in the standby region (region B): gcloud dataproc clusters create ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --dataproc-metastore=projects/ ${ PROJECT } /locations/ ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } /services/ ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --region= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --image-version=2.0 Verify that the metadata was correctly imported: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --region ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --execute "select count( ) as num orders from orders;" The num orders output is most important to the tutorial.
- In Cloud Shell, export the metadata from the DPMS instance: gcloud metastore services export gcs $ { DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE } \ -- location =$ { DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ -- destination - folder = gs : //$ { BACKUP BUCKET } Retrieve the path of the latest metadata backup: IMPORT DIR=gcloud storage ls gs:// ${ BACKUP BUCKET } sort -k 1 tail -1 IMPORT SQL=" ${ IMPORT DIR } hive.sql" echo ${ IMPORT SQL } Import the metadata into the standby DPMS instance in the original region (region A): gcloud metastore services import gcs $ { DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ -- location = $ { DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ -- dump - type = mysql \ -- database - dump = $ { IMPORT SQL } \ -- import - id = import - $ ( date + "%Y-%m- %d -%H-%M-%S" ) Verify that the metadata was correctly imported: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --region ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --execute "select from completed orders limit 5;" The output includes the following: +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ completed orders.order id completed orders.order date completed orders.order customer id completed orders.order status +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ 3 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 12111 COMPLETE 5 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 11318 COMPLETE 6 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 7130 COMPLETE 7 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 4530 COMPLETE 15 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 2568 COMPLETE +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ The primary Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore and standby Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore have swapped roles again.
- Populate the metastore In Cloud Shell, update the sample retail.hql provided in this tutorial's repository with the name of the Hive data bucket: sed -i -- 's/ ${ WAREHOUSE BUCKET } /'" $WAREHOUSE BUCKET "'/g' retail.hql Run the queries contained in the retail.hql file to create the table definitions in the metastore: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster= ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --file=retail.hql Verify that the table definitions were correctly created: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster= ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --execute=" desc departments; desc categories; desc products; desc order items; desc orders; desc customers; select count( ) as num departments from departments; select count( ) as num categories from categories; select count( ) as num products from products; select count( ) as num order items from order items; select count( ) as num orders from orders; select count( ) as num customers from customers; " The output resembles the following: +------------------+------------+----------+ col name data type comment +------------------+------------+----------+ department id int department name string +------------------+------------+----------+ The output also contains the number of elements in each table—for example: +----------------+ num customers +----------------+ 12435 +----------------+ Failing over to the standby region This section provides the steps to failover from the primary region (region A) to the standby region (region B).

Evidence snippets:
- Create and attach a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster After you import your metadata into your Dataproc Metastore example-service service, create and attach a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster that uses the service as its Hive metastore.
- Enable the API Required Roles To get the permissions that you need to create a Dataproc Metastore and import a MySQL metastore, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: To create a service and import metadata: Dataproc Metastore Editor ( roles/metastore.editor ) on the project Dataproc Metastore Admin ( roles/metastore.admin ) on the project.
- Import metadata into a service Attach a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster or self-managed cluster Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- Your new service appears in the Service list. gcloud Run the following gcloud metastore services create command to create a service: gcloud metastore services create example-service \ --location= LOCATION Replace LOCATION with the Compute Engine region where you plan to create the service.

- Fixed Fixed the ability to delete jobs that fast-failed before some cluster and staging directories were created Fixed some remaining errors with vmem settings when using the distcp command Fixed a rare bug in which underlying Compute Engine issues could lead to VM instances failing to be deleted after the Cloud Dataproc cluster had been successfully deleted Hive command has been fixed Fixed error reporting when updating the number of workers (standard and preemptible) in a cluster Fixed some cases when Rate Limit Exceeded errors occurred The maximum cluster name length is now correctly 55 instead of 56 characters GCP Console Cluster list now includes a Created column, and the cluster configuration tab now includes a Created field, telling the creation time of the cluster In the cluster-create screen, cluster memory sizes greater than 999 GB are now displayed in TB Fields that were missing from the PySpark and Hive job configuration tab ( Additional Python Files and Jar Files ) have been added The option to add preemptible nodes when creating a cluster is now in the "expander" at the bottom of the form Machine types with insufficient memory (less than 3.5 GB) are no longer displayed in the list of machine types (previously, selecting one of these small machine types would lead to an error from the backend The placeholder text in the Arguments field of the submit-job form has been corrected October 23, 2015 Feature GCP Console: Added support for adding, editing, and removing preemptible instances in clusters.
