Evidence snippets:
- Create a new DPMS instance in the standby region: gcloud metastore services create ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --location= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --hive-metastore-version=3.1.2 Set the Hive data bucket as the default warehouse directory: gcloud metastore services update ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --location= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --update-hive-metastore-configs="hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=gs:// ${ PROJECT } -warehouse" Retrieve the path of the latest metadata backup: IMPORT DIR=gcloud storage ls gs:// ${ BACKUP BUCKET } sort -k 1 tail -1 IMPORT SQL=" ${ IMPORT DIR } hive.sql" echo ${ IMPORT SQL } Import the backed-up metadata into the new Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore instance: gcloud metastore services import gcs $ { DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ -- location = $ { DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ -- dump - type = mysql \ -- database - dump = $ { IMPORT SQL } \ -- import - id = import - $ ( date + "%Y-%m- %d -%H-%M-%S" ) Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster in the standby region (region B): gcloud dataproc clusters create ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --dataproc-metastore=projects/ ${ PROJECT } /locations/ ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } /services/ ${ DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ --region= ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --image-version=2.0 Verify that the metadata was correctly imported: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --region ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --execute "select count( ) as num orders from orders;" The num orders output is most important to the tutorial.
- Clone the tutorial's GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metastore-disaster-recovery.git Enable the following Google Cloud APIs: gcloud services enable dataproc.googleapis.com metastore.googleapis.com Set some environment variables: export PROJECT =$ ( gcloud info -- format = 'value(config.project)' ) export WAREHOUSE BUCKET =$ { PROJECT } - warehouse export BACKUP BUCKET =$ { PROJECT } - dpms - backups export DPMS PRIMARY REGION = us - central1 export DPMS STANDBY REGION = us - east1 export DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE = dpms1 export DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE = dpms2 export HADOOP PRIMARY = dataproc - cluster1 export HADOOP STANDBY = dataproc - cluster2 Creating storage for Hive data and Hive Metastore backups In this section, you create Cloud Storage buckets to host the Hive data and Hive Metastore backups.
- Set the Hive data bucket as the default warehouse directory: gcloud metastore services update ${ DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE } \ --location= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --update-hive-metastore-configs="hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=gs:// ${ PROJECT } - warehouse" This command can take several minutes to complete.
- In Cloud Shell, export the metadata from the DPMS instance: gcloud metastore services export gcs $ { DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE } \ -- location =$ { DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ -- destination - folder = gs : //$ { BACKUP BUCKET } Retrieve the path of the latest metadata backup: IMPORT DIR=gcloud storage ls gs:// ${ BACKUP BUCKET } sort -k 1 tail -1 IMPORT SQL=" ${ IMPORT DIR } hive.sql" echo ${ IMPORT SQL } Import the metadata into the standby DPMS instance in the original region (region A): gcloud metastore services import gcs $ { DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ -- location = $ { DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ -- dump - type = mysql \ -- database - dump = $ { IMPORT SQL } \ -- import - id = import - $ ( date + "%Y-%m- %d -%H-%M-%S" ) Verify that the metadata was correctly imported: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --region ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --execute "select from completed orders limit 5;" The output includes the following: +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ completed orders.order id completed orders.order date completed orders.order customer id completed orders.order status +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ 3 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 12111 COMPLETE 5 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 11318 COMPLETE 6 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 7130 COMPLETE 7 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 4530 COMPLETE 15 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 2568 COMPLETE +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ The primary Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore and standby Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore have swapped roles again.

Evidence snippets:
- December 16, 2015 Feature Cloud Dataproc clusters now have vim , git , and bash-completion installed by default The Cloud Dataproc API now has an official Maven artifact , Javadocs , and a downloadable .zip file GCP Console Properties can now be specified when submitting a job, and can be seen in the Configuration tab of a job A Clone button has been added that allows you to easily copy all information about a job to a new job submission form The left-side icons for Clusters and Jobs are now custom icons rather than generic ones An Image version field has been added to the bottom of the create cluster form that allows you to select a specific Cloud Dataproc image version when creating a cluster A VM Instances tab has been added on the cluster detail page, which you can use to display a list of all VMs in a cluster and easily SSH into the master node An Initialization Actions field has been added to the bottom of the create cluster form, which allows you to specify initialization actions when creating a cluster Paths to Cloud Storage buckets that are displayed in error messages are now clickable links.
- An inadvertent change in behavior has been identified for determining the location of the Spark eventlog directory when setting spark.hadoop.fs.defaultFS to any setting other than HDFS at Spark job-submission time in the following Cloud Dataproc June 2019 image versions: 1.1.113-debian9, 1.2.76-debian9, 1.3.36-debian9, 1.4.7-debian9, 1.3.36-ubuntu18, 1.4.7-ubuntu18 1.1.114-debian9, 1.2.77-debian9, 1.3.37-debian9, 1.4.8-debian9, 1.3.37-ubuntu18, 1.4.8-ubuntu18 Although the /user/spark/eventlog directory normally stays in HDFS, it began referring to the specified filesystem from spark.hadoop.fs.defaultFS in these image versions, and can result in the failure of Spark jobs with an error similar to "java.io.FileNotFoundException: File not found : /user/spark/eventlog".
- May 21, 2020 Feature You can now set core:fs.defaultFS to a location in Cloud Storage (for example, gs://bucket ) when creating a cluster to set Cloud Storage as the default filesystem.
- Fixed Forced distcp settings to match mapred-site.xml settings to provide additional fixes for the distcp command (see this related JIRA ) Ensured that workers created during an update do not join the cluster until after custom initialization actions are complete Ensured that workers always disconnect from a cluster when the Cloud Dataproc agent is shutdown Fixed a race condition in the API frontend that occurred when validating a request and marking cluster as updating Enhanced validation checks for quota, Cloud Dataproc image, and initialization actions when updating clusters Improved handling of jobs when the Cloud Dataproc agent is restarted GCP Console Allowed duplicate arguments when submitting a job Replaced generic Failed to load message with details about the cause of an error when an error occurs that is not related to Cloud Dataproc When a single jar file for a job is submitted, allowed it to be listed only in the Main class or jar field on the Submit a Job form, and no longer required it to also be listed in the Jar files field November 18, 2015 Change Core service improvements If set, a project's default zone setting is now used as the default value for the zone in the create-cluster form in the GCP Console.

Evidence snippets:
- Change the Hive warehouse directory To use your own Cloud Storage bucket with Dataproc Metastore, set a Hive Metastore configuration override to point to the new bucket location.
- When you use a Dataproc Metastore service, the default Hive warehouse directory is a Cloud Storage bucket.
- Artifacts Cloud Storage buckets The artifacts bucket stores your Dataproc Metastore artifacts, such as exported metadata and managed internal table data.
- Delete your bucket Deleting your Dataproc Metastore service doesn't automatically delete your Cloud Storage artifacts bucket.
