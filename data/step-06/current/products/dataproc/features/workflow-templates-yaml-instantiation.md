# Workflow Templates YAML instantiation

Product: Dataproc
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

The gcloud command can instantiate Dataproc workflow templates directly from a YAML file.

## Extended Definition

The gcloud command can instantiate Dataproc workflow templates directly from a YAML file.

## Evidence Summary

Evidence snippets:
- As part of this feature launch, users can import and export workflow templates directly from YAML files using the gcloud command-line tool.
- March 10, 2020 Change Added the following flags to gcloud dataproc clusters create and gcloud dataproc workflow-templates set-managed-cluster commands: --num-secondary-workers --num-secondary-worker-local-ssds --secondary-worker-boot-disk-size --secondary-worker-boot-disk-type --secondary-worker-accelerator Deprecated The following flags to gcloud dataproc clusters create and gcloud dataproc workflow-templates set-managed-cluster commands have been deprecated: --num-preemptible-workers --num-preemptible-worker-local-ssds --preemptible-worker-boot-disk-size --preemptible-worker-boot-disk-type --preemptible-worker-accelerator See the related change, above, for the new flags to use in place of these deprecated flags.
- June 08, 2018 Feature Google Cloud SDK 203.0.0 (2018-05-29) Changes include: Added gcloud beta dataproc workflow-templates instantiate-from-file to enable instantiation of workflow templates directly from a YAML file.
- January 27, 2016 Fixed Fixed two issues which would sometimes cause virtual machines to remain active after a cluster deletion request was submitted The Spark maxExecutors setting is now set to 10000 to avoid the AppMaster failing on jobs with many tasks Improved handling for aggressive job submission by making several changes to the Cloud Dataproc agent, including: Limiting the number of concurrent jobs so they are proportional to the memory of the master node Checking free memory before scheduling new jobs Rate limiting how many jobs can be scheduled per cycle Improved how HDFS capacity is calculated before commissioning or decommissioning nodes to prevent excessively long updates Feature Two new options have been added to the Cloud Dataproc gcloud command-line tool for adding tags and metadata to virtual machines used in Cloud Dataproc clusters.

Evidence snippets:
- Inline Workflows can be instantiated inline using the gcloud command with workflow template YAML files or by calling the Managed Service for Apache Spark InstantiateInline API (see Using inline Dataproc workflows ).
- Workflow Templates replace the steps involved in a typical flow, which include: creating the cluster submitting jobs polling deleting the cluster Workflow Templates use a single token to track progress from cluster creation to deletion, and automate error handling and recovery.
- Cluster selector A workflow template can specify an existing cluster on which to run workflow jobs by specifying one or more user labels previously attached to the cluster.
- The Managed Service for Apache Spark WorkflowTemplates API provides a flexible and easy-to-use mechanism for managing and executing workflows.

Evidence snippets:
- Update a cluster To change the number of workers in the cluster to five, run the following command: gcloud dataproc clusters update example-cluster \ --region= REGION \ --num-workers 5 The command output displays cluster details: workerConfig: ... instanceNames: - example-cluster-w-0 - example-cluster-w-1 - example-cluster-w-2 - example-cluster-w-3 - example-cluster-w-4 numInstances: 5 statusHistory: ... - detail: Add 3 workers.
- Submit a job To submit a sample Spark job that calculates a rough value for pi , run the following gcloud Managed Service for Apache Spark jobs submit spark command: gcloud dataproc jobs submit spark --cluster example-cluster \ --region= REGION \ --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \ --jars file:///usr/lib/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples.jar -- 1000 Notes: Replace the following: REGION : Specify the cluster region.
- To decrease the number of worker nodes to the original value of 2 , run the following command: gcloud dataproc clusters update example-cluster \ --region= REGION \ --num-workers 2 Clean up To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used on this page, follow these steps.
- This page shows you how to use the Google Cloud CLI gcloud command-line tool to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster, run a Apache Spark job in the cluster, then modify the number of workers in the cluster.
