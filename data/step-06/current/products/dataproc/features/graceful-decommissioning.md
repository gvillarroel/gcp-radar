# Graceful decommissioning

Product: Dataproc
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

Evidence snippets:
- January 27, 2016 Fixed Fixed two issues which would sometimes cause virtual machines to remain active after a cluster deletion request was submitted The Spark maxExecutors setting is now set to 10000 to avoid the AppMaster failing on jobs with many tasks Improved handling for aggressive job submission by making several changes to the Cloud Dataproc agent, including: Limiting the number of concurrent jobs so they are proportional to the memory of the master node Checking free memory before scheduling new jobs Rate limiting how many jobs can be scheduled per cycle Improved how HDFS capacity is calculated before commissioning or decommissioning nodes to prevent excessively long updates Feature Two new options have been added to the Cloud Dataproc gcloud command-line tool for adding tags and metadata to virtual machines used in Cloud Dataproc clusters.
- When using graceful decommissioning to remove secondary (preemptible) workers soon after scaling the secondary worker group, an error would occasionally occur with a error message similar to the following: "Secondary worker group cannot be modified outside of Cloud Dataproc.
- August 04, 2017 Change Apache Hadoop on Cloud Dataproc 1.2 has been updated to version 2.8.1 Feature Graceful decomissioning – Cloud Dataproc clusters running Cloud Dataproc 1.2 or later now support graceful YARN decommissioning .
- Fixed an uncommon issue in which a Cloud Dataproc agent restart during a small window of a cluster downscale operation could cause problems decommissioning data nodes.

- Execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers -Uri "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /clusters/ CLUSTER NAME nodeGroups/ Node GROUP ID " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /clusters/ CLUSTER NAME /nodeGroups/ NODE GROUP ID ", "roles": [ "DRIVER" ], "nodeGroupConfig": { "numInstances": 5, "imageUri": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/cloud-dataproc-ci/global/images/dataproc-2-0-deb10-...-rc01", "machineTypeUri": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /zones/ REGION -a/machineTypes/n1-standard-4", "diskConfig": { "bootDiskSizeGb": 1000, "bootDiskType": "pd-standard" }, "managedGroupConfig": { "instanceTemplateName": "dataproc-driver-pool-mcia3j656h2fy", "instanceGroupManagerName": "dataproc-driver-pool-mcia3j656h2fy" }, "minCpuPlatform": "AUTOMATIC", "preemptibility": "NON PREEMPTIBLE" } } Resize a driver node group You can use the gcloud dataproc node-groups resize command or the Managed Service for Apache Spark API to add or remove driver nodes from a cluster driver node group. gcloud gcloud dataproc node-groups resize NODE GROUP ID \ --cluster= CLUSTER NAME \ --region= REGION \ --size= SIZE Required flags: NODE GROUP ID : You can run gcloud dataproc clusters describe CLUSTER NAME to list the node group ID.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /clusters/ CLUSTER NAME /nodeGroups/ Node GROUP ID :resize" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "metadata": { "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.dataproc.v1.NodeGroupOperationMetadata", "nodeGroupId": " NODE GROUP ID ", "clusterUuid": " CLUSTER UUID ", "status": { "state": "PENDING", "innerState": "PENDING", "stateStartTime": "2022-12-01T23:34:53.064308Z" }, "operationType": "RESIZE", "description": "Scale "up or "down" a GCE node pool to SIZE nodes." } } Delete a driver node group cluster When you delete a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster , node groups associated with the cluster are deleted.
- Example: { "size": SIZE , "gracefulDecommissionTimeout": " TIMEOUT DURATION " } HTTP method and URL: POST https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /clusters/ CLUSTER NAME /nodeGroups/ Node GROUP ID :resize Request JSON body: { "size": SIZE , } To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
- Example: gcloud CLI NodeGroup scale up command: gcloud dataproc node-groups resize NODE GROUP ID \ --cluster= CLUSTER NAME \ --region= REGION \ --size=4 Example: gcloud CLI NodeGroup scale down command: gcloud dataproc node-groups resize NODE GROUP ID \ --cluster= CLUSTER NAME \ --region= REGION \ --size=1 \ --graceful-decommission-timeout="100s" REST Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: PROJECT ID : Required.

Evidence snippets:
- Delete the existing Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE virtual cluster if you will create a cluster that has the same name as the cluster it is updating (if you are replacing the original cluster). curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT}/regions/${REGION}/clusters/${CLUSTER}" Wait for the previous delete operation to finish, and then import the updated cluster configuration to create a new Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE virtual cluster with the updated settings. curl -i -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -d "@${CLUSTER}-config.json" "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT}/regions/${REGION}/clusters?alt=json" Console The Google Cloud console does not support recreating a Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE virtual cluster by importing an existing cluster's configuration.
- Wait for the previous delete operation to finish, and then import the updated cluster configuration to create a new Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE virtual cluster with the updated config settings. gcloud dataproc clusters import $CLUSTER \ --region=$REGION \ --source="${CLUSTER}-config.yaml" API Set environment variables: CLUSTER= existing Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE cluster name \ REGION= region Export the existing Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE cluster configuration to a YAML file. curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT}/regions/${REGION}/clusters/${CLUSTER}?alt=json" > "${CLUSTER}-config.json" Update the configuration.
- Recreate and update a Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE cluster gcloud Set environment variables: CLUSTER= existing Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE cluster name \ REGION= region Export the existing Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE cluster configuration to a YAML file. gcloud dataproc clusters export $CLUSTER \ --region=$REGION > "${CLUSTER}-config.yaml" Update the configuration.
- Sample jq command to remove kubernetesNamespace field: jq 'del(.virtualClusterConfig.kubernetesClusterConfig.kubernetesNamespace)' Make additional changes to update Managed Service for Apache Spark on GKE virtual cluster configuration settings, such as changing the Spark componentVersion .
