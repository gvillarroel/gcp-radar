- A custom image is saved in Cloud Compute Images , and is valid to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster for 365 days from its creation date (see Create a cluster with an expired custom image to use a custom image after its 365-day expiration date).
- The REST response lists additional information about the image, including the selfLink , which is the image URI. { ... "name": "my-custom-image", "selfLink": "projects/ PROJECT ID /global/images/ CUSTOM IMAGE NAME " , "sourceDisk": ..., ... } Create a cluster with a custom image create a cluster with using the gcloud CLI, the Managed Service for Apache Spark API, or the Google Cloud console. gcloud CLI Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster with a custom image using the dataproc clusters create command with the --image flag.
- Example: Google Cloud CLI cluster creation command : gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER NAME --image= CUSTOM IMAGE URI \ --optional-components= COMPONENT NAME \ ... other flags If the component name is not specified when you create the cluster, the optional component, including any custom OS packages and configs, will be deleted.

- Users can now create and save custom images that have their packages pre-installed.
- Fixed Forced distcp settings to match mapred-site.xml settings to provide additional fixes for the distcp command (see this related JIRA ) Ensured that workers created during an update do not join the cluster until after custom initialization actions are complete Ensured that workers always disconnect from a cluster when the Cloud Dataproc agent is shutdown Fixed a race condition in the API frontend that occurred when validating a request and marking cluster as updating Enhanced validation checks for quota, Cloud Dataproc image, and initialization actions when updating clusters Improved handling of jobs when the Cloud Dataproc agent is restarted GCP Console Allowed duplicate arguments when submitting a job Replaced generic Failed to load message with details about the cause of an error when an error occurs that is not related to Cloud Dataproc When a single jar file for a job is submitted, allowed it to be listed only in the Main class or jar field on the Submit a Job form, and no longer required it to also be listed in the Jar files field November 18, 2015 Change Core service improvements If set, a project's default zone setting is now used as the default value for the zone in the create-cluster form in the GCP Console.
- December 16, 2015 Feature Cloud Dataproc clusters now have vim , git , and bash-completion installed by default The Cloud Dataproc API now has an official Maven artifact , Javadocs , and a downloadable .zip file GCP Console Properties can now be specified when submitting a job, and can be seen in the Configuration tab of a job A Clone button has been added that allows you to easily copy all information about a job to a new job submission form The left-side icons for Clusters and Jobs are now custom icons rather than generic ones An Image version field has been added to the bottom of the create cluster form that allows you to select a specific Cloud Dataproc image version when creating a cluster A VM Instances tab has been added on the cluster detail page, which you can use to display a list of all VMs in a cluster and easily SSH into the master node An Initialization Actions field has been added to the bottom of the create cluster form, which allows you to specify initialization actions when creating a cluster Paths to Cloud Storage buckets that are displayed in error messages are now clickable links.
