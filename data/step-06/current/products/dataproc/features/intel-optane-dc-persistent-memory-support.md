Evidence snippets:
- November 15, 2019 Feature Allow creation of Dataproc master and worker VMs with Intel Optane DC Persistent memory using dataproc:dataproc.alpha.master.nvdimm.size.gb and dataproc:dataproc.alpha.master.nvdimm.size.gb properties.
- Fixed Fixed the ability to delete jobs that fast-failed before some cluster and staging directories were created Fixed some remaining errors with vmem settings when using the distcp command Fixed a rare bug in which underlying Compute Engine issues could lead to VM instances failing to be deleted after the Cloud Dataproc cluster had been successfully deleted Hive command has been fixed Fixed error reporting when updating the number of workers (standard and preemptible) in a cluster Fixed some cases when Rate Limit Exceeded errors occurred The maximum cluster name length is now correctly 55 instead of 56 characters GCP Console Cluster list now includes a Created column, and the cluster configuration tab now includes a Created field, telling the creation time of the cluster In the cluster-create screen, cluster memory sizes greater than 999 GB are now displayed in TB Fields that were missing from the PySpark and Hive job configuration tab ( Additional Python Files and Jar Files ) have been added The option to add preemptible nodes when creating a cluster is now in the "expander" at the bottom of the form Machine types with insufficient memory (less than 3.5 GB) are no longer displayed in the list of machine types (previously, selecting one of these small machine types would lead to an error from the backend The placeholder text in the Arguments field of the submit-job form has been corrected October 23, 2015 Feature GCP Console: Added support for adding, editing, and removing preemptible instances in clusters.
- October 31, 2022 Feature Dataproc Serverless for Spark now allows the customization of driver and executor memory using the following properties: spark.driver.memory spark.driver.memoryOverhead spark.executor.memory spark.executor.memoryOverhead Feature Dataproc Serverless for Spark now outputs approximate usage after a workload finishes that shows the approximate DCU and shuffle storage resource consumption by the workload.
- December 16, 2015 Feature Cloud Dataproc clusters now have vim , git , and bash-completion installed by default The Cloud Dataproc API now has an official Maven artifact , Javadocs , and a downloadable .zip file GCP Console Properties can now be specified when submitting a job, and can be seen in the Configuration tab of a job A Clone button has been added that allows you to easily copy all information about a job to a new job submission form The left-side icons for Clusters and Jobs are now custom icons rather than generic ones An Image version field has been added to the bottom of the create cluster form that allows you to select a specific Cloud Dataproc image version when creating a cluster A VM Instances tab has been added on the cluster detail page, which you can use to display a list of all VMs in a cluster and easily SSH into the master node An Initialization Actions field has been added to the bottom of the create cluster form, which allows you to specify initialization actions when creating a cluster Paths to Cloud Storage buckets that are displayed in error messages are now clickable links.

Evidence snippets:
- Clone the tutorial's GitHub repository: git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metastore-disaster-recovery.git Enable the following Google Cloud APIs: gcloud services enable dataproc.googleapis.com metastore.googleapis.com Set some environment variables: export PROJECT =$ ( gcloud info -- format = 'value(config.project)' ) export WAREHOUSE BUCKET =$ { PROJECT } - warehouse export BACKUP BUCKET =$ { PROJECT } - dpms - backups export DPMS PRIMARY REGION = us - central1 export DPMS STANDBY REGION = us - east1 export DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE = dpms1 export DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE = dpms2 export HADOOP PRIMARY = dataproc - cluster1 export HADOOP STANDBY = dataproc - cluster2 Creating storage for Hive data and Hive Metastore backups In this section, you create Cloud Storage buckets to host the Hive data and Hive Metastore backups.
- In Cloud Shell, export the metadata from the DPMS instance: gcloud metastore services export gcs $ { DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE } \ -- location =$ { DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ -- destination - folder = gs : //$ { BACKUP BUCKET } Retrieve the path of the latest metadata backup: IMPORT DIR=gcloud storage ls gs:// ${ BACKUP BUCKET } sort -k 1 tail -1 IMPORT SQL=" ${ IMPORT DIR } hive.sql" echo ${ IMPORT SQL } Import the metadata into the standby DPMS instance in the original region (region A): gcloud metastore services import gcs $ { DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE } \ -- location = $ { DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ -- dump - type = mysql \ -- database - dump = $ { IMPORT SQL } \ -- import - id = import - $ ( date + "%Y-%m- %d -%H-%M-%S" ) Verify that the metadata was correctly imported: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ HADOOP STANDBY } \ --region ${ DPMS STANDBY REGION } \ --execute "select from completed orders limit 5;" The output includes the following: +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ completed orders.order id completed orders.order date completed orders.order customer id completed orders.order status +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ 3 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 12111 COMPLETE 5 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 11318 COMPLETE 6 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 7130 COMPLETE 7 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 4530 COMPLETE 15 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 2568 COMPLETE +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ The primary Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore and standby Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore have swapped roles again.
- Populate the metastore In Cloud Shell, update the sample retail.hql provided in this tutorial's repository with the name of the Hive data bucket: sed -i -- 's/ ${ WAREHOUSE BUCKET } /'" $WAREHOUSE BUCKET "'/g' retail.hql Run the queries contained in the retail.hql file to create the table definitions in the metastore: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster= ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --file=retail.hql Verify that the table definitions were correctly created: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster= ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region= ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --execute=" desc departments; desc categories; desc products; desc order items; desc orders; desc customers; select count( ) as num departments from departments; select count( ) as num categories from categories; select count( ) as num products from products; select count( ) as num order items from order items; select count( ) as num orders from orders; select count( ) as num customers from customers; " The output resembles the following: +------------------+------------+----------+ col name data type comment +------------------+------------+----------+ department id int department name string +------------------+------------+----------+ The output also contains the number of elements in each table—for example: +----------------+ num customers +----------------+ 12435 +----------------+ Failing over to the standby region This section provides the steps to failover from the primary region (region A) to the standby region (region B).
- Update the environment variables based on these new roles: export DPMS PRIMARY REGION = us - east1 export DPMS STANDBY REGION = us - central1 ] export DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE = dpms2 export DPMS STANDBY INSTANCE = dpms1 export HADOOP PRIMARY = dataproc - cluster2 export HADOOP STANDBY = dataproc - cluster1 Verify that you can write to the new primary Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore in region B: gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ DPMS PRIMARY INSTANCE } \ --region ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --execute "create view completed orders as select from orders where order status = 'COMPLETE';" gcloud dataproc jobs submit hive \ --cluster ${ HADOOP PRIMARY } \ --region ${ DPMS PRIMARY REGION } \ --execute "select from completed orders limit 5;" The output contains the following: +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ completed orders.order id completed orders.order date completed orders.order customer id completed orders.order status +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ 3 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 12111 COMPLETE 5 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 11318 COMPLETE 6 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 7130 COMPLETE 7 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 4530 COMPLETE 15 2013-07-25 00:00:00.0 2568 COMPLETE +----------------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+ The failover is now complete.
