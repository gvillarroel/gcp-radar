Evidence snippets:
- Fixed Fixed the ability to delete jobs that fast-failed before some cluster and staging directories were created Fixed some remaining errors with vmem settings when using the distcp command Fixed a rare bug in which underlying Compute Engine issues could lead to VM instances failing to be deleted after the Cloud Dataproc cluster had been successfully deleted Hive command has been fixed Fixed error reporting when updating the number of workers (standard and preemptible) in a cluster Fixed some cases when Rate Limit Exceeded errors occurred The maximum cluster name length is now correctly 55 instead of 56 characters GCP Console Cluster list now includes a Created column, and the cluster configuration tab now includes a Created field, telling the creation time of the cluster In the cluster-create screen, cluster memory sizes greater than 999 GB are now displayed in TB Fields that were missing from the PySpark and Hive job configuration tab ( Additional Python Files and Jar Files ) have been added The option to add preemptible nodes when creating a cluster is now in the "expander" at the bottom of the form Machine types with insufficient memory (less than 3.5 GB) are no longer displayed in the list of machine types (previously, selecting one of these small machine types would lead to an error from the backend The placeholder text in the Arguments field of the submit-job form has been corrected October 23, 2015 Feature GCP Console: Added support for adding, editing, and removing preemptible instances in clusters.
- January 27, 2016 Fixed Fixed two issues which would sometimes cause virtual machines to remain active after a cluster deletion request was submitted The Spark maxExecutors setting is now set to 10000 to avoid the AppMaster failing on jobs with many tasks Improved handling for aggressive job submission by making several changes to the Cloud Dataproc agent, including: Limiting the number of concurrent jobs so they are proportional to the memory of the master node Checking free memory before scheduling new jobs Rate limiting how many jobs can be scheduled per cycle Improved how HDFS capacity is calculated before commissioning or decommissioning nodes to prevent excessively long updates Feature Two new options have been added to the Cloud Dataproc gcloud command-line tool for adding tags and metadata to virtual machines used in Cloud Dataproc clusters.
- Fixed Forced distcp settings to match mapred-site.xml settings to provide additional fixes for the distcp command (see this related JIRA ) Ensured that workers created during an update do not join the cluster until after custom initialization actions are complete Ensured that workers always disconnect from a cluster when the Cloud Dataproc agent is shutdown Fixed a race condition in the API frontend that occurred when validating a request and marking cluster as updating Enhanced validation checks for quota, Cloud Dataproc image, and initialization actions when updating clusters Improved handling of jobs when the Cloud Dataproc agent is restarted GCP Console Allowed duplicate arguments when submitting a job Replaced generic Failed to load message with details about the cause of an error when an error occurs that is not related to Cloud Dataproc When a single jar file for a job is submitted, allowed it to be listed only in the Main class or jar field on the Submit a Job form, and no longer required it to also be listed in the Jar files field November 18, 2015 Change Core service improvements If set, a project's default zone setting is now used as the default value for the zone in the create-cluster form in the GCP Console.
- December 11, 2023 Announcement Announcing the GA release of Dataproc on Compute Engine image version 2.2 : 2.2.0-debian12, 2.2.0-rocky9, 2.2.0-ubuntu22 The 2.2.0 release includes the following components: Debian-12 / Ubuntu-2204 / RockyLinux 9 Apache Hadoop 3.3.6 Apache Spark 3.5.0 Spark-BigQuery Connector 0.34.0 Cloud Storage Connector 3.0.0 Trino 432 Apache Flink 1.17.0 Apache Ranger 2.4.0 Apache Solr 9.2.1 R 4.2 Hue 4.11.0 JupyterLab Notebook 3.6 Change Monitoring-agent-defaults metrics are not available in Dataproc on Compute Engine image version 2.2 clusters unless the Ops Agent is installed.

Evidence snippets:
- Create a cluster with an ARM machine type . gcloud To create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster on the command line, run the gcloud dataproc clusters create command locally in a terminal window or in Cloud Shell . gcloud dataproc clusters create CLUSTER NAME \ --region= REGION The command creates a cluster with default Managed Service for Apache Spark service settings for your master and worker virtual machine instances, disk sizes and types, network type, region and zone where your cluster is deployed, and other cluster settings.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT /regions/ REGION /clusters" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "name": "projects/ PROJECT /regions/ REGION /operations/b5706e31......", "metadata": { "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.dataproc.v1.ClusterOperationMetadata", "clusterName": " CLUSTER NAME ", "clusterUuid": "5fe882b2-...", "status": { "state": "PENDING", "innerState": "PENDING", "stateStartTime": "2019-11-21T00:37:56.220Z" }, "operationType": "CREATE", "description": "Create cluster with 2 workers", "warnings": [ "For PD-Standard without local SSDs, we strongly recommend provisioning 1TB ..."" ] } } Note: You can click the Equivalent REST or command line links at the bottom of the left panel of the Managed Service for Apache Spark Google Cloud console Create a cluster page to have the Console construct an equivalent API REST request or gcloud tool command to use in your code or from the command line to create a cluster.
- See the gcloud dataproc clusters create command for information on using command line flags to customize cluster settings.
- HTTP method and URL: POST https://dataproc.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT /regions/ REGION /clusters Request JSON body: { "project id":" PROJECT ", "cluster name":" CLUSTER NAME ", "config":{ "master config":{ "num instances":1, "machine type uri":"n1-standard-2", "image uri":"" }, "softwareConfig": { "imageVersion": "", "properties": {}, "optionalComponents": [] }, "worker config":{ "num instances":2, "machine type uri":"n1-standard-2", "image uri":"" }, "gce cluster config":{ "zone uri":" ZONE " } } } To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
