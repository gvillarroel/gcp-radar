- You can use either of both of the following flags to collect specific job driver, Spark event, YARN application, and Sparklens output logs: --job-ids : A comma-separated list of job IDs --yarn-application-ids : A comma-separated list of YARN application IDs YARN log aggregation must be enabled ( yarn.log-aggregation-enable=true ) for the collection of YARN application logs.
- Note: If you enable uniform bucket-level access on the cluster temp bucket, all of the temp bucket contents, including collected checkpoint diagnostic data and ephemeral data, such as MapReduce job history files, aggregated YARN logs, and Spark event logs, is shared with Google Cloud support.

- Note: The following cluster property settings are also required to enable job driver logs in Logging, and are set by default when a cluster is created: dataproc:dataproc.logging.stackdriver.enable=true and dataproc:jobs.file-backed-output.enable=true dataproc:dataproc.logging.stackdriver.job.yarn.container.enable true or false false Must be set at cluster creation time.
- Spark driver logs The following tables list the effect of different property settings on the destination of Spark driver logs for jobs not submitted through the Managed Service for Apache Spark jobs API. spark: spark.submit.deployMode Driver Output client Streamed to client Not in Cloud Storage Not in Logging cluster Not streamed to client Not in Cloud Storage In Logging yarn-userlogs under the cluster resource Spark executor logs When Spark jobs are not submitted through the Managed Service for Apache Spark jobs API, executor logs are in Logging yarn-userlogs under the cluster resource.
- The Spark driver runs the job on the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster in Spark client or cluster mode : client mode: the Spark driver runs the job in the spark-submit process, and Spark logs are sent to the Managed Service for Apache Spark job driver. cluster mode: the Spark driver runs the job in a YARN container.

- The following command uses cluster labels to filter the returned log entries. gcloud logging read <<'EOF' "resource.type=cloud dataproc cluster resource.labels.region= cluster-region resource.labels.cluster name= cluster-name resource.labels.cluster uuid= cluster-uuid " EOF Sample output (partial): jsonPayload: class: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.ResourceTrackerService filename: hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager-cluster-name-m.log ... logName: projects/project-id/logs/hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager --- jsonPayload: class: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.ResourceTrackerService filename: hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager-component-gateway-cluster-m.log ... logName: projects/project-id/logs/hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager Run gcloud dataproc clusters describe cluster-name --region= region to list cluster labels that you can use to filter logging results.
- Example: Job driver log after running a Logs Explorer query with the following selections: Resource: Cloud Dataproc Job Log name: dataproc.job.driver Example: YARN container log after running a Logs Explorer query with the following selections: Resource: Cloud Dataproc Job Log name: dataproc.job.yarn.container gcloud You can read job log entries using the gcloud logging read command.
