- Enable sharing after cluster creation : You can enable sharing checkpoint data with Google Cloud support after cluster creation by providing read access to checkpoint data to the service account used by the Google Cloud support, as follows: If uniform bucket-level access is enabled on the temp bucket, add IAM policy binding: gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs:// TEMP BUCKET \ --member=serviceAccount:cloud-diagnose@cloud-dataproc.iam.gserviceaccount.com \ --role=roles/storage.objectViewer If object-level access control is enabled on the temp bucket, run the following command to share checkpoint diagnostic data: gcloud storage objects update \ gs:// TEMP BUCKET /google-cloud-dataproc-diagnostic/ CLUSTER UUID \ --add-acl-grant=entity=user-cloud-diagnose@cloud-dataproc.iam.gserviceaccount.com,role=READER --recursive Disable checkpoint diagnostic data collection To disable the collection of checkpoint diagnostic data on a cluster, set dataproc:diagnostic.capture.enabled=false when you create the cluster.
- Checkpoint data location Managed Service for Apache Spark saves checkpoint diagnostic data in the cluster temp bucket in Cloud Storage in the following folder (the checkpoint diagnostic data folder ): gs:// TEMP BUCKET /google-cloud-dataproc-diagnostic/ CLUSTER UUID You can run the gcloud dataproc clusters describe CLUSTER NAME command to list the cluster temp bucket The default cluster temp bucket has a TTL retention period of 90 days.
- As an alternative to running the diagnose command, you can use SSH to connect to the cluster then run the script locally on the master node. gcloud compute ssh HOSTNAME gcloud storage cp gs://dataproc-diagnostic-scripts/diagnostic-script.sh . sudo bash diagnostic-script.sh The diagnostic archive tar file is saved in a local directory.

Evidence snippets:
- User roles To get the permissions that you need to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: Dataproc Editor ( roles/dataproc.editor ) on the project Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) on the Compute Engine default service account Service account role To ensure that the Compute Engine default service account has the necessary permissions to create a Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster, ask your administrator to grant the Dataproc Worker ( roles/dataproc.worker ) IAM role to the Compute Engine default service account on the project.
- "Managed Service for Apache Spark" is the new name for the product formerly known as "Dataproc on Compute Engine" (cluster deployment) and "Google Cloud Serverless for Apache Spark" (serverless deployment).
- Run the command: gcloud dataproc clusters gke create ${DP CLUSTER} \ --region=${REGION} \ --gke-cluster=${GKE CLUSTER} \ --spark-engine-version=latest \ --staging-bucket=${BUCKET} \ --pools="name=${DP POOLNAME},roles=default" \ --setup-workload-identity \ --history-server-cluster=${PHS CLUSTER} Notes: --spark-engine-version : The Spark image version used on the Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.
- It's a virtual resource, and unlike a Managed Service for Apache Spark on Compute Engine cluster, does not include separate Managed Service for Apache Spark master and worker VMs.
