Evidence snippets:
- Deprecated Image 1.5 and 2.0 Agnets no longer publish a /has run before sentinel file.
- Use any of the following strategies as a workaround: Run the following command manually before submitting jobs: hdfs dfs -mkdir -p <filesystem base/bucket>/user/spark/eventlog Add the following Spark properties to Spark jobs to override defaultFS : spark.eventLog.dir=hdfs:///user/spark/eventlog,spark.history.fs.logDirectory=hdfs:///user/spark/eventlog Temporarily pin to the immediately prior image version numbers until image versions newer than those listed above are available.
- Fixed Fixed the ability to delete jobs that fast-failed before some cluster and staging directories were created Fixed some remaining errors with vmem settings when using the distcp command Fixed a rare bug in which underlying Compute Engine issues could lead to VM instances failing to be deleted after the Cloud Dataproc cluster had been successfully deleted Hive command has been fixed Fixed error reporting when updating the number of workers (standard and preemptible) in a cluster Fixed some cases when Rate Limit Exceeded errors occurred The maximum cluster name length is now correctly 55 instead of 56 characters GCP Console Cluster list now includes a Created column, and the cluster configuration tab now includes a Created field, telling the creation time of the cluster In the cluster-create screen, cluster memory sizes greater than 999 GB are now displayed in TB Fields that were missing from the PySpark and Hive job configuration tab ( Additional Python Files and Jar Files ) have been added The option to add preemptible nodes when creating a cluster is now in the "expander" at the bottom of the form Machine types with insufficient memory (less than 3.5 GB) are no longer displayed in the list of machine types (previously, selecting one of these small machine types would lead to an error from the backend The placeholder text in the Arguments field of the submit-job form has been corrected October 23, 2015 Feature GCP Console: Added support for adding, editing, and removing preemptible instances in clusters.
- Fixed Forced distcp settings to match mapred-site.xml settings to provide additional fixes for the distcp command (see this related JIRA ) Ensured that workers created during an update do not join the cluster until after custom initialization actions are complete Ensured that workers always disconnect from a cluster when the Cloud Dataproc agent is shutdown Fixed a race condition in the API frontend that occurred when validating a request and marking cluster as updating Enhanced validation checks for quota, Cloud Dataproc image, and initialization actions when updating clusters Improved handling of jobs when the Cloud Dataproc agent is restarted GCP Console Allowed duplicate arguments when submitting a job Replaced generic Failed to load message with details about the cause of an error when an error occurs that is not related to Cloud Dataproc When a single jar file for a job is submitted, allowed it to be listed only in the Main class or jar field on the Submit a Job form, and no longer required it to also be listed in the Jar files field November 18, 2015 Change Core service improvements If set, a project's default zone setting is now used as the default value for the zone in the create-cluster form in the GCP Console.

### "Create a Managed Service for Apache Spark custom image \_|\_ Google Cloud\

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 126
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Full URI: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/beta/projects/ PROJECT ID /global/images/family/ CUSTOM IMAGE FAMILY NAME/var> Partial URI: projects/ PROJECT ID /global/images/family/ CUSTOM IMAGE FAMILY NAME Find the custom image URI Google Cloud CLI Run the following command to list the names of your custom images. gcloud compute images list Pass the name of your custom image to the following command to list the URI ( selfLink ) of your custom image. gcloud compute images describe custom-image-name Output snippet: ... name: CUSTOM IMAGE NAME selfLink: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /global/images/ CUSTOM IMAGE NAME ...
- You can avoid this issue by including the following command in your customization script to clear cached credentials. rm -r /root/.gsutil /root/.config/gcloud --zone : the Compute Engine zone where generate custom image.py will create a temporary VM to use to create your custom image. --gcs-bucket : a URI, in the format gs:// BUCKET NAME , that points to your Cloud Storage bucket . generate custom image.py writes log files to this bucket.
- Then, run the generate custom image.py script to have Managed Service for Apache Spark generate and save your custom image. python3 generate custom image.py \ --image-name= CUSTOM IMAGE NAME \ [--family= CUSTOM IMAGE FAMILY NAME ] \ --dataproc-version= IMAGE VERSION \ --customization-script= LOCAL PATH \ --zone= ZONE \ --gcs-bucket= gs:// BUCKET NAME \ [--no-smoke-test] Required flags --image-name : the output name for your custom image.
- How it works The generate custom image.py program launches a temporary Compute Engine VM instance with the specified Managed Service for Apache Spark base image, then runs the customization script inside the VM instance to install custom packages and or update configurations.

Evidence snippets:
- Base Spark images Managed Service for Apache Spark supports the following base Spark container images: Spark 3.5 : ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-dataproc/spark/dataproc 2.2 Sample custom container image build Sample Dockerfile FROM us - central1 - docker . pkg . dev / cloud - dataproc / spark / dataproc 2 .0 : latest Change to root temporarily so that it has permissions to create dirs and copy files.
- USER spark Build the container image Run the following commands in the Dockerfile directory Set image (example: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/spark/spark-test-image:latest ) and change to build directory.
- Create a Python example file. cat >test util.py <<'EOF' def hello(name): print("hello {}".format(name)) def read lines(path): with open(path) as f: return f.readlines() EOF Create an example init script. cat >init-script.sh <<EOF echo "hello world" >/tmp/init-script.out EOF Build and push the image. docker build -t "${IMAGE}" . && docker push "${IMAGE}" Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
