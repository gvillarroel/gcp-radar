- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-required-4`
- Final score: 120
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Active Directory endpoints and TLS connections If you're using Windows Authentication and you want to establish a TLS connection without trusting the server certificate, you must rotate the certificates after Windows Authentication is enabled on the instance.
- If your Managed Microsoft AD is in a different project, AD PROJECT ID should be the one containing the Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory instance, while the service account's SQL PROJECT NUMBER should be the one containing the SQL Server instance: gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding AD PROJECT ID \ --member = serviceAccount:service- SQL PROJECT NUMBER @gcp-sa-cloud-sql.iam.gserviceaccount.com \ --role = roles/managedidentities.sqlintegrator Also see gcloud beta services identity create .
- MySQL PostgreSQL SQL Server You can integrate Cloud SQL for SQL Server with Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory (also called Managed Microsoft AD).
- SQL Server logins based on Active Directory users and groups cannot be managed from the Google Cloud console.

Evidence snippets:
- Execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT NAME " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "compute#forwardingRule", "id": " ENDPOINT ID ", "creationTimestamp": "2024-05-09T12:03:21.383-07:00", "name": " ENDPOINT NAME ", "region": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME ", "IPAddress": " IP ADDRESS ", "target": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME /serviceAttachments/ SERVICE ATTACHMENT NAME ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT NAME ", "network": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /global/networks/default", "serviceDirectoryRegistrations": [ { "namespace": "goog-psc-default" } ], "networkTier": "PREMIUM", "labelFingerprint": " LABEL FINGERPRINT ID ", "fingerprint": " FINGERPRINT ID ", "pscConnectionId": " CONNECTION ID ", "pscConnectionStatus": "ACCEPTED", "allowPscGlobalAccess": true } Verify that the status of the endpoint is ACCEPTED .
- To do this, run the following command: EXEC master.dbo.sp addlinkedserver @server = N ' LINKED SERVER NAME ' , @srvproduct = N '' , @provider = N 'MSOLEDBSQL' , @datasrc = N ' TARGET SERVER ID ' , @provstr = N 'Encrypt=yes;TrustServerCertificate=yes;User ID= USER ID ' Replace the following: LINKED SERVER NAME with the name of the linked server.
- Verify that the DNS names that you want to add to the server certificate of a Cloud SQL instance meet the following criteria: They don't have wildcard characters.
- There are other factors beside your workload that can impact memory usage, such as the number of active connections and internal overhead processes.
