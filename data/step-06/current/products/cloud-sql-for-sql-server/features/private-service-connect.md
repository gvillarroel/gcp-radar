Evidence snippets:
- You can use Private Service Connect for the following purposes: Connect to a Cloud SQL instance from multiple VPC networks that belong to different groups, teams, projects, or organizations Connect to either a primary instance or any of its read replicas Private Service Connect endpoint You can use Private Service Connect endpoints to access Cloud SQL instances privately from your consumer VPC networks.
- For ease of use, we recommend connecting to your Cloud SQL instances using Private Service Connect endpoints.
- Private Service Connect outbound connections You can attach a Private Service Connect interface to your existing Cloud SQL Private Service Connect-enabled instances using a network attachment to allow your Cloud SQL instance to make outbound connections to your network.
- DNS names and records For instances with Private Service Connect enabled, we recommend that you use the DNS name because different networks can connect to the same instance and Private Service Connect endpoints in each network might have different IP addresses.

Evidence snippets:
- Remove networking options from an instance Cloud SQL supports the removal of the following networking options from an instance: Public IP from an instance with both private services access and public IP Public IP from an instance with public IP, private services access, and Private Service Connect Private Service Connect from an instance with both Private Service Connect and private services access Private Service Connect from an instance with Private Service Connect, private services access, and public IP Enable networking options for an instance You can enable Cloud SQL supports enabling the following connection options for instances: Private services access on an instance with public IP only Private Service Connect on an instance with private services access only Private Service Connect on an instance with both private services access and public IP Public IP on an instance with private services access only Limitations You can't create an instance with both a public IP address and Private Service Connect.
