Evidence snippets:
- For ease of use, we recommend connecting to your Cloud SQL instances using Private Service Connect endpoints.
- You can use Private Service Connect for the following purposes: Connect to a Cloud SQL instance from multiple VPC networks that belong to different groups, teams, projects, or organizations Connect to either a primary instance or any of its read replicas Private Service Connect endpoint You can use Private Service Connect endpoints to access Cloud SQL instances privately from your consumer VPC networks.
- To use Private Service Connect backends, you must setup the following resources for each serving port on which you want to access a given Cloud SQL instance: Private Service Connect Network Endpoint Group (NEG) , which must reference the service attachment and a serving port of the Cloud SQL instance.
- Private Service Connect outbound connections You can attach a Private Service Connect interface to your existing Cloud SQL Private Service Connect-enabled instances using a network attachment to allow your Cloud SQL instance to make outbound connections to your network.
