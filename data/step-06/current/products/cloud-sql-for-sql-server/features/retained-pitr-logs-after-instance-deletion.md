# Retained PITR logs after instance deletion

Product: Cloud SQL for SQL Server
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Retained PITR logs after instance deletion preserve recovery logs for a defined period so deleted instances can be restored to a specific point in time.

- Final score: 230
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Since instance names can be reused after an instance is deleted in Cloud SQL, retained PITR logs can be identified in Google Cloud with the following fields: instance deletion time log retention days These fields allow you to identify if a PITR log belongs to a deleted instance.
- When enabled, PITR logs are retained after you delete the instance.
- If you upgrade a Cloud SQL Enterprise edition instance after May 31, 2024 that stores transaction logs for PITR on disk to Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition, then the upgrade process switches the storage location of the transaction logs used for PITR to Cloud Storage for you.
- For example, if your Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition instance has PITR retention set to 14 days, then the latest PITR log will be deleted 14 days after instance deletion.
