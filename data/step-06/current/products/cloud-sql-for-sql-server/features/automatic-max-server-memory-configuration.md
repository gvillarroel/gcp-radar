Evidence snippets:
- Feature Cloud SQL configures the max server memory (mb) flag based on the instance size automatically by limiting the amount of memory that SQL Server can allocate for its internal pools.
- February 18, 2026 Change After March 17, 2026, when you enable the Cloud SQL Admin API ( sqladmin.googleapis.com ), the Cloud SQL remote MCP server is enabled automatically.
- August 22, 2022 Change Cloud SQL may set a value for the max server memory (mb) flag on instances, based on Microsoft's recommended values .
- You can manually set a value for this flag, or omit the flag and let Cloud SQL manage memory limits for you automatically.

Evidence snippets:
- Delete the changes To delete your changes, do the following: To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the deletion protection argument to false . deletion protection = "false" Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes at the prompt: terraform apply Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes at the prompt: terraform destroy REST v1 To set a flag for an existing database: Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: project-id : The project ID instance-id : The instance ID HTTP method and URL: PATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id Request JSON body: { "settings": { "databaseFlags": [ { "name": " flag name ", "value": " flag value " } ] } } To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
- Using the max degree of parallelism (MAXDOP) flag, you can control the number of threads at three levels: Instance level, using database flags Database scope, using TSQL Query level, using query hints Note that if the instance is resized, then the flag value remains unchanged. max server memory (mb) The max server memory (mb) flag limits the amount of memory that Cloud SQL can allocate for its internal pools.
- If you must manually manage this value, as a general recommendation, set the max server memory (mb) value to roughly 80% of available memory to help prevent SQL Server from consuming all memory.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method PATCH -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: Response { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id ", "status": "PENDING", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2020-01-21T22:43:37.981Z", "operationType": "UPDATE", "name": " operation-id ", "targetId": " instance-id ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ project-id /operations/ operation-id ", "targetProject": " project-id " } REST v1beta4 To clear all flags for an existing instance: Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: project-id : The project ID instance-id : The instance ID HTTP method and URL: PATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id Request JSON body: { "settings": { "databaseFlags": [] } } To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
