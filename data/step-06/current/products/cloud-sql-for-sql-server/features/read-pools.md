- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-required-4`
- Final score: 246
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- When you want the read pool to scale in or scale out, applications that were previously connected to this single read endpoint don't need to be reconfigured, even though you can create new read pool nodes in the read pool or delete previous ones.
- Access a read pool through a single read endpoint The read pool is accessible through a single read endpoint with an immutable IP address.
- MySQL PostgreSQL SQL Server Cloud SQL read pools support load balancing for your large read workloads.
- In addition to operations that aren't supported on read replicas, the following operations aren't supported on read pools: Enable and disable replication Customer-managed Active Directory Managed Microsoft AD Promote replica Restart Import Export Failover Re-encrypt Clone SSL/TLS certificates with shared CA or customer-managed CA can't be used with a read pool.

- Note: Cloud SQL generates a write endpoint automatically for your Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition instance if you do the following: If you haven't already enabled the Cloud DNS API, enable the Cloud DNS API for your Google Cloud project.
- With Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition, you choose from two machine families: Performance-optimized : offers a balanced price performance for various SQL Server workloads with a memory-to-compute ratio of 1 vCPU:8 GB RAM.
- Performance-optimized machine family This machine family offers balanced price-performance for a wide variety of SQL Server workloads with a memory to compute ratio of 1 vCPU:8 GB RAM.
