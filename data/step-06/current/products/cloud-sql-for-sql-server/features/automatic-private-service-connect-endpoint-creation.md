- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-required-4`
- Final score: 209
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Create a Cloud SQL instance with Private Service Connect enabled for the instance and configure the instance to create an endpoint automatically.
- As a result, you can provision Private Service Connect endpoints automatically.
- Service attachment When you create a Cloud SQL instance and configure the instance to use Private Service Connect, Cloud SQL creates a service attachment for the instance automatically.
- To have Cloud SQL create the endpoint automatically, do the following: Create a service connection policy in your VPC networks.

Evidence snippets:
- Check the endpoint's status. gcloud To check the status, use the gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe command. gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe ENDPOINT NAME \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION NAME \ grep pscConnectionStatus Make the following replacements: ENDPOINT NAME : the name of the endpoint PROJECT ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the endpoint REGION NAME : the region name for the endpoint REST Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: PROJECT ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the Private Service Connect endpoint REGION NAME : the name of the region ENDPOINT NAME : the name of the endpoint HTTP method and URL: GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT NAME To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
- Execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT NAME " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "compute#forwardingRule", "id": " ENDPOINT ID ", "creationTimestamp": "2024-05-09T12:03:21.383-07:00", "name": " ENDPOINT NAME ", "region": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME ", "IPAddress": " IP ADDRESS ", "target": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME /serviceAttachments/ SERVICE ATTACHMENT NAME ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT NAME ", "network": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /global/networks/default", "serviceDirectoryRegistrations": [ { "namespace": "goog-psc-default" } ], "networkTier": "PREMIUM", "labelFingerprint": " LABEL FINGERPRINT ID ", "fingerprint": " FINGERPRINT ID ", "pscConnectionId": " CONNECTION ID ", "pscConnectionStatus": "ACCEPTED", "allowPscGlobalAccess": true } Verify that the status of the endpoint is ACCEPTED .
- ERROR: (gcloud.compute.forwarding-rules.create) Could not fetch resource: The resource 'projects/PROJECT ID/regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNET NAME' was not found This error message can occur when reserving a static internal IP address for the Private Service Connect endpoint.
- ERROR: (gcloud.compute.forwarding-rules.create) Could not fetch resource: - The resource 'projects/PROJECT ID/global/networks/NETWORK NAME' was not found This error message can occur when you create a Private Service Connect endpoint manually.
