Evidence snippets:
- The connection propagation feature in NCC benefits the following use case for Private Service Connect deployments: You can use a common services VPC network to create multiple Private Service Connect endpoints.
- For example, if you have three VPC networks that have to connect to your instance, then you must create three Private Service Connect endpoints—one endpoint for each VPC network.
- For these projects, you can create Private Service Connect endpoints for each instance.
- You can use Private Service Connect for the following purposes: Connect to a Cloud SQL instance from multiple VPC networks that belong to different groups, teams, projects, or organizations Connect to either a primary instance or any of its read replicas Private Service Connect endpoint You can use Private Service Connect endpoints to access Cloud SQL instances privately from your consumer VPC networks.

Evidence snippets:
- Set the password for the user: gcloud sql users set-password sqlserver no-host --instance =[ INSTANCE NAME ] \ --password =[ PASSWORD ] Terraform To create an instance, use a Terraform resource . resource "google sql database instance" "default" { name = "sqlserver-instance" region = "us-central1" database version = "SQLSERVER 2019 STANDARD" root password = "INSERT-PASSWORD-HERE" settings { tier = "db-custom-2-7680" } } Apply the changes To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.
- Connectivity Private IP --network --no-assign-ip (optional) --allocated-ip-range-name (optional) --enable-google-private-path (optional) --network : Specifies the name of the VPC network you want to use for this instance.
- Connections Private IP Adds a private IP address for your instance.
- Execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#instance", "state": "RUNNABLE", "databaseVersion": " DATABASE VERSION ", "settings": { "authorizedGaeApplications": [], "tier": " MACHINE TYPE ", "kind": "sql#settings", "pricingPlan": "PER USE", "replicationType": "SYNCHRONOUS", "activationPolicy": "ALWAYS", "ipConfiguration": { "authorizedNetworks": [], "ipv4Enabled": true }, "locationPreference": { "zone": " ZONE ", "kind": "sql#locationPreference" }, "dataDiskType": "PD SSD", "backupConfiguration": { "startTime": "19:00", "kind": "sql#backupConfiguration", "enabled": true }, "settingsVersion": "1", "dataDiskSizeGb": "10" }, "etag": "--redacted--", "ipAddresses": [ { "type": "PRIMARY", " ipAddress ": " 10.0.0.1 " } ], "serverCaCert": { ... }, "instanceType": "CLOUD SQL INSTANCE", "project": " PROJECT ID ", "serviceAccountEmailAddress": "redacted@gcp-sa-cloud-sql.iam.gserviceaccount.com", "backendType": " BACKEND TYPE ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID ", "connectionName": " PROJECT ID:REGION:INSTANCE ID ", "name": " INSTANCE ID ", "region": " REGION ", "gceZone": " ZONE " } To see how the underlying REST API request is constructed for this task, see the APIs Explorer on the instances:insert page .
