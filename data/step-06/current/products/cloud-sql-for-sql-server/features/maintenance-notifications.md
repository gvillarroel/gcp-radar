- If issues occur with your Cloud SQL instance, review the following during troubleshooting: Debugging connection issues Known issues Troubleshooting Instance configuration and administration Best practice More information Read and follow the operational guidelines to ensure that your instances are covered by the Cloud SQL SLA .
- If the enable automatic storage increases instance setting is disabled or the automatic storage increase limit is enabled, ensure you have at least 20% available space to accommodate any critical database maintenance operations that Cloud SQL may perform.
- Testing maintenance rollouts gives you a better understanding of how your application handles scheduled maintenance and how quickly the system can recover.

### Availability in Cloud SQL \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/sql/docs/availability](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sql/docs/availability)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 77
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Maintenance , which includes the following operations with sub-second downtime: Automatic maintenance that Cloud SQL performs every quarter Self-service maintenance that you can initiate at any time Maintenance simulation that you can initiate to test the sub-second downtime behavior Minor version upgrade Perform a minor version upgrade on a MySQL 8.0 instance with sub-second downtime For PostgreSQL instances, minor version upgrades are part of automatic maintenance and happen with sub-second downtime Edition upgrade Perform an in-place upgrade to Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition Enable data cache You can enable or disable data cache as frequently as needed Instance scaling Scale-up: Increase the compute size (vCPU, memory) of your Cloud SQL instance as frequently as needed Scale-down: Reduce the compute size (vCPU, memory) of your Cloud SQL instance infrequently Note: If you scale down your instance more than once during a three-hour period, then only the first scale down event benefits from near-zero downtime.
- Planned operations with near-zero downtime For planned operations such as maintenance or some instance reconfigurations, Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition offers near-zero downtime for primary instances with no application changes or proxy requirements.
- For instances configured with regional availability, if the instance encounters a failure, then Cloud SQL automatically brings up the instance in the secondary zone with the same IP address and no data loss so that applications can resume operations on the database.
- Unplanned events and zonal outage For applications that require high availability, we recommend configuring the instance for regional availability, also referred to as the high availability (HA) configuration in Cloud SQL.
