- ImageCollection ( 'LANDSAT/LC09/C02/T1 L2' ) Simple cloud score For scoring Landsat pixels by their relative cloudiness, Earth Engine provides a rudimentary cloud scoring algorithm in the ee.Algorithms.Landsat.simpleCloudScore() method. (For details on the implementation, see this Code Editor sample script ).
- This example creates a simple composite using default parameters and compares it to a composite using custom parameters for the cloud score threshold and the percentile: Code Editor (JavaScript) // Load a raw Landsat 5 ImageCollection for a single year. var collection = ee .
