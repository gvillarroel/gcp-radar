Evidence snippets:
- Added camel-case aliases Image.firstNonZero() and bitwise operators ( Image.bitwiseAnd() ).
- Earth Engine Server Feature Added ee.Image.directionalDistanceTransform() , which calculates the distance to non-zero pixels in a given direction.
- Image.mask(x) now sets the pixels that it unmasks to zero (or to the value closest to zero within the range of the pixel type of the input image).

Evidence snippets:
- To do that, first convert the multi-band Landsat image into an “Array Image”, where each pixel is an Array of band values.
- Image ( coefficients ) . matrixMultiply ( arrayImage2D ) // Get rid of the extra dimensions. . arrayProject ([ 0 ]) . arrayFlatten ( [[ 'brightness' , 'greenness' , 'wetness' , 'fourth' , 'fifth' , 'sixth' ]]); // Display the first three bands of the result and the input imagery. var vizParams = { bands : [ 'brightness' , 'greenness' , 'wetness' ], min : - 0.1 , max : [ 0.5 , 0.1 , 0.1 ] }; Map . setCenter ( - 122.3 , 37.562 , 10 ); Map . addLayer ( image , { bands : [ 'B5' , 'B4' , 'B3' ], min : 0 , max : 0.5 }, 'image' ); Map . addLayer ( componentsImage , vizParams , 'components' ); Python setup See the Python Environment page for information on the Python API and using geemap for interactive development. import ee import geemap.core as geemap Colab (Python) Define an Array of Tasseled Cap coefficients. coefficients = ee .
- Image ( 'LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1 TOA/LC08 044034 20140318' ) . select ( [ 'B2' , 'B3' , 'B4' , 'B5' , 'B6' , 'B7' ] ) Make an Array Image, with a 1-D Array per pixel. array image 1d = image . toArray () Make an Array Image with a 2-D Array per pixel, 6x1. array image 2d = array image 1d . toArray ( 1 ) In this example, note that toArray() converts image to an array image in which each pixel is a 1-D vector, the entries of which correspond to the 6 values at the corresponding positions in the bands of image .
- Image ( coefficients ) . matrixMultiply ( array image 2d ) Get rid of the extra dimensions. . arrayProject ([ 0 ]) . arrayFlatten ( [[ 'brightness' , 'greenness' , 'wetness' , 'fourth' , 'fifth' , 'sixth' ]] ) ) Display the first three bands of the result and the input imagery. viz params = { 'bands' : [ 'brightness' , 'greenness' , 'wetness' ], 'min' : - 0.1 , 'max' : [ 0.5 , 0.1 , 0.1 ], } m = geemap .

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 114
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Image ( 'projects/google/Logistic regression stack 0b8023b0af6c1b0ac7b5be649b54db06' ); // Take a very small sample first, to debug. var testSample = exportedStack . addBands ( loss16 ). stratifiedSample ({ numPoints : 1 , classBand : 'loss16' , region : testRegion , scale : 30 , geometries : true }); print ( testSample ); // Check this in the console. // Take a large sample. var sample = exportedStack . addBands ( loss16 ). stratifiedSample ({ numPoints : 10000 , classBand : 'loss16' , region : geometry , scale : 30 , }); // Export the large sample...
- Reducer . mean (), geometry : feature . geometry (), scale : 500 })). set ({ time : image . date (). millis (), date : image . date (). format () }). copyProperties ( feature ); })); data = data . merge ( fc ); } print ( data . first ()); Note that the first() thing from each collection is printed, for debugging purposes.
- To get mean and SD images (for example to normalize the input image), you can turn the values into an image and use regexes to extract means and SDs individually as demonstrated in the example.
- Use a non-zero errorMargin For possibly expensive geometry operations, use the largest error margin possible given the required precision of the computation.
