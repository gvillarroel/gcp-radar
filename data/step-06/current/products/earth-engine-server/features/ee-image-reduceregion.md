- Added an ee.Classifier.decisionTree() algorithm for loading pre-existing decision trees as Classifier objects Fixed singular value exceptions when computing the parameter stability test in Image.formaTrend() , to match behavior of original FORMA.
- Exporting complex images will sometimes be faster, and may succeed when it previously failed.
