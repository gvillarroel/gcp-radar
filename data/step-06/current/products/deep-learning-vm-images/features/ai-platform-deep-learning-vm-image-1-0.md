Evidence snippets:
- List all available versions using gcloud CLI You can also list all available Deep Learning VM images using the following gcloud CLI command: gcloud compute images list \ --project deeplearning-platform-release \ --format="value(NAME)" \ --no-standard-images Note: The output of this command includes some image family framework types that aren't mentioned in the previous table of family names .
- To create a Deep Learning VM instance that uses a deprecated image, see the following example gcloud CLI command: gcloud compute instances create deprecated-tf-vm \ --image = projects/deeplearning-platform-release/global/images/ IMAGE NAME \ --machine-type = n1-standard-4 \ --zone = us-east1-c Replace IMAGE NAME with the name of the image, as follows: To use a specific image in the image family, use the image name, for example: pytorch-2-9-cu129-ubuntu-2204-nvidia-580-v20260416 .
- Replace IMAGE FAMILY with the image family name for which you want to find out the latest version number. gcloud compute images describe-from-family IMAGE FAMILY \ --project deeplearning-platform-release Look for the name field in the output and use the image name given there when creating new instances.
- Specific Deep Learning VM Images images are available to suit your choice of framework and processor.

Evidence snippets:
- To create a Deep Learning VM instance with the latest PyTorch image family and one or more attached GPUs, enter the following at the command line: export IMAGE FAMILY = "pytorch-latest-gpu" export ZONE = "us-west1-b" export INSTANCE NAME = "my-instance" gcloud compute instances create $ INSTANCE NAME \ -- zone =$ ZONE \ -- image - family =$ IMAGE FAMILY \ -- image - project = deeplearning - platform - release \ -- maintenance - policy = TERMINATE \ -- accelerator = "type=nvidia-tesla-v100,count=1" \ -- metadata = "install-nvidia-driver=True" Options: --image-family must be either pytorch-latest-gpu or pytorch- VERSION - CUDA-VERSION (for example, pytorch-1-10-cu110 ). --image-project must be deeplearning-platform-release . --maintenance-policy must be TERMINATE .
- Without GPUs To create a Deep Learning VM instance with the latest PyTorch image family and a CPU, enter the following at the command line: export IMAGE FAMILY = "pytorch-latest-cpu" export ZONE = "us-west1-b" export INSTANCE NAME = "my-instance" gcloud compute instances create $ INSTANCE NAME \ -- zone =$ ZONE \ -- image - family =$ IMAGE FAMILY \ -- image - project = deeplearning - platform - release Options: --image-family must be either pytorch-latest-cpu or pytorch- VERSION -cpu (for example, pytorch-1-13-cpu ). --image-project must be deeplearning-platform-release .
