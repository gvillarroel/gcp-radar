- Note: If you are using GPUs with your Deep Learning VM, check the quotas page to ensure that you have enough GPUs available in your project: Quotas .
- To provision a Deep Learning VM instance with one or more GPUs: export IMAGE FAMILY = "tf-ent-latest-gpu" export ZONE = "us-west1-b" export INSTANCE NAME = "my-instance" gcloud compute instances create $ INSTANCE NAME \ -- zone =$ ZONE \ -- image - family =$ IMAGE FAMILY \ -- image - project = deeplearning - platform - release \ -- maintenance - policy = TERMINATE \ -- accelerator = "type=nvidia-tesla-v100,count=1" \ -- metadata = "install-nvidia-driver=True" Options: --image-family must be one of the GPU-specific image types.
- Creating an instance without GPUs To provision a Deep Learning VM instance with a CPU but no GPU: export IMAGE FAMILY = "tf-ent-latest-cpu" export ZONE = "us-west1-b" export INSTANCE NAME = "my-instance" gcloud compute instances create $ INSTANCE NAME \ -- zone =$ ZONE \ -- image - family =$ IMAGE FAMILY \ -- image - project = deeplearning - platform - release Options: --image-family must be one of the CPU-specific image types.
- Before you begin To use the Google Cloud CLI to create a new Deep Learning VM instance, you must first install and initialize the Google Cloud CLI : Download and install the Google Cloud CLI using the instructions given on Installing Google Cloud CLI .
