Evidence snippets:
- To set up SSH port forwarding , complete the following steps, and then access your JupyterLab session through a local browser: Run the following command by using the Google Cloud CLI in your preferred terminal or in Cloud Shell : gcloud compute ssh \ --project PROJECT ID \ --zone ZONE \ INSTANCE NAME \ -- -L 8080 :localhost:8080 Replace the following: PROJECT ID : your Google Cloud project ID ZONE : the zone where your instance is located INSTANCE NAME : the name of your instance Note: If using Cloud Shell to run the command, add a -4 to the SSH flags to use IPv4 to connect.
- Example: -- -4 -L LOCAL PORT :localhost: REMOTE PORT Access your JupyterLab session through a local browser: If you ran the command on your local machine, visit https://localhost:8080 to access JupyterLab.

Evidence snippets:
- To create a Deep Learning VM instance with the latest PyTorch image family and one or more attached GPUs, enter the following at the command line: export IMAGE FAMILY = "pytorch-latest-gpu" export ZONE = "us-west1-b" export INSTANCE NAME = "my-instance" gcloud compute instances create $ INSTANCE NAME \ -- zone =$ ZONE \ -- image - family =$ IMAGE FAMILY \ -- image - project = deeplearning - platform - release \ -- maintenance - policy = TERMINATE \ -- accelerator = "type=nvidia-tesla-v100,count=1" \ -- metadata = "install-nvidia-driver=True" Options: --image-family must be either pytorch-latest-gpu or pytorch- VERSION - CUDA-VERSION (for example, pytorch-1-10-cu110 ). --image-project must be deeplearning-platform-release . --maintenance-policy must be TERMINATE .
- Without GPUs To create a Deep Learning VM instance with the latest PyTorch image family and a CPU, enter the following at the command line: export IMAGE FAMILY = "pytorch-latest-cpu" export ZONE = "us-west1-b" export INSTANCE NAME = "my-instance" gcloud compute instances create $ INSTANCE NAME \ -- zone =$ ZONE \ -- image - family =$ IMAGE FAMILY \ -- image - project = deeplearning - platform - release Options: --image-family must be either pytorch-latest-cpu or pytorch- VERSION -cpu (for example, pytorch-1-13-cpu ). --image-project must be deeplearning-platform-release .
- You have the option to select Enable access to JupyterLab via URL instead of SSH (Beta) .
- Enabling this Beta feature lets you access your JupyterLab instance using a URL.
