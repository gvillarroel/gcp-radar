- When you start a Deep Learning VM Images instance, a JupyterLab session is initialized.
- To set up SSH port forwarding , complete the following steps, and then access your JupyterLab session through a local browser: Run the following command by using the Google Cloud CLI in your preferred terminal or in Cloud Shell : gcloud compute ssh \ --project PROJECT ID \ --zone ZONE \ INSTANCE NAME \ -- -L 8080 :localhost:8080 Replace the following: PROJECT ID : your Google Cloud project ID ZONE : the zone where your instance is located INSTANCE NAME : the name of your instance Note: If using Cloud Shell to run the command, add a -4 to the SSH flags to use IPv4 to connect.
- Example: -- -4 -L LOCAL PORT :localhost: REMOTE PORT Access your JupyterLab session through a local browser: If you ran the command on your local machine, visit https://localhost:8080 to access JupyterLab.
