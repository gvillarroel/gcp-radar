- This topic contains instructions for creating a new Deep Learning VM Images instance from the command line.
- To provision a Deep Learning VM instance with one or more GPUs: export IMAGE FAMILY = "tf-ent-latest-gpu" export ZONE = "us-west1-b" export INSTANCE NAME = "my-instance" gcloud compute instances create $ INSTANCE NAME \ -- zone =$ ZONE \ -- image - family =$ IMAGE FAMILY \ -- image - project = deeplearning - platform - release \ -- maintenance - policy = TERMINATE \ -- accelerator = "type=nvidia-tesla-v100,count=1" \ -- metadata = "install-nvidia-driver=True" Options: --image-family must be one of the GPU-specific image types.
- Creating an instance without GPUs To provision a Deep Learning VM instance with a CPU but no GPU: export IMAGE FAMILY = "tf-ent-latest-cpu" export ZONE = "us-west1-b" export INSTANCE NAME = "my-instance" gcloud compute instances create $ INSTANCE NAME \ -- zone =$ ZONE \ -- image - family =$ IMAGE FAMILY \ -- image - project = deeplearning - platform - release Options: --image-family must be one of the CPU-specific image types.

Evidence snippets:
- Run the following at the command line, giving the new image a name and a family name: gcloud compute images create " NEW IMAGE NAME " \ --source-disk DEPLOYMENT NAME \ --source-disk-zone ZONE \ --family NEW FAMILY NAME Once the command is finished running, you have a new image with NVIDIA drivers preinstalled that you can use to create new Deep Learning VM instances.
- Home Documentation Compute Compute Engine Deep Learning VM Images Guides Send feedback Create a new image from an existing Deep Learning VM instance Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- One way to prevent this is to create your own image that is based on one of the Deep Learning VM images, but that already has the NVIDIA drivers preinstalled.
- Creating a TensorFlow Deep Learning VM Instance Creating a PyTorch Deep Learning VM Instance Creating a Deep Learning VM Instance from the Command Line Creating a Deep Learning VM Instance from the Cloud Marketplace Verify NVIDIA driver install Once the instance has booted, verify that the NVIDIA driver has been installed: SSH to your image: gcloud compute ssh " DEPLOYMENT NAME " Run the following command: nvidia-smi If the drivers have been installed, you can continue.
