Evidence snippets:
- List all available versions using gcloud CLI You can also list all available Deep Learning VM images using the following gcloud CLI command: gcloud compute images list \ --project deeplearning-platform-release \ --format="value(NAME)" \ --no-standard-images Note: The output of this command includes some image family framework types that aren't mentioned in the previous table of family names .
- To create a Deep Learning VM instance that uses a deprecated image, see the following example gcloud CLI command: gcloud compute instances create deprecated-tf-vm \ --image = projects/deeplearning-platform-release/global/images/ IMAGE NAME \ --machine-type = n1-standard-4 \ --zone = us-east1-c Replace IMAGE NAME with the name of the image, as follows: To use a specific image in the image family, use the image name, for example: pytorch-2-9-cu129-ubuntu-2204-nvidia-580-v20260416 .
- Replace IMAGE FAMILY with the image family name for which you want to find out the latest version number. gcloud compute images describe-from-family IMAGE FAMILY \ --project deeplearning-platform-release Look for the name field in the output and use the image name given there when creating new instances.
