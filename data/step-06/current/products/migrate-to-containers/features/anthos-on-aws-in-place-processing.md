- On the quickstart-local-vm command tab, install the gke-gcloud-auth-plugin plugin : sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk-gke-gcloud-auth-plugin Install kubectl : sudo apt-get install kubectl Connect to the cluster quickstart-cluster : gcloud container clusters get-credentials quickstart-cluster \ --zone us-central1-a --project PROJECT ID Open the migration-artifacts folder: cd migration-artifacts To expose the workload to the internet, add a new LoadBalancer service in the deployment spec.yaml file.
- In Cloud Shell, create a new Kubernetes cluster: gcloud container clusters create quickstart-cluster \ --zone = us-central1-a --machine-type = e2-medium \ --image-type = ubuntu containerd --num-nodes = 1 \ --logging = SYSTEM,WORKLOAD,API SERVER,SCHEDULER,CONTROLLER MANAGER Allow a few minutes for the cluster creation to complete.
- Copy the source machine's file system: ./m2c copy gcloud \ --project PROJECT ID --zone us-central1-a \ --vm-name quickstart-source-vm --output quickstart-vm-filesystem \ --filters filters.txt Replace PROJECT ID with the ID of the project.
