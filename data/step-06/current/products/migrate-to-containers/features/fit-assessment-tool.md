- Customize migration plan for WebSphere traditional workloads Important: The websphere-traditional plugin is now deprecated.
- You can edit the arguments. scannerOptions : Setting 'includeSensitiveData: true' will upload sensitive data, if exists, such as private keys, to the artifacts repository includeSensitiveData : false sourceAppServer : was90 Note: In order to collect sensitive data, in the migration plan, under scannerOptions , modify the value of includeSensitiveData: to be true .
- Edit the migration plan After you have copied the file system and analyzed it, you can find the migration plan in the new directory that is created in the specified output path: ANALYSIS OUTPUT PATH / config.yaml .
