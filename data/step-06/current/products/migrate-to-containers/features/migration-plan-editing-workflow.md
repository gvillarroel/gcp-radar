Evidence snippets:
- The following is an example migration plan containing identitytype : migrationPlan : applications : iis : applicationhost : apppools : - name : DefaultAppPool Allowed values include: ApplicationPoolIdentity (default), NetworkService, LocalSystem, LocalService identitytype="NetworkService" - managedruntimeversion : v4.0 name : .NET v4.5 Classic - managedruntimeversion : v4.0 name : .NET v4.5 When you execute the migration plan to generate the container artifacts, Migrate to Containers automatically adds the necessary Dockerfile directives according to the identitytype field setting.
- Some connection strings might not be detected and should be added by editing the migration plan as shown preceding. (For example, if the connection strings are in an encrypted section of the applicationhost.config file).
- You can define these probes manually when you customize the migration plan.
- You can modify the list of runtimes in the migration plan by adding or removing members of msvcRuntimes : The complete list of possible values are: (The 2015 runtime also includes support for 2017, 2019, and 2022) msvcRuntimes : - MSVC2012 x64 - MSVC2013 x64 - MSVC2015 x64 - MSVC2012 x86 - MSVC2013 x86 - MSVC2015 x86 The pathEnvVarAdditionalEntries section Windows IIS applications might have non-default PATH environment variable entries, which are automatically detected on the source VM and included in the migration plan.

Evidence snippets:
- Migrate to Containers then writes information about those detected files to the logPaths area of the migration plan: deployment : ... logPaths : - appName : APP NAME globs : - LOG PATH For example: deployment : ... logPaths : - appName : tomcat globs : - /var/log/tomcat /catalina.out When you generate the migration artifacts, Migrate to Containers generates the logs.yaml file from the migration plan.
- The advantage to editing the migration plan is that your edits are reflected in logs.yaml every time you generate the artifacts.
- When you generate the migration plan, Migrate to Containers automatically searches for log destination files on the source VM.
- When generating the migration plan, Migrate to Containers: Ignores NFS mounts for /sys and /dev .

Evidence snippets:
- Create a migration plan for Tomcat workloads For Tomcat app components, this process requires the catalina-home and catalina-base paths as inputs.
- Create a migration plan for JBoss workloads For JBoss app components, creating a migration plan requires the JBOSS HOME variable as an input.
- To retrieve this value, check the running JBoss server process: ps aux grep jboss.home.dir To perform the analysis, run the following command: ./m2c analyze \ -s PATH TO COPIED FILESYSTEM \ -p jboss-container \ -o ANALYSIS OUTPUT PATH \ -r jboss-home= PATH TO JBOSS HOME Replace the following: PATH TO COPIED FILESYSTEM : the path to copied file system directory ANALYSIS OUTPUT PATH : the path to the folder where you want the analysis output to be created PATH TO JBOSS HOME : path to the JBoss installation After the analysis is complete, a new directory is created in the specified output path which contains the migration plan, config.yaml .
- Create a migration plan for WordPress workloads To perform the analysis, run the following command: ./m2c analyze \ -s PATH TO COPIED FILESYSTEM \ -p wordpress-container \ -o ANALYSIS OUTPUT PATH Replace the following: PATH TO COPIED FILESYSTEM : the path to copied file system directory ANALYSIS OUTPUT PATH : the path to the folder where you want the analysis output to be created After the analysis is complete, a new directory is created in the specified output path which contains the migration plan, config.yaml .
