Evidence snippets:
- Create an instance with a logging agent enabled Console To run a Compute Engine instance on Container-Optimized OS with the fluent-bit logging agent enabled, perform the following: Open the Compute Engine instance creation page on Google Cloud console.
- Logging agent configuration compatibility The logging agent is a fluentd-based container on x86-based Container-Optimized OS images and a fluent-bit binary on Arm-based Container-Optimized OS images.
- Selecting the logging agent x86-based Container-Optimized OS 105 and 109 images ship two implementations of the logging agent: fluentd (legacy) and fluent-bit.
- For Arm images of all versions and x86 images for Container-Optimized OS 109 and later, the logging agent is a built-in OS package called fluent-bit .

- Final score: 85
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Cloud Logging agent Container-Optimized OS Arm-based images use fluent-bit as Cloud Logging agent and x86-based images use fluentd.
- The following table describes which containers are compatible with Arm-based images: Container images Compatible with Arm-based images gcr.io/cos-cloud/toolbox Yes gcr.io/cos-cloud/cos-gpu-installer No gcr.io/stackdriver-agents/stackdriver-logging-agent No gcr.io/gce-containers/konlet No Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- However, if you have custom fluentd configurations, you might experience breakage when migrating workloads to Arm-based Container-Optimized OS images.
- You can also see all available releases on command line by running the following command: gcloud compute images list --project cos-cloud --no-standard-images --filter = "name 'cos-arm64- '" The output is similar to the following: NAME PROJECT FAMILY DEPRECATED STATUS cos-arm64-101-17162-40-5 cos-cloud cos-arm64-101-lts READY cos-arm64-beta-101-17162-40-5 cos-cloud cos-arm64-beta READY cos-arm64-dev-105-17228-0-0 cos-cloud cos-arm64-dev READY cos-arm64-stable-101-17162-40-5 cos-cloud cos-arm64-stable READY Arm-based Container-Optimized OS images share the same versioning scheme and LTS milestone lifecycle with x86-based images.
