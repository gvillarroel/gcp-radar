Evidence snippets:
- You can use cloud-init to enable health monitoring with the following cloud-config example: #cloud-config runcmd: - systemctl start node-problem-detector Using metadata In Container-Optimized OS Milestone 88 and later, the Node Problem Detector can also be enabled by setting the value of google-monitoring-enabled to true in the custom metadata section.
- To enable monitoring when creating an instance: gcloud compute instances create VM NAME \ --image= IMAGE \ --image-project=cos-cloud \ --metadata=google-monitoring-enabled=true Replace the following: VM NAME : name of the new VM IMAGE : a specific version of a public Container-Optimized OS image.
- Disabling health monitoring To disable the service that has already been enabled through your cloud-config or through your startup script , remove the systemctl start node-problem-detector step, and then reboot the Container-Optimized OS instance.

Evidence snippets:
- The following entries in the /etc/chrony/chrony.conf configuration file show commented out default configuration values to help the administrator make any desired changes: cat /etc/chrony/chrony.conf Use custom NTP servers server metadata.google.internal prefer iburst Record the rate at which the system clock gains/losses time. driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift Allow the system clock to be stepped in the first three updates if its offset is larger than 1 second. makestep 1.0 3 Enable kernel synchronization of the real-time clock (RTC). rtcsync The NTP server is set from eth0 's DHCP response, which is usually the Compute Engine's metadata server: networkctl status eth0 grep NTP NTP: 169.254.169.254 Changing the time zone The default time zone of Container-Optimized OS from Google is UTC0.

- You can also see all currently available releases on command line by running the following command: gcloud compute images list --project cos-cloud --no-standard-images The output is similar to the following: NAME PROJECT FAMILY DEPRECATED STATUS cos-69-10895-385-0 cos-cloud cos-69-lts READY cos-73-11647-534-0 cos-cloud cos-73-lts READY cos-77-12371-251-0 cos-cloud cos-77-lts READY cos-81-12871-103-0 cos-cloud cos-81-lts READY cos-beta-81-12871-44-0 cos-cloud cos-beta READY cos-dev-84-13078-0-0 cos-cloud cos-dev READY cos-stable-81-12871-103-0 cos-cloud cos-stable READY Note: The most current Container-Optimized OS images are now available under the project cos-cloud , and use the name prefix of cos .
- Assuming the cloud-init file is called filename in the current directory, the following command creates a Container-Optimized OS instance and trigger cloud-init by assigning the contents of the file to the user-data key in the Instance Metadata: gcloud compute instances create instance-name \ --image image-name \ --image-project cos-cloud \ --metadata-from-file user-data= filename Replace the following: instance-name : the name of your VM instance. image-name : the name of the Container-Optimized OS image for the instance.

- The Container-Optimized OS CIS Benchmark is a set of recommendations for configuring instances that use Container-Optimized OS to support a strong security posture.
- This level includes recommendations such as the following: Firewall rules exist for all open ports ICMP redirects and router advertisements are not accepted Default user shell timeout is 900 seconds or less How Container-Optimized OS complies with the CIS Benchmarks Starting with Milestone 97 , Container-Optimized OS images comply with to CIS Level 1 by default and provide an option to comply with CIS Level 2.
- Periodic checking of CIS compliance status Container-Optimized OS images include the following services to periodically check CIS compliance: cis-compliance-scanner.service : checks the compliance status based on environment variables defined at /etc/cis-scanner/env vars .
