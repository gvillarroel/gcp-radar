- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 68
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- To preload the GPU driver, run the following command: sudo cos-extensions install gpu -- -no-verify -target-gpu= GPU DEVICE This command is supported starting from cos-gpu-installer:v2.3.0 .
- For earlier Container-Optimized OS release milestones, use the cos-gpu-installer open source tool to manually install GPU drivers.
- Container-Optimized OS provides a built-in utility cos-extensions to simplify the NVIDIA driver installation process.
- End-to-end: Running a GPU application on Container-Optimized OS The following end-to-end example shows you how to use cloud-init to configure Container-Optimized OS VM instances that provision a GPU application container myapp:latest after the GPU driver has been installed: #cloud-config users : - name : myuser uid : 2000 write files : - path : /etc/systemd/system/install-gpu.service permissions : 0644 owner : root content : [Unit] Description=Install GPU drivers Wants=gcr-online.target docker.socket After=gcr-online.target docker.socket [Service] User=root Type=oneshot ExecStart=cos-extensions install gpu StandardOutput=journal+console StandardError=journal+console - path : /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service permissions : 0644 owner : root content : [Unit] Description=Run a myapp GPU application container Requires=install-gpu.service After=install-gpu.service [Service] User=root Type=oneshot RemainAfterExit=true ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm -u 2000 --name=myapp --device /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0 myapp:latest StandardOutput=journal+console StandardError=journal+console runcmd : - systemctl daemon-reload - systemctl start install-gpu.service - systemctl start myapp.service About the NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries CUDA® is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model for GPUs.

### Using Cloud Logging with Container-Optimized OS \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/how-to/logging](https://docs.cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/how-to/logging)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 38
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Known Limitations Compatibility with gcplogs driver Starting with milestone 89 , if the logging agent included with Container-Optimized OS is enabled and Docker gcplogs logging driver is enabled for one or more containers, excessive warning logs may be output by the included logging agent.
- A workaround is to not use gcplogs as a Docker logging driver, and to instead use the default driver as configured by Container-Optimized OS.
- The docker command that starts the logging agent is defined in the Container-Optimized OS source for stackdriver-logging systemd service .
- The version of the containerized agent being run is defined in the Container-Optimized OS source app-admin/stackdriver directory .

- Final score: 31
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Container-Optimized OS may not be the right choice for you in the following cases: Your application is not containerized or your containerized application depends on kernel modules, drivers and other additional packages that are not available in Container-Optimized OS.
- Features and Benefits Container-Optimized OS provides the following benefits: Run Containers Out of the Box : Container-Optimized OS instances come pre-installed with the Docker and containerd runtimes and cloud-init .
- Compute Engine provides images for other popular operating systems, including images that are optimized for containers .
- The Container-Optimized OS kernel is locked down; you'll be unable to install third-party kernel modules or drivers.
