Evidence snippets:
- Using user-defined guest policies Container-Optimized OS includes OS Config agent , that uses OS system utilities to maintain the state for the VM that is specified in the guest policy.
- The following guest policy enables the Node problem detector agent on all the instances. recipes: - name: recipe-enable-npd desiredState: INSTALLED installSteps: - scriptRun: interpreter: SHELL script: - #!/bin/bash systemctl start node-problem-detector Viewing the collected metrics Node Problem Detector reports a list of metrics against a Compute Engine instance monitored resource.
- Starting with Milestone 77, Container-Optimized OS includes the Node Problem Detector agent.
- You can use cloud-init to enable health monitoring with the following cloud-config example: #cloud-config runcmd: - systemctl start node-problem-detector Using metadata In Container-Optimized OS Milestone 88 and later, the Node Problem Detector can also be enabled by setting the value of google-monitoring-enabled to true in the custom metadata section.

Evidence snippets:
- The following entries in the /etc/chrony/chrony.conf configuration file show commented out default configuration values to help the administrator make any desired changes: cat /etc/chrony/chrony.conf Use custom NTP servers server metadata.google.internal prefer iburst Record the rate at which the system clock gains/losses time. driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift Allow the system clock to be stepped in the first three updates if its offset is larger than 1 second. makestep 1.0 3 Enable kernel synchronization of the real-time clock (RTC). rtcsync The NTP server is set from eth0 's DHCP response, which is usually the Compute Engine's metadata server: networkctl status eth0 grep NTP NTP: 169.254.169.254 Changing the time zone The default time zone of Container-Optimized OS from Google is UTC0.
- Time synchronization Before milestone 85 , Container-Optimized OS uses systemd 's systemd-timesyncd service to synchronize the local system clock with a remote Network Time Protocol (NTP) server via the SNTP protocol.
- Starting from milestone 85, Container-Optimized OS uses chronyd service to synchronize the local system clock with a remote Network Time Protocol (NTP) server via the NTP protocol.
- You can also see all currently available releases on command line by running the following command: gcloud compute images list --project cos-cloud --no-standard-images The output is similar to the following: NAME PROJECT FAMILY DEPRECATED STATUS cos-69-10895-385-0 cos-cloud cos-69-lts READY cos-73-11647-534-0 cos-cloud cos-73-lts READY cos-77-12371-251-0 cos-cloud cos-77-lts READY cos-81-12871-103-0 cos-cloud cos-81-lts READY cos-beta-81-12871-44-0 cos-cloud cos-beta READY cos-dev-84-13078-0-0 cos-cloud cos-dev READY cos-stable-81-12871-103-0 cos-cloud cos-stable READY Note: The most current Container-Optimized OS images are now available under the project cos-cloud , and use the name prefix of cos .
