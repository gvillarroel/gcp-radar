Evidence snippets:
- Using Container-Optimized OS Container-Optimized OS is the default node OS Image in Kubernetes Engine and other Kubernetes deployments on Google Cloud Platform.
- With Container-Optimized OS, you can bring up your containers on Google Cloud Platform quickly, efficiently, and securely.
- Container-Optimized OS is not supported outside of the Google Cloud Platform environment.
- Limitations Container-Optimized OS has limited or no support for some of the common features you may be familiar with on other operating systems: Container-Optimized OS does not include a package manager; as such, you'll be unable to install software packages directly on an instance.

Evidence snippets:
- Security-hardened kernel Container-Optimized OS enables several security-hardening kernel features, including Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA), Audit, Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI), and some Linux Security Modules (LSMs) from Chromium OS.
- OS Security Based on Chromium OS , Container-Optimized OS from Google implements several security design principles to provide a well-configured platform for running production services.
- Infrastructure Security In addition to various hardening features in the OS itself, the Container-Optimized OS team also takes the software supply chain seriously and prioritizes infrastructure security when developing, building, and deploying images, based on years of experience from both Chromium OS and Google in general.
- Testing and qualification process Before we publish a new Container-Optimized OS image to Google Cloud, we test it at multiple levels—including kernel fuzz testing by syzkaller , cluster-level Kubernetes tests, integration testing with Compute Engine features, and several performance benchmarks.

Evidence snippets:
- Collecting the sosreport data To generate a sosreport: Connect to the instance using the gcloud compute ssh command. gcloud compute ssh [INSTANCE NAME] --zone [ZONE] --project [PROJECT ID] Check the OS version: sudo cat /etc/os-release egrep -w 'NAME VERSION' The output is similar to the following: NAME="Container-Optimized OS" VERSION=105 Run the sos command that corresponds to your OS version: COS 85 and earlier Run the following sosreport command to collect the logs: sudo sosreport --all-logs --batch --tmp-dir = /var If the previous command fails with sosreport: command not found , install the sosreport package and then run the previous sosreport command: sudo toolbox sudo apt install sosreport -y COS 105 and later Run the following sos command to collect the logs: sudo sos report --all-logs --batch --tmp-dir = /var If the previous command fails with sos: command not found , install the sosreport package and then run the previous sos report command: sudo toolbox sudo apt install sosreport -y Ubuntu-18 and earlier Run the following sosreport command to collect the logs: sudo sosreport --all-logs --batch --tmp-dir = /var If the previous command fails with sosreport: command not found , install the sosreport package and then run the previous sosreport command: sudo apt install sosreport Ubuntu-20 and later Run the following sos command to collect the logs: sudo sos report --all-logs --batch --tmp-dir = /var If the previous command fails with sos: command not found , install the sosreport package and then run the previous sos report command: sudo apt install sosreport You can change the directory where the report is stored by passing a different directory to the --tmp-dir option.
