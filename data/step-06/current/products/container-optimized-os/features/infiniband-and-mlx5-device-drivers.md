Evidence snippets:
- End-to-end: Running a GPU application on Container-Optimized OS The following end-to-end example shows you how to use cloud-init to configure Container-Optimized OS VM instances that provision a GPU application container myapp:latest after the GPU driver has been installed: #cloud-config users : - name : myuser uid : 2000 write files : - path : /etc/systemd/system/install-gpu.service permissions : 0644 owner : root content : [Unit] Description=Install GPU drivers Wants=gcr-online.target docker.socket After=gcr-online.target docker.socket [Service] User=root Type=oneshot ExecStart=cos-extensions install gpu StandardOutput=journal+console StandardError=journal+console - path : /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service permissions : 0644 owner : root content : [Unit] Description=Run a myapp GPU application container Requires=install-gpu.service After=install-gpu.service [Service] User=root Type=oneshot RemainAfterExit=true ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm -u 2000 --name=myapp --device /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0 myapp:latest StandardOutput=journal+console StandardError=journal+console runcmd : - systemctl daemon-reload - systemctl start install-gpu.service - systemctl start myapp.service About the NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries CUDA® is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model for GPUs.
- Restrictions Container-Optimized OS version restrictions Only Container-Optimized OS LTS release milestone 85 and later support the cos-extensions utility mentioned in the Installing NVIDIA GPU device drivers section.
- The following example shows you how to run a CUDA application in a Docker container that consumes /dev/nvidia0 : docker run \ --volume /var/lib/nvidia/lib64:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64 \ --volume /var/lib/nvidia/bin:/usr/local/nvidia/bin \ --device /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0 \ --device /dev/nvidia-uvm:/dev/nvidia-uvm \ --device /dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl \ registry.k8s.io/cuda-vector-add:v0.1 You can run your containers through cloud-init to specify the dependency between driver installation and your containers. see the End-to-end: Running a GPU application on Container-Optimized OS section for more details.
- For example, on a COS VM, you could use the following command to install the NVIDIA driver and load the nvidia.ko kernel module with the NVreg EnableGpuFirmware=0 parameter. sudo cos-extensions install gpu -- --module-arg nvidia.NVreg EnableGpuFirmware=0 Preload the driver You can preload the GPU driver on your Container-Optimized OS instance even when no GPU device is attached.

Evidence snippets:
- Working with the Container-Optimized OS file system The following is a list of paths in the Container-Optimized OS node image file system, along with their properties and recommended usage: Path Properties Purpose / read-only executable The root filesystem is mounted as read-only to maintain integrity.
- Home Documentation Compute Compute Engine Container-Optimized OS Guides Send feedback Disks and file system overview Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- When using Container-Optimized OS, be aware of the partitioning if you run your own services that have certain expectations about the file system layout outside of containers.
- Since /etc/ is stateless on Container-Optimized OS, you cannot use /etc/fstab to automatically fsck (file system consistency check) and mount the disks on boot.

Evidence snippets:
- Prerequisites To build a Container-Optimized OS image, you'll need to install the following tools on your development machine: git and curl A package of Chromium scripts called depot tools that includes tools like repo and cros sdk .
- The test image includes the debug tools from the dev image as well as tools necessary for running automatic Container-Optimized OS tests.
- To build Container-Optimized OS, specify lakitu (x86 image) or lakitu-arm64 (Arm image) for the board name as follows: x86 image build packages --board = lakitu build image --board = lakitu test Arm image build packages --board = lakitu-arm64 build image --board = lakitu-arm64 test In addition to test , you can build either a base , or dev image by passing the appropriate parameter to the ./build image script command.
- You can use the cros sdk tool included in depot tools to create and enter a chroot that's ready for Container-Optimized OS compilation by running the following command in the source directory that you created in the previous step: cd $HOME/cos-src cros sdk --enter Once inside chroot , you can build the disk image.
