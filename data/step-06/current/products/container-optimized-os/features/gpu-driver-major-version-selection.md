Evidence snippets:
- You may also check all the GPU driver versions supported by the GPU on your Container-Optimized OS VM instance by running the following command: sudo cos-extensions list Identify the required CUDA toolkit version If your applications use CUDA , install NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit in your containers.
- To install a specific GPU driver version, run the following command: sudo cos-extensions install gpu -- -version= DRIVER VERSION Replace DRIVER VERSION with one of the following options: default : Installs the default driver designated by the Container-Optimized OS release.
- For example, in the supported GPU driver version list for Container-Optimized OS version cos-105-17412-448-12 , the NVIDIA L4 has a Default GPU driver version of 535.183.01 , whereas the NVIDIA P100 has a Default GPU driver version of 470.256.02 .
- Restrictions Container-Optimized OS version restrictions Only Container-Optimized OS LTS release milestone 85 and later support the cos-extensions utility mentioned in the Installing NVIDIA GPU device drivers section.

Evidence snippets:
- A tiered testing setup like this should help to minimize issues when rolling out newer major versions of Container-Optimized OS images to your production environment.
- Milestones and Build Numbers Major versions of Container-Optimized OS images are identified using what we call milestones .
- The following table provides a summary of Container-Optimized OS releases available on Compute Engine: Active Milestones OS version Image project x86 image family Arm image family Built by End of support Release notes COS 133 DEV cos-cloud cos-dev cos-arm64-dev Google To Be Defined dev COS 129 BETA cos-cloud cos-beta cos-arm64-beta Google To Be Defined milestone 129 COS 125 LTS cos-cloud cos-125-lts cos-arm64-125-lts Google Sept 2027 milestone 125 COS 121 LTS cos-cloud cos-121-lts cos-arm64-121-lts Google March 2027 milestone 121 COS 117 LTS cos-cloud cos-117-lts cos-arm64-117-lts Google Sept 2026 milestone 117 COS 113 LTS cos-cloud cos-113-lts cos-arm64-113-lts Google March 2026 milestone 113 Deprecated Milestones OS version Image project x86 image family Arm image family Built by Deprecation date Release notes COS 109 LTS cos-cloud cos-109-lts cos-arm64-109-lts Google Sept 2025 milestone 109 COS 105 LTS cos-cloud cos-105-lts cos-arm64-105-lts Google March 2025 milestone 105 COS 101 LTS cos-cloud cos-101-lts N/A Google Oct 2024 milestone 101 COS 97 LTS cos-cloud cos-97-lts N/A Google April 2024 milestone 97 COS 93 LTS cos-cloud cos-93-lts N/A Google October 2023 milestone 93 COS 89 LTS cos-cloud cos-89-lts N/A Google March 2023 milestone 89 COS 85 LTS cos-cloud cos-85-lts N/A Google September 2022 milestone 85 COS 81 LTS cos-cloud cos-81-lts N/A Google September 2021 1 milestone 81 COS 77 LTS cos-cloud cos-77-lts N/A Google April 2021 1 milestone 77 COS 73 LTS cos-cloud cos-73-lts N/A Google June 2020 milestone 73 COS 69 LTS cos-cloud cos-69-lts N/A Google December 2019 milestone 69 COS 77 LTS and COS 81 LTS, when bundled with GKE, have slightly longer support durations.
- The lifecycle of a Container-Optimized OS LTS milestone looks as follows: Stage Duration Description Development 6 months Active development during which the milestone receives major package upgrades, new features.

### Using Cloud Logging with Container-Optimized OS \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Final score: 50
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The version of the containerized agent being run is defined in the Container-Optimized OS source app-admin/stackdriver directory .
- Known Limitations Compatibility with gcplogs driver Starting with milestone 89 , if the logging agent included with Container-Optimized OS is enabled and Docker gcplogs logging driver is enabled for one or more containers, excessive warning logs may be output by the included logging agent.
- However, if you have a custom logging configuration, you might experience breakage when migrating workloads to images that are based on a different architecture or to a newer version of Container-Optimized OS.
- For Arm images of all versions and x86 images for Container-Optimized OS 109 and later, the logging agent is a built-in OS package called fluent-bit .
