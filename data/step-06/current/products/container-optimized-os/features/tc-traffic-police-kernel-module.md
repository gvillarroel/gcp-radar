### "Running instances with GPU accelerators \_|\_ Container-Optimized OS \_\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/how-to/run-gpus](https://docs.cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/how-to/run-gpus)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 60
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, on a COS VM, you could use the following command to install the NVIDIA driver and load the nvidia.ko kernel module with the NVreg EnableGpuFirmware=0 parameter. sudo cos-extensions install gpu -- --module-arg nvidia.NVreg EnableGpuFirmware=0 Preload the driver You can preload the GPU driver on your Container-Optimized OS instance even when no GPU device is attached.
- Security Just like other kernel modules on Container-Optimized OS, GPU drivers are cryptographically signed and verified by keys that are built into the Container-Optimized OS kernel.
- Unlike some other distros, Container-Optimized OS does not allow users to enroll their Machine Owner Key (MOK) and use the keys to sign custom kernel modules.
- This is to ensure the integrity of the Container-Optimized OS kernel and reduce the attack surface.

### "Securing containers with AppArmor \_|\_ Container-Optimized OS \_|\_ Google\

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 55
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- You can also specify unconfined with the apparmor option to indicate that the container is to be run with no security profile, as in the following example: docker run --rm -it --security-opt apparmor=unconfined debian:jessie bash -i Viewing the active AppArmor security profiles You can see what AppArmor profile, if any, applies to the processes on your Container-Optimized OS instance by inspecting the /proc/<pid>/attr/current file, where <pid> is the process ID.
- To ensure that your custom security profile is present when your Container-Optimized OS instance boots, and remains persistent across reboots, you can use cloud-init to install the profile in /etc/apparmor.d .
- Home Documentation Compute Compute Engine Container-Optimized OS Guides Send feedback Securing containers with AppArmor Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- Using the default Docker AppArmor security profile When you start a container on your Container-Optimized OS instance, the system automatically applies the docker-default AppArmor security profile.

Evidence snippets:
- Security-hardened kernel Container-Optimized OS enables several security-hardening kernel features, including Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA), Audit, Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI), and some Linux Security Modules (LSMs) from Chromium OS.
- Testing and qualification process Before we publish a new Container-Optimized OS image to Google Cloud, we test it at multiple levels—including kernel fuzz testing by syzkaller , cluster-level Kubernetes tests, integration testing with Compute Engine features, and several performance benchmarks.
- Built from source at Google Each package in Container-Optimized OS, including the Linux kernel itself, is built from source from ChromiumOS code repositories.
- Infrastructure Security In addition to various hardening features in the OS itself, the Container-Optimized OS team also takes the software supply chain seriously and prioritizes infrastructure security when developing, building, and deploying images, based on years of experience from both Chromium OS and Google in general.
