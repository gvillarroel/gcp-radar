Evidence snippets:
- The following example shows you how to run a CUDA application in a Docker container that consumes /dev/nvidia0 : docker run \ --volume /var/lib/nvidia/lib64:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64 \ --volume /var/lib/nvidia/bin:/usr/local/nvidia/bin \ --device /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0 \ --device /dev/nvidia-uvm:/dev/nvidia-uvm \ --device /dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl \ registry.k8s.io/cuda-vector-add:v0.1 You can run your containers through cloud-init to specify the dependency between driver installation and your containers. see the End-to-end: Running a GPU application on Container-Optimized OS section for more details.
- For example, on a COS VM, you could use the following command to install the NVIDIA driver and load the nvidia.ko kernel module with the NVreg EnableGpuFirmware=0 parameter. sudo cos-extensions install gpu -- --module-arg nvidia.NVreg EnableGpuFirmware=0 Preload the driver You can preload the GPU driver on your Container-Optimized OS instance even when no GPU device is attached.
- Security Just like other kernel modules on Container-Optimized OS, GPU drivers are cryptographically signed and verified by keys that are built into the Container-Optimized OS kernel.
- Verify the installation You can run the following commands on your Container-Optimized OS VM instances to manually verify the installation of the GPU drivers.

- Final score: 38
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Container-Optimized OS may not be the right choice for you in the following cases: Your application is not containerized or your containerized application depends on kernel modules, drivers and other additional packages that are not available in Container-Optimized OS.
- The Container-Optimized OS kernel is locked down; you'll be unable to install third-party kernel modules or drivers.
- Limitations Container-Optimized OS has limited or no support for some of the common features you may be familiar with on other operating systems: Container-Optimized OS does not include a package manager; as such, you'll be unable to install software packages directly on an instance.
- Features and Benefits Container-Optimized OS provides the following benefits: Run Containers Out of the Box : Container-Optimized OS instances come pre-installed with the Docker and containerd runtimes and cloud-init .

### Using Cloud Logging with Container-Optimized OS \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/how-to/logging](https://docs.cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/how-to/logging)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 35
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Known Limitations Compatibility with gcplogs driver Starting with milestone 89 , if the logging agent included with Container-Optimized OS is enabled and Docker gcplogs logging driver is enabled for one or more containers, excessive warning logs may be output by the included logging agent.
- A workaround is to not use gcplogs as a Docker logging driver, and to instead use the default driver as configured by Container-Optimized OS.
- The docker command that starts the logging agent is defined in the Container-Optimized OS source for stackdriver-logging systemd service .
- The version of the containerized agent being run is defined in the Container-Optimized OS source app-admin/stackdriver directory .
