- This level includes recommendations such as the following: Firewall rules exist for all open ports ICMP redirects and router advertisements are not accepted Default user shell timeout is 900 seconds or less How Container-Optimized OS complies with the CIS Benchmarks Starting with Milestone 97 , Container-Optimized OS images comply with to CIS Level 1 by default and provide an option to comply with CIS Level 2.
- Periodic checking of CIS compliance status Container-Optimized OS images include the following services to periodically check CIS compliance: cis-compliance-scanner.service : checks the compliance status based on environment variables defined at /etc/cis-scanner/env vars .
- Home Documentation Compute Compute Engine Container-Optimized OS Guides Send feedback Configuring and Checking CIS Compliance Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- This document explains what the CIS Benchmark is, how the benchmark relates to Container-Optimized OS (COS), how to audit the status of compliance in the instance and how to troubleshoot in case of failure.

Evidence snippets:
- End-to-end: Running a GPU application on Container-Optimized OS The following end-to-end example shows you how to use cloud-init to configure Container-Optimized OS VM instances that provision a GPU application container myapp:latest after the GPU driver has been installed: #cloud-config users : - name : myuser uid : 2000 write files : - path : /etc/systemd/system/install-gpu.service permissions : 0644 owner : root content : [Unit] Description=Install GPU drivers Wants=gcr-online.target docker.socket After=gcr-online.target docker.socket [Service] User=root Type=oneshot ExecStart=cos-extensions install gpu StandardOutput=journal+console StandardError=journal+console - path : /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service permissions : 0644 owner : root content : [Unit] Description=Run a myapp GPU application container Requires=install-gpu.service After=install-gpu.service [Service] User=root Type=oneshot RemainAfterExit=true ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm -u 2000 --name=myapp --device /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0 myapp:latest StandardOutput=journal+console StandardError=journal+console runcmd : - systemctl daemon-reload - systemctl start install-gpu.service - systemctl start myapp.service About the NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries CUDA® is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model for GPUs.
- The following example shows you how to run a CUDA application in a Docker container that consumes /dev/nvidia0 : docker run \ --volume /var/lib/nvidia/lib64:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64 \ --volume /var/lib/nvidia/bin:/usr/local/nvidia/bin \ --device /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0 \ --device /dev/nvidia-uvm:/dev/nvidia-uvm \ --device /dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl \ registry.k8s.io/cuda-vector-add:v0.1 You can run your containers through cloud-init to specify the dependency between driver installation and your containers. see the End-to-end: Running a GPU application on Container-Optimized OS section for more details.
- For example, on a COS VM, you could use the following command to install the NVIDIA driver and load the nvidia.ko kernel module with the NVreg EnableGpuFirmware=0 parameter. sudo cos-extensions install gpu -- --module-arg nvidia.NVreg EnableGpuFirmware=0 Preload the driver You can preload the GPU driver on your Container-Optimized OS instance even when no GPU device is attached.
- You may also check all the GPU driver versions supported by the GPU on your Container-Optimized OS VM instance by running the following command: sudo cos-extensions list Identify the required CUDA toolkit version If your applications use CUDA , install NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit in your containers.

### Using Cloud Logging with Container-Optimized OS \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 36
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Known Limitations Compatibility with gcplogs driver Starting with milestone 89 , if the logging agent included with Container-Optimized OS is enabled and Docker gcplogs logging driver is enabled for one or more containers, excessive warning logs may be output by the included logging agent.
- A workaround is to not use gcplogs as a Docker logging driver, and to instead use the default driver as configured by Container-Optimized OS.
- The docker command that starts the logging agent is defined in the Container-Optimized OS source for stackdriver-logging systemd service .
- The version of the containerized agent being run is defined in the Container-Optimized OS source app-admin/stackdriver directory .
