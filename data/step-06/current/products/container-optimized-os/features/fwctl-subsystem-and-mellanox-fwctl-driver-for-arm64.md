Evidence snippets:
- You can also see all available releases on command line by running the following command: gcloud compute images list --project cos-cloud --no-standard-images --filter = "name 'cos-arm64- '" The output is similar to the following: NAME PROJECT FAMILY DEPRECATED STATUS cos-arm64-101-17162-40-5 cos-cloud cos-arm64-101-lts READY cos-arm64-beta-101-17162-40-5 cos-cloud cos-arm64-beta READY cos-arm64-dev-105-17228-0-0 cos-cloud cos-arm64-dev READY cos-arm64-stable-101-17162-40-5 cos-cloud cos-arm64-stable READY Arm-based Container-Optimized OS images share the same versioning scheme and LTS milestone lifecycle with x86-based images.
- There are also similar image families cos-arm64-dev , cos-arm64-beta , cos-arm64-stable and cos-arm64-[MILESTONE]-lts for Arm-based Container-Optimized OS images.
- View Arm-based images Arm-based Container-Optimized OS images are hosted under the cos-cloud project with the prefix cos-arm64 .

Evidence snippets:
- Working with the Container-Optimized OS file system The following is a list of paths in the Container-Optimized OS node image file system, along with their properties and recommended usage: Path Properties Purpose / read-only executable The root filesystem is mounted as read-only to maintain integrity.
- Home Documentation Compute Compute Engine Container-Optimized OS Guides Send feedback Disks and file system overview Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- When using Container-Optimized OS, be aware of the partitioning if you run your own services that have certain expectations about the file system layout outside of containers.
- Since /etc/ is stateless on Container-Optimized OS, you cannot use /etc/fstab to automatically fsck (file system consistency check) and mount the disks on boot.

Evidence snippets:
- End-to-end: Running a GPU application on Container-Optimized OS The following end-to-end example shows you how to use cloud-init to configure Container-Optimized OS VM instances that provision a GPU application container myapp:latest after the GPU driver has been installed: #cloud-config users : - name : myuser uid : 2000 write files : - path : /etc/systemd/system/install-gpu.service permissions : 0644 owner : root content : [Unit] Description=Install GPU drivers Wants=gcr-online.target docker.socket After=gcr-online.target docker.socket [Service] User=root Type=oneshot ExecStart=cos-extensions install gpu StandardOutput=journal+console StandardError=journal+console - path : /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service permissions : 0644 owner : root content : [Unit] Description=Run a myapp GPU application container Requires=install-gpu.service After=install-gpu.service [Service] User=root Type=oneshot RemainAfterExit=true ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm -u 2000 --name=myapp --device /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0 myapp:latest StandardOutput=journal+console StandardError=journal+console runcmd : - systemctl daemon-reload - systemctl start install-gpu.service - systemctl start myapp.service About the NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries CUDA® is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model for GPUs.
- The following example shows you how to run a CUDA application in a Docker container that consumes /dev/nvidia0 : docker run \ --volume /var/lib/nvidia/lib64:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64 \ --volume /var/lib/nvidia/bin:/usr/local/nvidia/bin \ --device /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0 \ --device /dev/nvidia-uvm:/dev/nvidia-uvm \ --device /dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl \ registry.k8s.io/cuda-vector-add:v0.1 You can run your containers through cloud-init to specify the dependency between driver installation and your containers. see the End-to-end: Running a GPU application on Container-Optimized OS section for more details.
- For example, on a COS VM, you could use the following command to install the NVIDIA driver and load the nvidia.ko kernel module with the NVreg EnableGpuFirmware=0 parameter. sudo cos-extensions install gpu -- --module-arg nvidia.NVreg EnableGpuFirmware=0 Preload the driver You can preload the GPU driver on your Container-Optimized OS instance even when no GPU device is attached.
- You may also check all the GPU driver versions supported by the GPU on your Container-Optimized OS VM instance by running the following command: sudo cos-extensions list Identify the required CUDA toolkit version If your applications use CUDA , install NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit in your containers.
