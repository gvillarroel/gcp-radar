Evidence snippets:
- Infrastructure Security In addition to various hardening features in the OS itself, the Container-Optimized OS team also takes the software supply chain seriously and prioritizes infrastructure security when developing, building, and deploying images, based on years of experience from both Chromium OS and Google in general.
- Testing and qualification process Before we publish a new Container-Optimized OS image to Google Cloud, we test it at multiple levels—including kernel fuzz testing by syzkaller , cluster-level Kubernetes tests, integration testing with Compute Engine features, and several performance benchmarks.
- Filesystem The following is a list of paths in the Container-Optimized OS node image file system, along with their properties and recommended usage: Path Properties Purpose / read-only executable The root filesystem is mounted as read-only to maintain integrity.
- Security-hardened kernel Container-Optimized OS enables several security-hardening kernel features, including Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA), Audit, Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI), and some Linux Security Modules (LSMs) from Chromium OS.
