Evidence snippets:
- Create an APEX REST class Although your code will be different, please see the below example: @RestResource ( urlmapping = '/searchVIP' ) global class UjetVIPSearch { @httpPOST global static void searchVIP () { RestRequest req = RestContext . request ; RestResponse res = RestContext . response ; responsewrapper response = new responsewrapper (); try { requestWrapper jsonBody ; jsonBody = ( requestWrapper ) JSON . deserialize ( req . requestBody . toString (), requestWrapper . class ); String aninumber = jsonBody . phone ; // CCAI Platform will send phone parameter in format % 222 % 333 % 4444 if ( string . isNotBlank ( aninumber )) { integer cnt = [ SELECT count() from Contact where Contact.Phone like :aninumber AND VIP c = true ] ; response . is vip = ( cnt > 0 ); res . responseBody = blob . valueof ( JSON . serialize ( response )); } else { res . statuscode = 404 ; res . responseBody = blob . valueof ( 'No Contact found' ); } } catch ( exception e ) { res . statuscode = 500 ; res . responseBody = blob . valueof ( e . getmessage ()); } } public class responsewrapper { public boolean is vip ; } public class requestWrapper { public string phone ; } } Modify security Since the Apex REST class will be accessed by the agent's OAuth token, you will need to add all applicable agent profiles into the "Enabled Profiles" column.

- CRM sends agent status update When Agent is not Offline in CCAI Platform, CRM status changes will be made in CCAI Platform based on status mapping When Agent is in Offline in CCAI Platform, CRM status changes will be ignored When the CRM status changes while on an active session/call CCAI Platform treats this status change the same as the agent Next Status feature and when the session is complete, after Wrap-up, the next status is governed by the new CRM status If the agent has defined their Next Status and a CRM status change request is also received, the agent's next status will be set to the latest received status Salesforce Configuration Configure omni-channel If your org has already configured Omni-Channel, skip this section.
- Feedback: when enabled, shows customer feedback collected during session on record Case: case the session object is attached to Initial menu selected: initial queue menu selected Materialized menu path: the selected path leading to connection with the agent Language: the language used or selected for the session Outbound phone number -- applicable outbound phone number Status: status of the session Total transfers: number of total transfers during the session Files All media files associated with the session object are attached as files to the session object.
