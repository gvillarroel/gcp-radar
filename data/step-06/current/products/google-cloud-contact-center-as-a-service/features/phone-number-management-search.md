Evidence snippets:
- Create an APEX REST class Although your code will be different, please see the below example: @RestResource ( urlmapping = '/searchVIP' ) global class UjetVIPSearch { @httpPOST global static void searchVIP () { RestRequest req = RestContext . request ; RestResponse res = RestContext . response ; responsewrapper response = new responsewrapper (); try { requestWrapper jsonBody ; jsonBody = ( requestWrapper ) JSON . deserialize ( req . requestBody . toString (), requestWrapper . class ); String aninumber = jsonBody . phone ; // CCAI Platform will send phone parameter in format % 222 % 333 % 4444 if ( string . isNotBlank ( aninumber )) { integer cnt = [ SELECT count() from Contact where Contact.Phone like :aninumber AND VIP c = true ] ; response . is vip = ( cnt > 0 ); res . responseBody = blob . valueof ( JSON . serialize ( response )); } else { res . statuscode = 404 ; res . responseBody = blob . valueof ( 'No Contact found' ); } } catch ( exception e ) { res . statuscode = 500 ; res . responseBody = blob . valueof ( e . getmessage ()); } } public class responsewrapper { public boolean is vip ; } public class requestWrapper { public string phone ; } } Modify security Since the Apex REST class will be accessed by the agent's OAuth token, you will need to add all applicable agent profiles into the "Enabled Profiles" column.

- No cases will be created CRM data impacting the Agent experience Number of contacts with the same phone number No Contact with phone number Only one Contact with phone number Multiple Contacts with phone number Number of open cases No Case Only one Case Multiple Cases Placing an outbound call Dialed outbound call Placing a call by syncing with the current page in Salesforce From Salesforce, navigate to a Case, Contact, Account, or Lead.
