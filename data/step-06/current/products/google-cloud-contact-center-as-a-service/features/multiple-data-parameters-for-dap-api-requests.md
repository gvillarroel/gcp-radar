Evidence snippets:
- Details and tips Due to the number of digits on a keypad, there's a 9 top-level queue menu limit If you need to more than 9 queues, nest more queues within a top-level queue All numbers assigned to your environment will default to the top of the queue unless otherwise assigned as Direct Access points (DAPs) If you are using multiple languages, numbers will default to the language selection message, then when the language is selected, will route to the top of the menu structure for the selected language If you want to hide a queue from a caller who dials into a number that goes to the top of the queue, toggle the Hide Selection From Menu option to Hide in the menu settings For internal transfers to teams or groups not available to callers, create one queue, hide the option from callers, and create all the necessary sub-queues for agents to pick from for transfers Once your queues are set up, you can see the numbers that the caller needs to select.
- Hidden queues can be accessed using Direct Access Points (DAPs) .
- See Direct Access Points (DAPs) .
