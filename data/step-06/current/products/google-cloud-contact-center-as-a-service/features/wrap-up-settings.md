Evidence snippets:
- April 25, 2023 Feature Queue-level wrap-up settings : You can now customize wrap-up times for different queues, to ensure that agents have adequate time to complete their tasks without compromising service level agreements or taking another call/chat before they are ready.
- If a top-level queue has no available leaf queues or is incorrectly configured, the IVR fallback will redirect the caller to the previous queue (if human agents are available) or provide an error message before disconnecting (if the top-level queue has no available agents).To enable this feature: Enter the top-level queue ID in the Dialogflow destination (you can find parent queue IDs in the Virtual Agent queue menu settings).
- Feature Configure wrap-up separately for inbound and outbound calls You can now configure wrap-up separately for inbound and outbound calls, both globally and at the queue level.
- Fixed an issue where the French Canadian translation for "wrap-up" was inconsistent between the chat adapter and notes panel.
