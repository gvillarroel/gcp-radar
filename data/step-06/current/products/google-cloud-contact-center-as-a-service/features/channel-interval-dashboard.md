- If the number is blocked, and the caller is calling into a UK number from a phone number with a US country code, the callback won't take place since there will be an incorrect number stored for the caller [UK +44 (extracted from inbound IVR number + consumer entered number].
- Timeout behavior : If the caller selects the callback option and the queue goes into after hours before the call is answered, the caller waits until the call times out based on the Unanswered Call Expiration set on the same Call Settings page.
- To assign multiple direct phone numbers to an agent, follow the instructions in Bulk user management: Upload new or updated users while following these guidelines: Stay within the limitations for assigning direct phone numbers.

- Details and tips Due to the number of digits on a keypad, there's a 9 top-level queue menu limit If you need to more than 9 queues, nest more queues within a top-level queue All numbers assigned to your environment will default to the top of the queue unless otherwise assigned as Direct Access points (DAPs) If you are using multiple languages, numbers will default to the language selection message, then when the language is selected, will route to the top of the menu structure for the selected language If you want to hide a queue from a caller who dials into a number that goes to the top of the queue, toggle the Hide Selection From Menu option to Hide in the menu settings For internal transfers to teams or groups not available to callers, create one queue, hide the option from callers, and create all the necessary sub-queues for agents to pick from for transfers Once your queues are set up, you can see the numbers that the caller needs to select.
- Emails will have the end-user's entered email address in the Reply-to Header field All emails will use this subject format: {Queue Name} [from: {email} ] Your CRM team should set up a rule that identifies the email address in the subject or body of the email and use the email address to identify the contact for the best experience Once enabled, the email form with the custom email per-queue shows at all times for the email channel, including: during operation hours, after operation hours, and for email deflection options CCAI Platform portal sends to the email address specified and then inbound emails are handled by your email provider.
