Evidence snippets:
- For example, since outbound calls do not have an introduction message, you can have the call recording play for consumers before the consent to record (user permission) so they know who is calling (call recording).
- Example use cases: Show order details for a specific user via Mobile or Web queues Present your users with product offerings based on their locations by directing to a specialized web page based on user ID Mobile FAQ page landing can be personalized to show the right page for the user's membership tier based on the User ID Feature details If mobile or Web SDK passes User ID/identifier to CCAI Platform portal, it can be inserted as a session variable into your manual deflection webpage or FAQ link From the Admin Portal, an admin can add "@@USER ID@@" into the URL in Manual Deflection to Webpage field under Mobile or Web queues to dynamically retrieve and insert User ID From the Admin Portal, an admin can add "@@USER ID@@" into the URL for Mobile FAQ to dynamically retrieve and insert UID CCAI Platform portal configuration Automatic redirect Go to Settings > Queue > Mobile OR Web .
- Play Ask Permission to Record Message before Call Recording Message Play Call Recording Message before Ask Permission to Record Message Note: Recording message and Ask Permission to Record messages are played in the configured order for: Callback outbound calls - if the queue is configured for asking to record.
- Keep the following in mind: Incoming SMS phone numbers can be assigned to only one queue (a queue can have multiple incoming numbers as long as they are not used for any other queue.) Outbound SMS phone numbers can be assigned to any number of queues and a queue can have any number of outbound phone numbers.
