Evidence snippets:
- Details and tips Due to the number of digits on a keypad, there's a 9 top-level queue menu limit If you need to more than 9 queues, nest more queues within a top-level queue All numbers assigned to your environment will default to the top of the queue unless otherwise assigned as Direct Access points (DAPs) If you are using multiple languages, numbers will default to the language selection message, then when the language is selected, will route to the top of the menu structure for the selected language If you want to hide a queue from a caller who dials into a number that goes to the top of the queue, toggle the Hide Selection From Menu option to Hide in the menu settings For internal transfers to teams or groups not available to callers, create one queue, hide the option from callers, and create all the necessary sub-queues for agents to pick from for transfers Once your queues are set up, you can see the numbers that the caller needs to select.
- Any agents assigned to the queue can use any of the outbound phone numbers; therefore, If you want an agent to have their own number, they must have their own leaf queue.
- Feature details Only agents assigned to calls from or to queues that have been specifically enabled will see the option to redact calls Calls initiated from an enabled queue that are transferred to a queue without call redaction enabled will not have the call redaction feature available Agents need to manually initiate and end the redaction Agents will still be able to hear during the redacted section of the call while on the live call Admin portal configuration Enable call redaction for inbound calls Go to Settings > Queue .
- Details At least one agent must be assigned to a call/chat queue for the queue to be enabled Agents can only be assigned to a leaf queue, so if there is a sub-queue associated, agents must be assigned to one of the sub-queues Queue menus are set up and ready to use when the color turns from red to white If enabling multiple languages, see Enabling Multiple Languages Assign agents to the IVR channel Go to Settings > Queue.
