- Details and tips Due to the number of digits on a keypad, there's a 9 top-level queue menu limit If you need to more than 9 queues, nest more queues within a top-level queue All numbers assigned to your environment will default to the top of the queue unless otherwise assigned as Direct Access points (DAPs) If you are using multiple languages, numbers will default to the language selection message, then when the language is selected, will route to the top of the menu structure for the selected language If you want to hide a queue from a caller who dials into a number that goes to the top of the queue, toggle the Hide Selection From Menu option to Hide in the menu settings For internal transfers to teams or groups not available to callers, create one queue, hide the option from callers, and create all the necessary sub-queues for agents to pick from for transfers Once your queues are set up, you can see the numbers that the caller needs to select.
- EWT for calls For calls, EWT is calculated based on the following formula: EWT = ((average duration in channel / active agents in channel) (agents in common / active agents in current queue) (queued calls - available agents)) + {EWT for callbacks, campaign calls, and scheduled calls} EWT for chats For chats, EWT is calculated based on the following formula: EWT = (average duration in channel / active agents in channel) (agents in common / active agents in current queue) (queued chats - available agents) Note: In chat channels, the value for active agents includes a multiplier based on the chat concurrency if the chat concurrency is >1.
