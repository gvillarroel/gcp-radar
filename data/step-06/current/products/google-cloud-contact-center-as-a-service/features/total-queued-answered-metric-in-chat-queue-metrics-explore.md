- EWT for calls For calls, EWT is calculated based on the following formula: EWT = ((average duration in channel / active agents in channel) (agents in common / active agents in current queue) (queued calls - available agents)) + {EWT for callbacks, campaign calls, and scheduled calls} EWT for chats For chats, EWT is calculated based on the following formula: EWT = (average duration in channel / active agents in channel) (agents in common / active agents in current queue) (queued chats - available agents) Note: In chat channels, the value for active agents includes a multiplier based on the chat concurrency if the chat concurrency is >1.
- Global target metrics Target metrics set at the global level on the Settings > Operation Management page will continue to be inherited by all queues by default.
- Queue level target metrics Overview In addition to the global settings for target metrics, for further granularity, you can set queue-specific target metrics.
