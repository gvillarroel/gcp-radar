- It applies to all chat types and the following chat flows: Transfers Chats routed through Direct Access Points (DAPs) Queues with cascade groups enabled Queues with percent allocation groups enabled Eligible agents To receive a deltacast call, an agent must fulfill one of following requirements: Status is set to Available.
- Deltacast for calls If enabled, deltacast extends to the following: Transfers Scheduled calls Calls routed using Direct Access Points (DAPs) Queues with cascade groups enabled Queues with percent allocation groups This section outlines deltacast routing logic and describes how to enable this feature.
- If no agents pick up the chat and the cascade group timer expires: The chat is offered using multicast to all eligible agents in Cascade Group B, and continues to offer the chat using multicast to all eligible agents in Cascade Group A.
- If no agents pick up the chat and the cascade group timer expires: The chat is offered using multicast to all agents in Cascade Group A in either Available and In-Chat status, including the original agent routed the chat.

- Details and tips Due to the number of digits on a keypad, there's a 9 top-level queue menu limit If you need to more than 9 queues, nest more queues within a top-level queue All numbers assigned to your environment will default to the top of the queue unless otherwise assigned as Direct Access points (DAPs) If you are using multiple languages, numbers will default to the language selection message, then when the language is selected, will route to the top of the menu structure for the selected language If you want to hide a queue from a caller who dials into a number that goes to the top of the queue, toggle the Hide Selection From Menu option to Hide in the menu settings For internal transfers to teams or groups not available to callers, create one queue, hide the option from callers, and create all the necessary sub-queues for agents to pick from for transfers Once your queues are set up, you can see the numbers that the caller needs to select.
- Queue menus can be set to route to a specific group of agents, deflect to messages, other queues, phone numbers, or voicemail, and many features can be applied at the queue level for specific customization.

Evidence snippets:
- When scheduled calls are enabled for queues with Cascade groups : If available, an agent from the highest level group will be assigned the calls first, then the next group in the standard routing order.
- If no agents are available to be assigned, the call will wait in queue and the first available agent from any cascade group will be assigned.
- This feature is configured at the IVR queue level and can be offered to callers conditionally based on the estimated wait times.
- Some of these settings can also be configured at the queue level, but they must first be configured globally.
