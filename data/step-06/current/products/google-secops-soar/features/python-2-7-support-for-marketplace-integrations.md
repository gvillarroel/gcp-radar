- For example, the following JSON object represents a poor structure as it would be unusable inside playbooks: { "10.10.10.10": { "is malicious": "false" } } Instead, format it like this: [ { "is malicious": "false", "ip": "10.10.10.10" } ] If you're using entities inside the action and return results Per Entity, then the best practice is to structure the JSON Result like this: [ { "Entity": "10.10.10.10", "EntityResult": { "is malicious": "false", } } ] Always consider how the output of the action can be used inside automation.

- In general, the structure of the name should be like this: {integration display name} - {process} Job For example: ServiceNow - Sync Incidents Job Description The Description of the job should highlight to the user what the job is doing during the iterations; for example, This job will synchronize Security Command Center based cases created by the Urgent Posture Findings connector.
