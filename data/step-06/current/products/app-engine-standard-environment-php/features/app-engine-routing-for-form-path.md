# App Engine routing for /form path

Product: App Engine standard environment PHP
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

The URL path /form is now allowed and is forwarded to applications.

## Extended Definition

The URL path /form is now allowed and is forwarded to applications.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

Evidence snippets:
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- When you have entered a value into each field, the equivalent YAML configuration for this custom constraint appears on the right. gcloud To create a custom constraint, create a YAML file using the following format: name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/ CONSTRAINT NAME resourceTypes : RESOURCE NAME methodTypes : - CREATE condition : " CONDITION " actionType : ACTION displayName : DISPLAY NAME description : DESCRIPTION Replace the following: ORGANIZATION ID : your organization ID, such as 123456789 .
- Create a connector using an existing subnet : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create CONNECTOR NAME \ --region REGION \ --subnet SUBNET NAME \ --subnet-project HOST PROJECT ID \ --min-instances MIN \ --max-instances MAX \ --machine-type MACHINE TYPE Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : a name for your connector, matching Compute Engine naming conventions , with the additional requirements that the name must be less than 21 characters long, and that hyphens (-) count as two characters.
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.

Evidence snippets:
- A low maximum means App Engine will start new instances sooner for pending requests, improving performance but raising running costs.
- Everything after the end of the matched url pattern is appended to static dir to form the full path to the requested file.
- For more information about App Engine specific headers, see Request headers and responses .
- Example The following is an example of an app.yaml file: runtime : python314 instance class : F2 env variables : BUCKET NAME : "example-gcs-bucket" handlers : Matches requests to /images/... to files in static/images/... - url : /images static dir : static/images - url : /. secure : always redirect http response code : 301 script : auto The following table provides YAML examples of available fields in an app.yaml file: Runtime and app elements Element Description app engine apis Optional.
