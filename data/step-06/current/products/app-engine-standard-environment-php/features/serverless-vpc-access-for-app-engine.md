Evidence snippets:
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- Create an egress firewall rule on your Serverless VPC Access connector to prevent it from sending outgoing traffic, with the exception of established responses, to any destination. gcloud compute firewall-rules create RULE NAME \ --action = DENY \ --rules = PROTOCOL \ --direction = EGRESS \ --target-tags = VPC CONNECTOR NETWORK TAG \ --network = VPC NETWORK \ --priority = PRIORITY Replace the following: RULE NAME : the name of your new firewall rule.
- This overrides the implicit firewall rule that Serverless VPC Access creates on your VPC network by default. gcloud compute firewall-rules create RULE NAME \ --action = DENY \ --rules = PROTOCOL \ --source-ranges = VPC CONNECTOR CIDR RANGE \ --direction = INGRESS \ --network = VPC NETWORK \ --priority = PRIORITY Replace the following: RULE NAME : the name of your new firewall rule.

Evidence snippets:
- Route the traffic over a Serverless VPC Access connector : For each App Engine version sending private traffic to other app endpoints, attach the version to a Serverless VPC Access connector belonging to one of the Google Cloud project's own networks, not a Shared VPC network.
- Configure the client app to send all-traffic through the Serverless VPC Access connector, instead of configuring requests to use the private.googleapis.com IP range.
- In the standard environment, attach each client version to a Serverless VPC Access connector on the Shared VPC network.
- Ensure Private Google Access is enabled for the subnet used by the Serverless VPC Access connector.

Evidence snippets:
- Note that routing all outbound requests to your VPC network increases the amount of egress handled by the Serverless VPC Access connector and can incur charges .
- By default, only requests to internal IP addresses and internal DNS names are routed through a Serverless VPC Access connector.
- Using the urlfetch library ignores egress settings, and requests will not route through a Serverless VPC Access connector.
- If you use Serverless VPC Access , you can specify the egress setting for your App Engine service.
