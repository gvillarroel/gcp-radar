Evidence snippets:
- In App Engine, there are a few separate use cases for setting up access control: Granting team members access to your Google Cloud project so they can set up services and deploy apps.
- Client () Make an authenticated API request buckets = list ( storage client . list buckets ()) print ( buckets ) Ruby project id = "Your Google Cloud project ID" require "google/cloud/storage" If you don't specify credentials when constructing the client, the client library will look for credentials in the environment. storage = Google :: Cloud :: Storage . new project : project id Make an authenticated API request storage . buckets . each do bucket puts bucket . name end By default, the app's environment contains credentials from the default App Engine service account .
- Granting access to team members To give a developer access to your Google Cloud project, create one or both of the following: A user account , which is associated with a Google account and is intended to represent a specific individual on your project.
