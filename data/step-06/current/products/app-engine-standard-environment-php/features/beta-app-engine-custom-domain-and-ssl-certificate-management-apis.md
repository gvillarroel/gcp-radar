Evidence snippets:
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
- Updating DNS records at your domain registrar Note: If you have a custom domain set up for your App Engine app and want to move it to a different Google Cloud project, you do not need to update your custom domain DNS records as these will remain fixed for the domain when you switch projects.
- Deleting custom domains from your app In order to delete a custom domain mapping from your app, your account must have the App Engine Admin role ( roles/appengine.appAdmin ) or a custom role that contains the appengine.applications.update permission.
- The regions are as follows: us-west2 us-east4 northamerica-northeast1 southamerica-east1 europe-west2 europe-west3 asia-south1 asia-northeast1 australia-southeast1 App Engine custom domains use a pool of shared IP addresses for all applications.

- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- To perform these steps, you must have one of the following roles on the host project: Owner role ( roles/owner ) Compute Security Admin role ( roles/compute.securityAdmin ) Custom Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the compute.firewalls.create permission enabled For a basic configuration, apply the rules to allow serverless resources in any service project connected to the Shared VPC network to send requests to any resource in the network.
- You must have one of the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles: Compute Security Admin role Custom IAM role with the compute.firewalls.create permission enabled Deny connector traffic across your VPC network.
