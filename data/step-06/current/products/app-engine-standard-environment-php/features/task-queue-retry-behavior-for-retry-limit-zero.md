# Task queue retry behavior for retry_limit zero

Product: App Engine standard environment PHP
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

Failed tasks in queues with a retry_limit of zero are no longer retried.

## Extended Definition

Failed tasks in queues with a retry_limit of zero are no longer retried.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If you also specify job retry limit , App Engine retries the cron job until it reaches both limits. min backoff seconds The minimum number of seconds to wait before retrying a cron job after it fails. max backoff seconds The maximum number of seconds to wait before retrying a cron job after it fails. max doublings The maximum number of times that the interval between failed cron job retries will be doubled before the increase becomes constant.
- The default value for job retry limit is 0 . job age limit The time limit for retrying a failed cron job, measured from when the cron job first runs.
- Element Description job retry limit An integer that represents the maximum number of retry attempts for a failed cron job.
- For example, if the /tasks/hello service2 URL is defined in both of the following cron.yaml and dispatch.yaml files, the job requests are sent to service2 , even though target: service1 is specified: cron.yaml : cron : - description : "test dispatch vs target" url : /tasks/hello service2 schedule : every 1 mins target : service1 dispatch.yaml : dispatch : - url : ' /tasks/hello service2' service : service2 retry parameters Optional.

Evidence snippets:
- If your application interacts with Datastore or Task Queues operations, set up monitoring to monitor performance and behavior impacts after enabling this feature. <system-properties> <property name="appengine.use.httpconnector" value="true"/> </system-properties> Optional.
- It's possible to reduce request latency by configuring your application to asynchronously write HTTP session data to the Datastore: <async-session-persistence enabled="true" /> With async session persistence turned on, App Engine will submit a Task Queue task to write session data to the Datastore before writing the data to memcache.
- You will need to test your application and expected traffic volume to determine the ideal number of instances to keep in reserve. <min-pending-latency> The minimum amount of time in seconds that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting a new instance to handle it.
- However, you won't be charged for more instances than the maximum number you've specified. <max-pending-latency> The maximum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting additional instances to handle requests so that pending latency is reduced.
