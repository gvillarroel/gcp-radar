- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas](https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-4`
- Final score: 82
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For resources that are required to initiate a request, when the resource is depleted, App Engine by default returns an HTTP 403 or 503 error code for the request instead of calling a request handler.
- Resource Daily limit Maximum rate UrlFetch API calls 860,000,000 calls 660,000 calls/minute UrlFetch data sent 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute UrlFetch data received 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute Networking limits The following networking limits apply to App Engine: Outbound connections per second per instance: 500 (cannot be increased) Outbound DNS resolutions per second per instance: 100 (cannot be increased) Maximum packets per second per instance: 80,000 Maximum bits per second per instance: 100,000,000 Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- The following example illustrates how to catch the OverQuotaError , which may be raised by the SendMessage() method if an email-related quota has been exceeded: try: mail.SendMessage ( to = 'test@example.com' , from = 'admin@example.com' , subject = 'Test Email' , body = 'Testing' ) except apiproxy errors.OverQuotaError, message: Log the error. logging.error(message) Display an informative message to the user. self.response.out.write ( 'The email could not be sent. ' 'Please try again later.' ) Is your app exceeding the default limits?
- This includes: data received by the application in secure requests and non-secure requests uploads to the Blobstore data received in response to HTTP requests by the URL fetch service Secure outgoing bandwidth The amount of data sent by the application over a secure connection in response to requests.

### "How requests are handled \_|\_ App Engine standard environment \_|\_ Google\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/how-requests-are-handled](https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/how-requests-are-handled)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 72
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- All subsequent requests for this URL that contain the Accept-Encoding: gzip header will receive the gzipped data from the cache until the cache becomes invalidated (due to the content changing after the cache expires).
- Response headers that exceed this limit will return HTTP 502 errors, with logs showing upstream sent too big header while reading response header from upstream .
- All subsequent requests for this URL that don't contain the Accept-Encoding header receive uncompressed data from the cache until the cache becomes invalidated.
- If a script handler generates a response larger than this limit, the server sends back an empty response with a 500 Internal Server Error status code.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 68
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
- Errors Service account needs Service Agent role error If you use the Restrict Resource Service Usage organization policy constraint to block Cloud Deployment Manager ( deploymentmanager.googleapis.com ), you might see the following error message: Serverless VPC Access service account (service-<PROJECT NUMBER>@gcp-sa-vpcaccess.iam.gserviceaccount.com) needs Serverless VPC Access Service Agent role in the project.
- DESCRIPTION : a human-friendly description of the constraint to display as an error message when the policy is violated, for example, "Require network to not be set to default." This field has a maximum length of 2000 characters.
- Connection refused error If you receive connection refused or connection timeout errors that degrade network performance, your connections could be growing without limit across invocations of your serverless application.
