- Custom menus in Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms Apps Script can add new menus in Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms, with each menu item tied to a function in a script. (In Forms, custom menus are visible only to an editor who opens the form to modify it, not to a user who opens the form to respond.) Only bound scripts can create menus.
- The most common example is running a script from a custom menu item in Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, or Google Forms, but script functions can also be triggered by clicking on images and drawings in Sheets.
