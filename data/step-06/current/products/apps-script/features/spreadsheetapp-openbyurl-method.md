### Custom Functions in Google Sheets \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 108
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- This means that a custom function written in one spreadsheet can't be used in other spreadsheets unless you use one of the following methods: Click Extensions > Apps Script to open the script editor, then copy the script text from the original spreadsheet and paste it into the script editor of another spreadsheet.
- Cannot open other spreadsheets ( SpreadsheetApp.openById() or SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl() ).
- If you use the getValue method in custom functions, be aware that the referenced range isn't directly passed as an argument to the custom function.
- For example, the DOUBLE() function shown earlier can be rewritten to accept a single cell or range of cells as follows: / Multiplies the input value by 2. @param {number Array<Array<number>>} input The value or range of cells to multiply. @return The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return Array . isArray ( input ) ? input . map ( row = > row . map ( cell = > cell 2 )) : input 2 ; } This approach uses the map method of JavaScript's Array object on the two-dimensional array of cells to get each row, then for each row, it uses map again to return double each cell's value.

### Custom Menus in Google Workspace \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/menus](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/menus)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 80
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For more information on the types of dialogs you can open, see the guide to dialogs and sidebars . function onOpen () { const ui = SpreadsheetApp . getUi (); // Or DocumentApp, SlidesApp or FormApp. ui . createMenu ( 'Custom Menu' ) . addItem ( 'First item' , 'menuItem1' ) . addSeparator () . addSubMenu ( ui . createMenu ( 'Sub-menu' ) . addItem ( 'Second item' , 'menuItem2' )) . addToUi (); } function menuItem1 () { SpreadsheetApp . getUi () // Or DocumentApp, SlidesApp or FormApp. . alert ( 'You clicked the first menu item!' ); } function menuItem2 () { SpreadsheetApp . getUi () // Or DocumentApp, SlidesApp or FormApp. . alert ( 'You clicked the second menu item!' ); } A document, spreadsheet, presentation, or form can only contain one menu with a given name.
- Custom menus in Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms Apps Script can add new menus in Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms, with each menu item tied to a function in a script. (In Forms, custom menus are visible only to an editor who opens the form to modify it, not to a user who opens the form to respond.) Only bound scripts can create menus.
- Delete any code in the script editor and paste in the code below. function showMessageBox () { SpreadsheetApp . getUi (). alert ( 'You clicked it!' ); } Return to Sheets and insert an image or drawing by selecting Insert > Image or Insert > Drawing .
- Menus cannot be removed while the file is open, although you can write your onOpen function to skip the menu in the future if a certain property is set.
