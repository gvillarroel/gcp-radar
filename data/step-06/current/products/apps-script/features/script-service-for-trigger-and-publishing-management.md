### Installable Triggers \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 204
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- To create this trigger from a standalone script, replace SpreadsheetApp.getActive() with a call to SpreadsheetApp.openById(id) . triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / Creates a trigger for when a spreadsheet opens. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable / function createSpreadsheetOpenTrigger () { const ss = SpreadsheetApp . getActive (); ScriptApp . newTrigger ( "myFunction" ). forSpreadsheet ( ss ). onOpen (). create (); } To programmatically modify an existing installable trigger, you must delete it and create a new one.
- Time-driven triggers let scripts execute at a particular time or on a recurring interval, as frequently as every minute or as infrequently as once per month. (An add-on can use a time-driven trigger once per hour at most.) The time might be slightly randomized—for example, if you create a recurring 9 AM trigger, Apps Script chooses a time between 9 AM and 10 AM, then keeps that timing consistent from day to day so that 24 hours elapse before the trigger fires again.
- For both simple and installable triggers, Apps Script passes the triggered function an event object that contains information about the context in which the event occurred.
- If you have previously stored the ID of a trigger, delete it by passing the ID as an argument to the following function. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / Deletes a trigger. @param {string} triggerId The Trigger ID. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable / function deleteTrigger ( triggerId ) { // Loop over all triggers. const allTriggers = ScriptApp . getProjectTriggers (); for ( let index = 0 ; index < allTriggers . length ; index ++ ) { // If the current trigger is the correct one, delete it. if ( allTriggers [ index ]. getUniqueId () === triggerId ) { ScriptApp . deleteTrigger ( allTriggers [ index ]); break ; } } } Before creating a trigger, verify that the associated function has all the necessary OAuth permissions .

Evidence snippets:
- For example, the onEdit(e) function below sets a comment on the cell that records the last time it was edited. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when editing the spreadsheet. @param {Event} e The onEdit event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#onedite / function onEdit ( e ) { // Set a comment on the edited cell to indicate when it was changed. const range = e . range ; range . setNote ( Last modified: ${ new Date () } ); } The onEdit() trigger only queues up to 2 trigger events. onSelectionChange(e) The onSelectionChange(e) trigger runs automatically when a user changes the selection in a spreadsheet.
- These restrictions don't apply to doGet(e) or doPost(e) . onOpen(e) The onOpen(e) trigger runs automatically when a user opens a spreadsheet, document, presentation, or form that they have permission to edit. (The trigger does not run when responding to a form, only when opening the form to edit it.) onOpen(e) is most commonly used to add custom menu items to Google Sheets, Slides, Docs, or Forms. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when opening the spreadsheet. @param {Event} e The onOpen event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#onopene / function onOpen ( e ) { // Add a custom menu to the spreadsheet.
- In the following example, if an empty cell is selected, the onSelectionChange(e) function sets the cell's background to red. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when the selection changes in the spreadsheet. @param {Event} e The onSelectionChange event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#onselectionchangee / function onSelectionChange ( e ) { // Set background to red if a single empty cell is selected. const range = e . range ; if ( range . getNumRows () === 1 && range . getNumColumns () === 1 && range . getCell ( 1 , 1 ). getValue () === "" ) { range . setBackground ( "red" ); } } doGet(e) and doPost(e) The doGet(e) trigger runs automatically when a user visits a web app or a program sends an HTTP GET request to a web app. doPost(e) runs when a program sends an HTTP POST request to a web app.
- Learn more about authorization . triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when installing the add-on. @param {Event} e The onInstall event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#oninstalle / function onInstall ( e ) { onOpen ( e ); } onEdit(e) The onEdit(e) trigger runs automatically when a user changes the value of any cell in a spreadsheet.
