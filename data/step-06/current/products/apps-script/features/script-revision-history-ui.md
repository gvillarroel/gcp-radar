Evidence snippets:
- To create this trigger from a standalone script, replace SpreadsheetApp.getActive() with a call to SpreadsheetApp.openById(id) . triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / Creates a trigger for when a spreadsheet opens. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable / function createSpreadsheetOpenTrigger () { const ss = SpreadsheetApp . getActive (); ScriptApp . newTrigger ( "myFunction" ). forSpreadsheet ( ss ). onOpen (). create (); } To programmatically modify an existing installable trigger, you must delete it and create a new one.
- For example, a standalone script can programmatically create an installable trigger for an arbitrary Google Sheets file by calling TriggerBuilder.forSpreadsheet(key) and passing in the spreadsheet's ID.
- For standalone scripts, users need at least view access to the script file for triggers to run properly.
- If you have previously stored the ID of a trigger, delete it by passing the ID as an argument to the following function. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / Deletes a trigger. @param {string} triggerId The Trigger ID. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable / function deleteTrigger ( triggerId ) { // Loop over all triggers. const allTriggers = ScriptApp . getProjectTriggers (); for ( let index = 0 ; index < allTriggers . length ; index ++ ) { // If the current trigger is the correct one, delete it. if ( allTriggers [ index ]. getUniqueId () === triggerId ) { ScriptApp . deleteTrigger ( allTriggers [ index ]); break ; } } } Before creating a trigger, verify that the associated function has all the necessary OAuth permissions .
