### Advanced Google services \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/advanced](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/advanced)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 92
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Events . insert ( event , 'primary' , optionalArgs ); UrlFetch (HTTP): const event = { summary : 'Lunch' , location : 'Deli' , start : { dateTime : '2026-01-01T12:00:00-05:00' }, end : { dateTime : '2026-01-01T13:00:00-05:00' } }; const url = 'https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?sendUpdates=all' ; const options = { method : 'post' , contentType : 'application/json' , headers : { Authorization : Bearer ${ ScriptApp . getOAuthToken () } }, payload : JSON . stringify ( event ) }; UrlFetchApp . fetch ( url , options ); For the UrlFetchApp method, manually specify the required OAuth scopes in the script's manifest file .
- The following table compares the two methods: Feature Advanced Service UrlFetch (HTTP) Authorization Handled automatically Manual handling required Autocomplete Available Not available Functionality Scope May be a subset of the API Full access to all API features Complexity Easier More complex (requires constructing headers and parsing responses) Code comparison The code samples show the difference in complexity between creating a Calendar event using the advanced service versus using UrlFetchApp .
- To enable the API manually: Open the Cloud project associated with your script in the Google Cloud console At the top of the console, click into the search bar and type part of the name of the API (for example, "Calendar"), then click the name once you see it.
- How method signatures are determined Advanced services generally use the same objects, method names, and parameters as the corresponding public APIs, although method signatures are translated for use in Apps Script.
