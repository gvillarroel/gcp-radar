Evidence snippets:
- The Spreadsheet API adds a new NamedRange type and the following related methods: NamedRange.getName() gets the name of the named range NamedRange.setName(name) sets the name of the named range NamedRange.getRange() gets the underlying range associated with the named range NamedRange.setRange(range) sets the underlying range associated with the named range NamedRange.remove() deletes the named range Spreadsheet.getNamedRanges() gets an array of all the named ranges in the spreadsheet Sheet.getNamedRanges() gets an array of all the named ranges in the sheet Protection.setNamedRange(range) associates an existing protected range with an existing named range The Utilities API includes a new getUuid() method that generates a unique identifier.
- PageProtection Spreadsheet.getSheetProtection() Spreadsheet.setSheetProtection(permissions) Sheet.getSheetProtection() Sheet.setSheetProtection(permissions) Replaced the method SpreadsheetApp.open(file) , which takes a File object from the deprecated DocsList service as a parameter, with a version that takes a File object from the Drive service instead.
- Fixed an issue with UiApp panels that launch from a Google Spreadsheet, where the X to close was not displaying if the title of the application was not set.

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 106
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- This means that anyone with permission to edit the spreadsheet can also edit any Apps Script code attached to it.
- Capitalization doesn't matter, although the names of spreadsheet functions are traditionally uppercase.
- If each cell required its own function call, the operation would take considerably more time, since the Apps Script server would have to download and parse the XML feed each time. / Show the title and date for the first page of posts on the Developer blog. @return Two columns of data representing posts on the Developer blog. @customfunction / function getBlogPosts () { var array = []; var url = 'https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/atom.xml' ; var xml = UrlFetchApp . fetch ( url ). getContentText (); var document = XmlService . parse ( xml ); var root = document . getRootElement (); var atom = XmlService . getNamespace ( 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' ); var entries = document . getRootElement (). getChildren ( 'entry' , atom ); for ( var i = 0 ; i < entries . length ; i ++ ) { var title = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'title' , atom ). getText (); var date = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'published' , atom ). getValue (); array . push ([ title , date ]); } return array ; } These techniques can be applied to nearly any custom function that is used repeatedly throughout a spreadsheet, although the implementation details vary depending on the function's behavior.
- Consequently, they can only call services that don't have access to personal data, specifically the following: Supported services Notes Cache Works, but not particularly useful in custom functions HTML Can generate HTML, but can't display it (rarely useful) JDBC Language Lock Works, but not particularly useful in custom functions Maps Can calculate directions, but not display maps Properties getUserProperties() only gets the properties of the spreadsheet owner.
