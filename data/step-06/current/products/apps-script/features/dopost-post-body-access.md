Evidence snippets:
- May 09, 2013 Feature Issue 2158 : The request object passed in to doPost() methods now contains the POST body.
- It can be accessed using e.postData.getDataAsString().
- The following methods have been added to the Group , Image , Line , PageElement , Shape , SheetsChart , Table , Video , and WordArt classes: bringForward() bringToFront() sendBackward() sendToBack() setDescription(description) setTitle(title) The Spreadsheet service has been extended with the following new classes and methods that let you add and search for metadata strings attached to rows, columns, sheets, or spreadsheets: DeveloperMetadata DeveloperMetadataFinder DeveloperMetadataLocation DeveloperMetadataLocationType DeveloperMetadataVisibility Range.addDeveloperMetadata(key) Range.addDeveloperMetadata(key, visibility) Range.addDeveloperMetadata(key, value) Range.addDeveloperMetadata(key, value, visibility) Range.createDeveloperMetadataFinder() Range.getDeveloperMetadata() Sheet.addDeveloperMetadata(key) Sheet.addDeveloperMetadata(key, visibility) Sheet.addDeveloperMetadata(key, value) Sheet.addDeveloperMetadata(key, value, visibility) Sheet.createDeveloperMetadataFinder() Sheet.getDeveloperMetadata() Spreadsheet.addDeveloperMetadata(key) Spreadsheet.addDeveloperMetadata(key, visibility) Spreadsheet.addDeveloperMetadata(key, value) Spreadsheet.addDeveloperMetadata(key, value, visibility) Spreadsheet.createDeveloperMetadataFinder() Spreadsheet.getDeveloperMetadata() October 30, 2018 Feature The Spreadsheet service has been extended with the following new classes and methods: OverGridImage Sheet.getImages() Sheet.isColumnHiddenByUser(columnPosition) Sheet.isRowHiddenByFilter(rowPosition) Sheet.isRowHiddenByUser(rowPosition) Spreadsheet.getImages() Spreadsheet.isColumnHiddenByUser(columnPosition) Spreadsheet.isRowHiddenByFilter(rowPosition) Spreadsheet.isRowHiddenByUser(rowPosition) The following methods have been added to existing services: console service console.error() console.info() console.warn() DataStudio service Field.isHidden() Field.setIsHidden() Gmail service GmailAttachment.getHash() GmailMessage.getAttachments(options) Change The following methods in the Spreadsheet service now return an OverGridImage object instead of void: Sheet.insertImage(blobSource, column, row) Sheet.insertImage(blobSource, column, row, offsetX, offsetY) Sheet.insertImage(url, column, row) Sheet.insertImage(url, column, row, offsetX, offsetY) October 18, 2018 Feature The Card service has been extended with the following classes and methods to support Gmail add-on compose actions : CardService.UpdateDraftActionResponse CardService.UpdateDraftActionResponseBuilder CardService.UpdateDraftBodyAction CardService.ContentType CardService.UpdateDraftBodyType CardService.newUpdateDraftActionResponseBuilder() CardService.newUpdateDraftBodyAction() September 27, 2018 Announcement The Data Studio service is now available.
- August 31, 2021 Feature The Drive Service has added three new methods to the file and folder classes to manage the use of resource keys when sharing files and folders. getSecurityUpdateEligible() : Gets whether a file for folder is eligible to apply the security update that requires a resource key for access when it's shared using a link. getSecurityUpdateEnabled() : Gets whether a file or folder requires a resource key for access when it's shared using a link. setSecurityUpdateEnabled(enabled) : Sets whether the file or folder requires a resource key for access when it's shared using a link.

Evidence snippets:
- If each cell required its own function call, the operation would take considerably more time, since the Apps Script server would have to download and parse the XML feed each time. / Show the title and date for the first page of posts on the Developer blog. @return Two columns of data representing posts on the Developer blog. @customfunction / function getBlogPosts () { var array = []; var url = 'https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/atom.xml' ; var xml = UrlFetchApp . fetch ( url ). getContentText (); var document = XmlService . parse ( xml ); var root = document . getRootElement (); var atom = XmlService . getNamespace ( 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' ); var entries = document . getRootElement (). getChildren ( 'entry' , atom ); for ( var i = 0 ; i < entries . length ; i ++ ) { var title = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'title' , atom ). getText (); var date = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'published' , atom ). getValue (); array . push ([ title , date ]); } return array ; } These techniques can be applied to nearly any custom function that is used repeatedly throughout a spreadsheet, although the implementation details vary depending on the function's behavior.
- Consequently, they can only call services that don't have access to personal data, specifically the following: Supported services Notes Cache Works, but not particularly useful in custom functions HTML Can generate HTML, but can't display it (rarely useful) JDBC Language Lock Works, but not particularly useful in custom functions Maps Can calculate directions, but not display maps Properties getUserProperties() only gets the properties of the spreadsheet owner.
- Anyone who has access to the spreadsheet can copy the script. (Collaborators who have only view access can't open the script editor in the original spreadsheet.
- To create a custom function, write JavaScript code in the script editor accessed through the Extensions menu in Google Sheets.

Evidence snippets:
- In the following example, if an empty cell is selected, the onSelectionChange(e) function sets the cell's background to red. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when the selection changes in the spreadsheet. @param {Event} e The onSelectionChange event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#onselectionchangee / function onSelectionChange ( e ) { // Set background to red if a single empty cell is selected. const range = e . range ; if ( range . getNumRows () === 1 && range . getNumColumns () === 1 && range . getCell ( 1 , 1 ). getValue () === "" ) { range . setBackground ( "red" ); } } doGet(e) and doPost(e) The doGet(e) trigger runs automatically when a user visits a web app or a program sends an HTTP GET request to a web app. doPost(e) runs when a program sends an HTTP POST request to a web app.
- These restrictions don't apply to doGet(e) or doPost(e) . onOpen(e) The onOpen(e) trigger runs automatically when a user opens a spreadsheet, document, presentation, or form that they have permission to edit. (The trigger does not run when responding to a form, only when opening the form to edit it.) onOpen(e) is most commonly used to add custom menu items to Google Sheets, Slides, Docs, or Forms. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when opening the spreadsheet. @param {Event} e The onOpen event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#onopene / function onOpen ( e ) { // Add a custom menu to the spreadsheet.
- Getting started To use a simple trigger, create a function that uses one of these reserved function names: onOpen(e) runs when a user opens a spreadsheet, document, presentation, or form that the user has permission to edit. onInstall(e) runs when a user installs an Editor add-on from within Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms. onEdit(e) runs when a user changes a value in a spreadsheet. onSelectionChange(e) runs when a user changes the selection in a spreadsheet. doGet(e) runs when a user visits a web app or a program sends an HTTP GET request to a web app. doPost(e) runs when a program sends an HTTP POST request to a web app.
- Event Simple triggers Installable triggers Open Sheets Slides Forms Docs function onOpen(e) Sheets Forms Docs Edit Sheets function onEdit(e) Sheets Selection change Sheets function onSelectionChange(e) Install Sheets Slides Forms Docs function onInstall(e) Change Sheets Form submit Sheets Forms Time-driven (clock) Sheets Slides Forms Docs Standalone Get Standalone function doGet(e) Post Standalone function doPost(e) The open event for Google Forms does not occur when a user opens a form to respond, but rather when an editor opens the form to modify it.
