Evidence snippets:
- December 18, 2019 Feature The Spreadsheet service has been extended with the following class and new methods to support using color building and theme colors: Color ColorBuilder SpreadsheetTheme ThemeColor ThemeColorType SpreadsheetApp.newColor() Spreadsheet.getPredefinedSpreadsheetThemes() Spreadsheet.getSpreadsheetTheme() Spreadsheet.resetSpreadsheetTheme() Spreadsheet.setSpreadsheetTheme(theme) December 11, 2019 Feature The Data Studio service has been extended with the following class and new methods to support different response types and dynamic statuses: GetDataResponse GetSchemaResponse SetCredentialsResponse Checkbox.setIsDynamic(isDynamic) CommunityConnector.newGetDataResponse() CommunityConnector.newGetSchemaResponse() CommunityConnector.newSetCredentialsResponse() Config.setIsSteppedConfig(isSteppedConfig) SelectMultiple.setIsDynamic(isDynamic) SelectSingle.setIsDynamic(isDynamic) TextArea.setIsDynamic(isDynamic) TextInput.setIsDynamic(isDynamic) November 06, 2019 Feature The Spreadsheet service has been extended with the following class and new methods to support using slicers to filter ranges, charts, and pivot tables: Slicer Sheet.getSlicers() Sheet.insertSlicer(range, anchorRowPos, anchorColPos) Sheet.insertSlicer(range, anchorRowPos, anchorColPos, offsetX, offsetY) The Script service has been extended with the ScriptApp.getIdentityToken() method , which returns an identity token for the effective user.
- Added several new ScriptApp methods, classes, and enums to support installable triggers in add-ons: AuthorizationInfo : An object used to determine whether the user needs to authorize this script to use one or more services, and to provide the URL for an authorization dialog.
- Added the FormTriggerBuilder class to allow scripts to respond to Forms events.
- The new classes and methods include: BandingTheme Banding BooleanCondition BooleanCriteria ConditionalFormatRuleBuilder ConditionalFormatRule Dimension Direction FilterCriteriaBuilder FilterCriteria Filter GradientCondition InterpolationType PivotFilter PivotGroup PivotTableSummarizeFunction PivotTable PivotTableDisplayType PivotValue RangeList RelativeDate Selection TextDirection TextRotation TextToColumnsDelimiter WrapStrategy EmbeddedChartBuilder.setHiddenDimensionStrategy(strategy) (also in each of the type-specific chart builder classes) EmbeddedChartBuilder.setNumHeaders(headers) (also in each of the type-specific chart builder classes) EmbeddedChartBuilder.setMergeStrategy(mergeStrategy) (also in each of the type-specific chart builder classes) EmbeddedChartBuilder.setTransposeRowsAndColumns(transpose) (also in each of the type-specific chart builder classes) Range.activateAsCurrentCell() Range.applyColumnBanding() Range.applyColumnBanding(bandingTheme) Range.applyColumnBanding(bandingTheme, showHeader, showFooter) Range.applyRowBanding() Range.applyRowBanding(bandingTheme) Range.applyRowBanding(bandingTheme, showHeader, showFooter) Range.createFilter() Range.createPivotTable(sourceData) Range.deleteCells(shiftDimension) Range.getBandings() Range.getNextDataCell(direction) Range.getTextDirection() Range.getTextDirections() Range.getTextRotation() Range.getTextRotations() Range.getWrapStrategies() Range.getWrapStrategy() Range.insertCells(shiftDimension) Range.setShowHyperlink(showHyperlink) Range.setTextDirection(direction) Range.setTextDirections(directions) Range.setTextRotation(degrees) Range.setTextRotation(rotation) Range.setTextRotations(rotations) Range.setVerticalText(isVertical) Range.setWrapStrategies(strategies) Range.setWrapStrategy(strategy) Range.setTextToColumns() Range.setTextToColumns(delimiter) Range.setTextToColumns(delimiter) Sheet.autoResizeColumns(startColumns, numColumns) Sheet.autoResizeRows(startRows, numRows) Sheet.clearConditionalFormatRules() Sheet.getActiveRangeList() Sheet.getBandings() Sheet.getConditionalFormatRules() Sheet.getCurrentCell() Sheet.getFilter() Sheet.getPivotTables() Sheet.getRangeList(a1Notations) Sheet.getSelection() Sheet.hasHiddenGridlines() Sheet.isRightToLeft() Sheet.setActiveRangeList(rangeList) Sheet.setColumnWidths(startColumn numColumns, width) Sheet.setConditionalFormatRules(rules) Sheet.setCurrentCell(cell) Sheet.setHiddenGridlines(hideGridlines) Sheet.setRightToLeft(rightToLeft) Sheet.setRowHeights(startRow, numRows, height) Spreadsheet.getActiveRangeList() Spreadsheet.getBandings() Spreadsheet.getCurrentCell() Spreadsheet.getRangeList(a1Notations) Spreadsheet.getSelection() Spreadsheet.setActiveRangeList(rangeList) Spreadsheet.setCurrentCell(cell) Feature The Charts service has been extended to support EmbeddedCharts in Google Sheets with the enums ChartHiddenDimensionStrategy and ChartMergeStrategy .

### Installable Triggers \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 106
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If you have previously stored the ID of a trigger, delete it by passing the ID as an argument to the following function. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / Deletes a trigger. @param {string} triggerId The Trigger ID. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable / function deleteTrigger ( triggerId ) { // Loop over all triggers. const allTriggers = ScriptApp . getProjectTriggers (); for ( let index = 0 ; index < allTriggers . length ; index ++ ) { // If the current trigger is the correct one, delete it. if ( allTriggers [ index ]. getUniqueId () === triggerId ) { ScriptApp . deleteTrigger ( allTriggers [ index ]); break ; } } } Before creating a trigger, verify that the associated function has all the necessary OAuth permissions .
- Time-driven triggers let scripts execute at a particular time or on a recurring interval, as frequently as every minute or as infrequently as once per month. (An add-on can use a time-driven trigger once per hour at most.) The time might be slightly randomized—for example, if you create a recurring 9 AM trigger, Apps Script chooses a time between 9 AM and 10 AM, then keeps that timing consistent from day to day so that 24 hours elapse before the trigger fires again.
- There are several installable triggers for Google Workspace applications: An installable open trigger runs when a user opens a spreadsheet, document, or form that they have permission to edit.
- For both simple and installable triggers, Apps Script passes the triggered function an event object that contains information about the context in which the event occurred.

### Simple Triggers \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 106
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, the onEdit(e) function below sets a comment on the cell that records the last time it was edited. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when editing the spreadsheet. @param {Event} e The onEdit event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#onedite / function onEdit ( e ) { // Set a comment on the edited cell to indicate when it was changed. const range = e . range ; range . setNote ( Last modified: ${ new Date () } ); } The onEdit() trigger only queues up to 2 trigger events. onSelectionChange(e) The onSelectionChange(e) trigger runs automatically when a user changes the selection in a spreadsheet.
- These restrictions don't apply to doGet(e) or doPost(e) . onOpen(e) The onOpen(e) trigger runs automatically when a user opens a spreadsheet, document, presentation, or form that they have permission to edit. (The trigger does not run when responding to a form, only when opening the form to edit it.) onOpen(e) is most commonly used to add custom menu items to Google Sheets, Slides, Docs, or Forms. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when opening the spreadsheet. @param {Event} e The onOpen event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#onopene / function onOpen ( e ) { // Add a custom menu to the spreadsheet.
- Event Simple triggers Installable triggers Open Sheets Slides Forms Docs function onOpen(e) Sheets Forms Docs Edit Sheets function onEdit(e) Sheets Selection change Sheets function onSelectionChange(e) Install Sheets Slides Forms Docs function onInstall(e) Change Sheets Form submit Sheets Forms Time-driven (clock) Sheets Slides Forms Docs Standalone Get Standalone function doGet(e) Post Standalone function doPost(e) The open event for Google Forms does not occur when a user opens a form to respond, but rather when an editor opens the form to modify it.
- Restrictions Because simple triggers fire automatically, without asking the user for authorization, they are subject to several restrictions: The script must be bound to a Google Sheets, Slides, Docs, or Forms file, or else be an add-on that extends one of those applications.
