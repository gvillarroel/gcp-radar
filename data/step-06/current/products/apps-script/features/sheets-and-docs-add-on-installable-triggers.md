### Installable Triggers \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`

- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- To create this trigger from a standalone script, replace SpreadsheetApp.getActive() with a call to SpreadsheetApp.openById(id) . triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / Creates a trigger for when a spreadsheet opens. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable / function createSpreadsheetOpenTrigger () { const ss = SpreadsheetApp . getActive (); ScriptApp . newTrigger ( "myFunction" ). forSpreadsheet ( ss ). onOpen (). create (); } To programmatically modify an existing installable trigger, you must delete it and create a new one.
- Time-driven triggers let scripts execute at a particular time or on a recurring interval, as frequently as every minute or as infrequently as once per month. (An add-on can use a time-driven trigger once per hour at most.) The time might be slightly randomized—for example, if you create a recurring 9 AM trigger, Apps Script chooses a time between 9 AM and 10 AM, then keeps that timing consistent from day to day so that 24 hours elapse before the trigger fires again.
- Installable triggers, however, offer more flexibility than simple triggers: they can call services that require authorization , they offer several additional types of events including time-driven (clock) triggers, and they can be controlled programmatically.
- Installable triggers are subject to restrictions, including not running in read-only mode, not being triggered by script executions or API requests (with one exception), and always running under the creator's account.

Evidence snippets:
- These restrictions don't apply to doGet(e) or doPost(e) . onOpen(e) The onOpen(e) trigger runs automatically when a user opens a spreadsheet, document, presentation, or form that they have permission to edit. (The trigger does not run when responding to a form, only when opening the form to edit it.) onOpen(e) is most commonly used to add custom menu items to Google Sheets, Slides, Docs, or Forms. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when opening the spreadsheet. @param {Event} e The onOpen event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#onopene / function onOpen ( e ) { // Add a custom menu to the spreadsheet.

- Restrictions Because simple triggers fire automatically, without asking the user for authorization, they are subject to several restrictions: The script must be bound to a Google Sheets, Slides, Docs, or Forms file, or else be an add-on that extends one of those applications.
- For example, Google Sheets, Slides, Forms, and Docs all support simple open triggers, but only Sheets, Docs and Forms support installable open triggers.
