### Custom Functions in Google Sheets \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 68
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If each cell required its own function call, the operation would take considerably more time, since the Apps Script server would have to download and parse the XML feed each time. / Show the title and date for the first page of posts on the Developer blog. @return Two columns of data representing posts on the Developer blog. @customfunction / function getBlogPosts () { var array = []; var url = 'https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/atom.xml' ; var xml = UrlFetchApp . fetch ( url ). getContentText (); var document = XmlService . parse ( xml ); var root = document . getRootElement (); var atom = XmlService . getNamespace ( 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' ); var entries = document . getRootElement (). getChildren ( 'entry' , atom ); for ( var i = 0 ; i < entries . length ; i ++ ) { var title = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'title' , atom ). getText (); var date = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'published' , atom ). getValue (); array . push ([ title , date ]); } return array ; } These techniques can be applied to nearly any custom function that is used repeatedly throughout a spreadsheet, although the implementation details vary depending on the function's behavior.
- For example, the DOUBLE() function shown earlier can be rewritten to accept a single cell or range of cells as follows: / Multiplies the input value by 2. @param {number Array<Array<number>>} input The value or range of cells to multiply. @return The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return Array . isArray ( input ) ? input . map ( row = > row . map ( cell = > cell 2 )) : input 2 ; } This approach uses the map method of JavaScript's Array object on the two-dimensional array of cells to get each row, then for each row, it uses map again to return double each cell's value.
- This means that a custom function written in one spreadsheet can't be used in other spreadsheets unless you use one of the following methods: Click Extensions > Apps Script to open the script editor, then copy the script text from the original spreadsheet and paste it into the script editor of another spreadsheet.
- Utilities XML If your custom function throws the error message You do not have permission to call X service. , the service requires user authorization and thus can't be used in a custom function.
