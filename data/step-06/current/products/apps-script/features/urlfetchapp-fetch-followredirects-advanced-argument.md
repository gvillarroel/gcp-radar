### Advanced Google services \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/advanced](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/advanced)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 134
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The following table compares the two methods: Feature Advanced Service UrlFetch (HTTP) Authorization Handled automatically Manual handling required Autocomplete Available Not available Functionality Scope May be a subset of the API Full access to all API features Complexity Easier More complex (requires constructing headers and parsing responses) Code comparison The code samples show the difference in complexity between creating a Calendar event using the advanced service versus using UrlFetchApp .
- Events . insert ( event , 'primary' , optionalArgs ); UrlFetch (HTTP): const event = { summary : 'Lunch' , location : 'Deli' , start : { dateTime : '2026-01-01T12:00:00-05:00' }, end : { dateTime : '2026-01-01T13:00:00-05:00' } }; const url = 'https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?sendUpdates=all' ; const options = { method : 'post' , contentType : 'application/json' , headers : { Authorization : Bearer ${ ScriptApp . getOAuthToken () } }, payload : JSON . stringify ( event ) }; UrlFetchApp . fetch ( url , options ); For the UrlFetchApp method, manually specify the required OAuth scopes in the script's manifest file .
- For example, to enable the Google Drive advanced service, add the enabledAdvancedServices field to the dependencies object: { "timeZone" : "America/Denver" , "dependencies" : { "enabledAdvancedServices" : [ { "userSymbol" : "Drive" , "version" : "v3" , "serviceId" : "drive" } ] }, "exceptionLogging" : "STACKDRIVER" , "runtimeVersion" : "V8" } After you enable an advanced service, it's available in autocomplete.
- If an advanced service is configured to accept HTTP request headers, and you set a request headers JavaScript object, then you must also set the optional parameters JavaScript object (to an empty object if you aren't using optional parameters).

### Custom Functions in Google Sheets \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If each cell required its own function call, the operation would take considerably more time, since the Apps Script server would have to download and parse the XML feed each time. / Show the title and date for the first page of posts on the Developer blog. @return Two columns of data representing posts on the Developer blog. @customfunction / function getBlogPosts () { var array = []; var url = 'https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/atom.xml' ; var xml = UrlFetchApp . fetch ( url ). getContentText (); var document = XmlService . parse ( xml ); var root = document . getRootElement (); var atom = XmlService . getNamespace ( 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' ); var entries = document . getRootElement (). getChildren ( 'entry' , atom ); for ( var i = 0 ; i < entries . length ; i ++ ) { var title = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'title' , atom ). getText (); var date = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'published' , atom ). getValue (); array . push ([ title , date ]); } return array ; } These techniques can be applied to nearly any custom function that is used repeatedly throughout a spreadsheet, although the implementation details vary depending on the function's behavior.
- Note: While Apps Script supports standard JSDoc for autocomplete in the editor, the Google Sheets UI has specific limitations regarding which tags and syntax are displayed in the spreadsheet's formula helper. / Multiplies the input value by 2. @param {number} input The value to multiply. @return {number} The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return input 2 ; } Advanced This section covers advanced custom function topics.
- Arguments Like a built-in function, a custom function can take arguments as input values: If you call your function with a reference to a single cell as an argument (like =DOUBLE(A1) ), the argument is the value of the cell.
- Similarly, the following custom function efficiently fetches live content from the Internet and uses a two-dimensional array to display two columns of results with just a single function call.
