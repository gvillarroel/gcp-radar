### Custom Functions in Google Sheets \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 82
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, the DOUBLE() function shown earlier can be rewritten to accept a single cell or range of cells as follows: / Multiplies the input value by 2. @param {number Array<Array<number>>} input The value or range of cells to multiply. @return The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return Array . isArray ( input ) ? input . map ( row = > row . map ( cell = > cell 2 )) : input 2 ; } This approach uses the map method of JavaScript's Array object on the two-dimensional array of cells to get each row, then for each row, it uses map again to return double each cell's value.
- This means that a custom function written in one spreadsheet can't be used in other spreadsheets unless you use one of the following methods: Click Extensions > Apps Script to open the script editor, then copy the script text from the original spreadsheet and paste it into the script editor of another spreadsheet.
- Utilities XML If your custom function throws the error message You do not have permission to call X service. , the service requires user authorization and thus can't be used in a custom function.
- If you use the getValue method in custom functions, be aware that the referenced range isn't directly passed as an argument to the custom function.
