- The Spreadsheet API adds a new NamedRange type and the following related methods: NamedRange.getName() gets the name of the named range NamedRange.setName(name) sets the name of the named range NamedRange.getRange() gets the underlying range associated with the named range NamedRange.setRange(range) sets the underlying range associated with the named range NamedRange.remove() deletes the named range Spreadsheet.getNamedRanges() gets an array of all the named ranges in the spreadsheet Sheet.getNamedRanges() gets an array of all the named ranges in the sheet Protection.setNamedRange(range) associates an existing protected range with an existing named range The Utilities API includes a new getUuid() method that generates a unique identifier.
- Bookmark NamedRange RangeBuilder Document.addBookmark(position) Document.addNamedRange(name, range) Document.getBookmark(id) Document.getBookmarks() Document.getNamedRangeById(id) Document.getNamedRanges() Document.getNamedRanges(name) Document.newPosition(element, offset) Document.newRange() Document.setCursor(position) Document.setSelection(range) Position.insertBookmark() Added the following ScriptApp class and methods, which allow scripts to create state tokens that can be used in callback APIs (like OAuth flows), as well as to retrieve the script's own OAuth 2.0 access token.

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 76
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, the DOUBLE() function shown earlier can be rewritten to accept a single cell or range of cells as follows: / Multiplies the input value by 2. @param {number Array<Array<number>>} input The value or range of cells to multiply. @return The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return Array . isArray ( input ) ? input . map ( row = > row . map ( cell = > cell 2 )) : input 2 ; } This approach uses the map method of JavaScript's Array object on the two-dimensional array of cells to get each row, then for each row, it uses map again to return double each cell's value.
- Consequently, they can only call services that don't have access to personal data, specifically the following: Supported services Notes Cache Works, but not particularly useful in custom functions HTML Can generate HTML, but can't display it (rarely useful) JDBC Language Lock Works, but not particularly useful in custom functions Maps Can calculate directions, but not display maps Properties getUserProperties() only gets the properties of the spreadsheet owner.
- This means that a custom function written in one spreadsheet can't be used in other spreadsheets unless you use one of the following methods: Click Extensions > Apps Script to open the script editor, then copy the script text from the original spreadsheet and paste it into the script editor of another spreadsheet.
- Consequently, if you plan to use a custom function multiple times on a large range of data, consider modifying the function so that it accepts a range as input in the form of a two-dimensional array, then returns a two-dimensional array that can overflow into the appropriate cells.
