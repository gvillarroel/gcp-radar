Evidence snippets:
- CalendarList . list ({ maxResults : 100 , pageToken : pageToken , }); if ( ! calendars . items calendars . items . length === 0 ) { console . log ( "No calendars found." ); return ; } // Print the calendar id and calendar summary for ( const calendar of calendars . items ) { console . log ( "%s (ID: %s)" , calendar . summary , calendar . id ); } pageToken = calendars . nextPageToken ; } while ( pageToken ); } Listing events The following example demonstrates how to list the next 10 upcoming events in the user's default calendar. advanced/calendar.gs View on GitHub / Lists the next 10 upcoming events in the user's default calendar. @see https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/v3/reference/events/list / function listNext10Events () { const calendarId = "primary" ; const now = new Date (); const events = Calendar .
- Events . list ( calendarId , { timeMin : now . toISOString (), singleEvents : true , orderBy : "startTime" , maxResults : 10 , }); if ( ! events . items events . items . length === 0 ) { console . log ( "No events found." ); return ; } for ( const event of events . items ) { if ( event . start . date ) { // All-day event. const start = new Date ( event . start . date ); console . log ( "%s (%s)" , event . summary , start . toLocaleDateString ()); continue ; } const start = new Date ( event . start . dateTime ); console . log ( "%s (%s)" , event . summary , start . toLocaleString ()); } } Conditionally modifying an event The following example shows how to conditionally update a Calendar event using the If-Match header.
- The conditional fetch is accomplished by setting the 'If-None-Match' header to the etag of the last known state of the event. / function conditionalFetch () { const calendarId = "primary" ; const start = getRelativeDate ( 1 , 12 ); const end = getRelativeDate ( 1 , 13 ); let event = { summary : "Lunch Meeting" , location : "The Deli" , description : "To discuss our plans for the presentation next week." , start : { dateTime : start . toISOString (), }, end : { dateTime : end . toISOString (), }, attendees : [ { email : "gduser1@workspacesample.dev" }, { email : "gduser2@workspacesample.dev" }, ], // Red background.
- Use Calendar.Colors.get() for the full list. colorId : 11 , }; try { // call method to insert/create new event in provided calandar event = Calendar .

Evidence snippets:
- When the Apps Script EventUpdated trigger fires indicating a calendar event change, perform an incremental sync for the affected calendar using the stored nextSyncToken .
- For each calendar, perform an initial sync operation using the Calendar advanced service's Events.list() method.
- Events produced by installable triggers include a triggerUid to identify the specific trigger.
- For example, the following sample code shows a simple onEdit(e) trigger for a Google Sheets script that uses the event object to determine which cell was edited. function onEdit ( e ){ // Set a comment on the edited cell to indicate when it was changed . var range = e . range ; range . setNote ( 'Last modified: ' + new Date ()); } This page describes the fields in the event object for different types of triggers.
