Evidence snippets:
- When the Apps Script EventUpdated trigger fires indicating a calendar event change, perform an incremental sync for the affected calendar using the stored nextSyncToken .
- When a trigger fires, an event object ( e ) containing contextual information is passed to the function as an argument.
- The event object contains information about the context that caused the trigger to fire.
- For example, the following sample code shows a simple onEdit(e) trigger for a Google Sheets script that uses the event object to determine which cell was edited. function onEdit ( e ){ // Set a comment on the edited cell to indicate when it was changed . var range = e . range ; range . setNote ( 'Last modified: ' + new Date ()); } This page describes the fields in the event object for different types of triggers.

Evidence snippets:
- These restrictions don't apply to doGet(e) or doPost(e) . onOpen(e) The onOpen(e) trigger runs automatically when a user opens a spreadsheet, document, presentation, or form that they have permission to edit. (The trigger does not run when responding to a form, only when opening the form to edit it.) onOpen(e) is most commonly used to add custom menu items to Google Sheets, Slides, Docs, or Forms. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when opening the spreadsheet. @param {Event} e The onOpen event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#onopene / function onOpen ( e ) { // Add a custom menu to the spreadsheet.

- Both simple and installable triggers pass an event object containing context information to the triggered function.
- Most onEdit(e) triggers use the information in the event object to respond appropriately.
