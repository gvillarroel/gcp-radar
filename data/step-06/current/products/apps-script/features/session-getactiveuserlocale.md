- August 04, 2015 Feature Added the following methods to the Spreadsheet service to let scripts control "warning-based" protection for spreadsheet ranges (which means that every user can edit data in the area, except editing prompts the user to confirm the edit): Protection.isWarningOnly() Protection.setWarningOnly(warningOnly) June 30, 2015 Feature Added two variations of the method computeRsaSha256Signature to the Utilities global object to let scripts sign a string using the RSA SHA-256 algorithm.

### Custom Functions in Google Sheets \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 110
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- That is, built-in spreadsheet functions that return a different result each time they calculate — such as NOW() or RAND() — are not allowed as arguments to a custom function.
- If each cell required its own function call, the operation would take considerably more time, since the Apps Script server would have to download and parse the XML feed each time. / Show the title and date for the first page of posts on the Developer blog. @return Two columns of data representing posts on the Developer blog. @customfunction / function getBlogPosts () { var array = []; var url = 'https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/atom.xml' ; var xml = UrlFetchApp . fetch ( url ). getContentText (); var document = XmlService . parse ( xml ); var root = document . getRootElement (); var atom = XmlService . getNamespace ( 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' ); var entries = document . getRootElement (). getChildren ( 'entry' , atom ); for ( var i = 0 ; i < entries . length ; i ++ ) { var title = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'title' , atom ). getText (); var date = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'published' , atom ). getValue (); array . push ([ title , date ]); } return array ; } These techniques can be applied to nearly any custom function that is used repeatedly throughout a spreadsheet, although the implementation details vary depending on the function's behavior.
- Consequently, they can only call services that don't have access to personal data, specifically the following: Supported services Notes Cache Works, but not particularly useful in custom functions HTML Can generate HTML, but can't display it (rarely useful) JDBC Language Lock Works, but not particularly useful in custom functions Maps Can calculate directions, but not display maps Properties getUserProperties() only gets the properties of the spreadsheet owner.
- Note: While Apps Script supports standard JSDoc for autocomplete in the editor, the Google Sheets UI has specific limitations regarding which tags and syntax are displayed in the spreadsheet's formula helper. / Multiplies the input value by 2. @param {number} input The value to multiply. @return {number} The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return input 2 ; } Advanced This section covers advanced custom function topics.

### Custom Menus in Google Workspace \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/menus](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/menus)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 98
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For more information on the types of dialogs you can open, see the guide to dialogs and sidebars . function onOpen () { const ui = SpreadsheetApp . getUi (); // Or DocumentApp, SlidesApp or FormApp. ui . createMenu ( 'Custom Menu' ) . addItem ( 'First item' , 'menuItem1' ) . addSeparator () . addSubMenu ( ui . createMenu ( 'Sub-menu' ) . addItem ( 'Second item' , 'menuItem2' )) . addToUi (); } function menuItem1 () { SpreadsheetApp . getUi () // Or DocumentApp, SlidesApp or FormApp. . alert ( 'You clicked the first menu item!' ); } function menuItem2 () { SpreadsheetApp . getUi () // Or DocumentApp, SlidesApp or FormApp. . alert ( 'You clicked the second menu item!' ); } A document, spreadsheet, presentation, or form can only contain one menu with a given name.
- Custom menus in Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms Apps Script can add new menus in Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms, with each menu item tied to a function in a script. (In Forms, custom menus are visible only to an editor who opens the form to modify it, not to a user who opens the form to respond.) Only bound scripts can create menus.
- Delete any code in the script editor and paste in the code below. function showMessageBox () { SpreadsheetApp . getUi (). alert ( 'You clicked it!' ); } Return to Sheets and insert an image or drawing by selecting Insert > Image or Insert > Drawing .
- Clickable images and drawings in Sheets You can also assign an Apps Script function to an image or drawing in Sheets, provided the script is bound to the spreadsheet.
