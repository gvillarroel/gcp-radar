- Like all advanced services in Apps Script, the Admin SDK Groups Settings service uses the same objects, methods, and parameters as the public API.

### Custom Functions in Google Sheets \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 172
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If each cell required its own function call, the operation would take considerably more time, since the Apps Script server would have to download and parse the XML feed each time. / Show the title and date for the first page of posts on the Developer blog. @return Two columns of data representing posts on the Developer blog. @customfunction / function getBlogPosts () { var array = []; var url = 'https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/atom.xml' ; var xml = UrlFetchApp . fetch ( url ). getContentText (); var document = XmlService . parse ( xml ); var root = document . getRootElement (); var atom = XmlService . getNamespace ( 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' ); var entries = document . getRootElement (). getChildren ( 'entry' , atom ); for ( var i = 0 ; i < entries . length ; i ++ ) { var title = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'title' , atom ). getText (); var date = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'published' , atom ). getValue (); array . push ([ title , date ]); } return array ; } These techniques can be applied to nearly any custom function that is used repeatedly throughout a spreadsheet, although the implementation details vary depending on the function's behavior.
- Note: While Apps Script supports standard JSDoc for autocomplete in the editor, the Google Sheets UI has specific limitations regarding which tags and syntax are displayed in the spreadsheet's formula helper. / Multiplies the input value by 2. @param {number} input The value to multiply. @return {number} The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return input 2 ; } Advanced This section covers advanced custom function topics.
- This means that a custom function written in one spreadsheet can't be used in other spreadsheets unless you use one of the following methods: Click Extensions > Apps Script to open the script editor, then copy the script text from the original spreadsheet and paste it into the script editor of another spreadsheet.
- To use a service other than those in the preceding list, create a custom menu that runs an Apps Script function instead of writing a custom function.
