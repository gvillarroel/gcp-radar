### Custom Functions in Google Sheets \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 74
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If each cell required its own function call, the operation would take considerably more time, since the Apps Script server would have to download and parse the XML feed each time. / Show the title and date for the first page of posts on the Developer blog. @return Two columns of data representing posts on the Developer blog. @customfunction / function getBlogPosts () { var array = []; var url = 'https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/atom.xml' ; var xml = UrlFetchApp . fetch ( url ). getContentText (); var document = XmlService . parse ( xml ); var root = document . getRootElement (); var atom = XmlService . getNamespace ( 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' ); var entries = document . getRootElement (). getChildren ( 'entry' , atom ); for ( var i = 0 ; i < entries . length ; i ++ ) { var title = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'title' , atom ). getText (); var date = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'published' , atom ). getValue (); array . push ([ title , date ]); } return array ; } These techniques can be applied to nearly any custom function that is used repeatedly throughout a spreadsheet, although the implementation details vary depending on the function's behavior.
- For example, the DOUBLE() function shown earlier can be rewritten to accept a single cell or range of cells as follows: / Multiplies the input value by 2. @param {number Array<Array<number>>} input The value or range of cells to multiply. @return The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return Array . isArray ( input ) ? input . map ( row = > row . map ( cell = > cell 2 )) : input 2 ; } This approach uses the map method of JavaScript's Array object on the two-dimensional array of cells to get each row, then for each row, it uses map again to return double each cell's value.
- Note: While Apps Script supports standard JSDoc for autocomplete in the editor, the Google Sheets UI has specific limitations regarding which tags and syntax are displayed in the spreadsheet's formula helper. / Multiplies the input value by 2. @param {number} input The value to multiply. @return {number} The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return input 2 ; } Advanced This section covers advanced custom function topics.
- Here's a custom function, named DOUBLE , which multiplies an input value by 2: / Multiplies an input value by 2. @param {number} input The number to double. @return The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return input 2 ; } If you don't know how to write JavaScript and don't have time to learn, check the Google Workspace add-on store to see whether someone else has already built the custom function you need.
