- April 08, 2025 Feature You can now use the Forms Service to publish forms, and to have granular control over who can respond to forms.
- In Google Docs and Forms, sidebars now ignore the setWidth() method; they cannot be changed from the default width of 300px.
- Feature The Forms service now has the following method: Form.deleteResponse(responseId) The Utilities service now has the following methods: Utilities.computeDigest(algorithm, value) , where value is a Byte array Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(value, key) , where value and key are Byte arrays Utilities.computeHmacSignature(algorithm, value, key) , where value and key are Byte arrays Change The quota limits for UrlFetch GET response size and POST size have been increased to 50MB / call.
- Feature Added the following class, enum, and methods to the Spreadsheet service, to give precise control over protected sheets and ranges: Protection ProtectionType Range.canEdit() Range.isEndColumnBounded() Range.isEndRowBounded() Range.isStartColumnBounded() Range.isStartRowBounded() Range.protect() Sheet.getProtections(type) Sheet.protect() Spreadsheet.getProtections(type) Fixed Issue 4617 : HTML service pages that use the new IFRAME sandbox mode now render correctly in Firefox.

Evidence snippets:
- If each cell required its own function call, the operation would take considerably more time, since the Apps Script server would have to download and parse the XML feed each time. / Show the title and date for the first page of posts on the Developer blog. @return Two columns of data representing posts on the Developer blog. @customfunction / function getBlogPosts () { var array = []; var url = 'https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/atom.xml' ; var xml = UrlFetchApp . fetch ( url ). getContentText (); var document = XmlService . parse ( xml ); var root = document . getRootElement (); var atom = XmlService . getNamespace ( 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' ); var entries = document . getRootElement (). getChildren ( 'entry' , atom ); for ( var i = 0 ; i < entries . length ; i ++ ) { var title = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'title' , atom ). getText (); var date = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'published' , atom ). getValue (); array . push ([ title , date ]); } return array ; } These techniques can be applied to nearly any custom function that is used repeatedly throughout a spreadsheet, although the implementation details vary depending on the function's behavior.
- This means that a custom function written in one spreadsheet can't be used in other spreadsheets unless you use one of the following methods: Click Extensions > Apps Script to open the script editor, then copy the script text from the original spreadsheet and paste it into the script editor of another spreadsheet.
- However, when they make a copy, they become the owner of the copy and can see the script.) Publish the script as a Sheets Editor add-on .
- For example, the DOUBLE() function shown earlier can be rewritten to accept a single cell or range of cells as follows: / Multiplies the input value by 2. @param {number Array<Array<number>>} input The value or range of cells to multiply. @return The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return Array . isArray ( input ) ? input . map ( row = > row . map ( cell = > cell 2 )) : input 2 ; } This approach uses the map method of JavaScript's Array object on the two-dimensional array of cells to get each row, then for each row, it uses map again to return double each cell's value.

- Events . list ( calendarId , options ); } catch ( e ) { // Check to see if the sync token was invalidated by the server; // if so, perform a full sync instead. if ( e . message === "Sync token is no longer valid, a full sync is required." ) { properties . deleteProperty ( "syncToken" ); logSyncedEvents ( calendarId , true ); return ; } throw new Error ( e . message ); } if ( events . items && events . items . length === 0 ) { console . log ( "No events found." ); return ; } for ( const event of events . items ) { if ( event . status === "cancelled" ) { console . log ( "Event id %s was cancelled." , event . id ); return ; } if ( event . start . date ) { const start = new Date ( event . start . date ); console . log ( "%s (%s)" , event . summary , start . toLocaleDateString ()); return ; } // Events that don't last all day; they have defined start times. const start = new Date ( event . start . dateTime ); console . log ( "%s (%s)" , event . summary , start . toLocaleString ()); } pageToken = events . nextPageToken ; } while ( pageToken ); properties . setProperty ( "syncToken" , events . nextSyncToken ); } Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- CalendarList . list ({ maxResults : 100 , pageToken : pageToken , }); if ( ! calendars . items calendars . items . length === 0 ) { console . log ( "No calendars found." ); return ; } // Print the calendar id and calendar summary for ( const calendar of calendars . items ) { console . log ( "%s (ID: %s)" , calendar . summary , calendar . id ); } pageToken = calendars . nextPageToken ; } while ( pageToken ); } Listing events The following example demonstrates how to list the next 10 upcoming events in the user's default calendar. advanced/calendar.gs View on GitHub / Lists the next 10 upcoming events in the user's default calendar. @see https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/v3/reference/events/list / function listNext10Events () { const calendarId = "primary" ; const now = new Date (); const events = Calendar .
- The following example makes use of the same getRelativeDate(daysOffset, hour) method defined in the preceding examples. advanced/calendar.gs View on GitHub / Retrieve and log events from the given calendar that have been modified since the last sync.
- Use Calendar.Colors.get() for the full list. colorId : 11 , }; try { // call method to insert/create new event in provided calandar event = Calendar .
