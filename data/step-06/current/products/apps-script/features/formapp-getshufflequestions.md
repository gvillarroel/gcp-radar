Evidence snippets:
- For more information on the types of dialogs you can open, see the guide to dialogs and sidebars . function onOpen () { const ui = SpreadsheetApp . getUi (); // Or DocumentApp, SlidesApp or FormApp. ui . createMenu ( 'Custom Menu' ) . addItem ( 'First item' , 'menuItem1' ) . addSeparator () . addSubMenu ( ui . createMenu ( 'Sub-menu' ) . addItem ( 'Second item' , 'menuItem2' )) . addToUi (); } function menuItem1 () { SpreadsheetApp . getUi () // Or DocumentApp, SlidesApp or FormApp. . alert ( 'You clicked the first menu item!' ); } function menuItem2 () { SpreadsheetApp . getUi () // Or DocumentApp, SlidesApp or FormApp. . alert ( 'You clicked the second menu item!' ); } A document, spreadsheet, presentation, or form can only contain one menu with a given name.
- Custom menus in Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms Apps Script can add new menus in Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms, with each menu item tied to a function in a script. (In Forms, custom menus are visible only to an editor who opens the form to modify it, not to a user who opens the form to respond.) Only bound scripts can create menus.
- The most common example is running a script from a custom menu item in Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, or Google Forms, but script functions can also be triggered by clicking on images and drawings in Sheets.
- Clickable images and drawings in Sheets You can also assign an Apps Script function to an image or drawing in Sheets, provided the script is bound to the spreadsheet.

### Installable Triggers \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 106
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Time-driven triggers let scripts execute at a particular time or on a recurring interval, as frequently as every minute or as infrequently as once per month. (An add-on can use a time-driven trigger once per hour at most.) The time might be slightly randomized—for example, if you create a recurring 9 AM trigger, Apps Script chooses a time between 9 AM and 10 AM, then keeps that timing consistent from day to day so that 24 hours elapse before the trigger fires again.

- For example, a standalone script can programmatically create an installable trigger for an arbitrary Google Sheets file by calling TriggerBuilder.forSpreadsheet(key) and passing in the spreadsheet's ID.
- There are several installable triggers for Google Workspace applications: An installable open trigger runs when a user opens a spreadsheet, document, or form that they have permission to edit.
