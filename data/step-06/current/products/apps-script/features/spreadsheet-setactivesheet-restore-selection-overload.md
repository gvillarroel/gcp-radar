Evidence snippets:
- Cannot open other spreadsheets ( SpreadsheetApp.openById() or SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl() ).
- If each cell required its own function call, the operation would take considerably more time, since the Apps Script server would have to download and parse the XML feed each time. / Show the title and date for the first page of posts on the Developer blog. @return Two columns of data representing posts on the Developer blog. @customfunction / function getBlogPosts () { var array = []; var url = 'https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/atom.xml' ; var xml = UrlFetchApp . fetch ( url ). getContentText (); var document = XmlService . parse ( xml ); var root = document . getRootElement (); var atom = XmlService . getNamespace ( 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' ); var entries = document . getRootElement (). getChildren ( 'entry' , atom ); for ( var i = 0 ; i < entries . length ; i ++ ) { var title = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'title' , atom ). getText (); var date = entries [ i ]. getChild ( 'published' , atom ). getValue (); array . push ([ title , date ]); } return array ; } These techniques can be applied to nearly any custom function that is used repeatedly throughout a spreadsheet, although the implementation details vary depending on the function's behavior.
- Consequently, they can only call services that don't have access to personal data, specifically the following: Supported services Notes Cache Works, but not particularly useful in custom functions HTML Can generate HTML, but can't display it (rarely useful) JDBC Language Lock Works, but not particularly useful in custom functions Maps Can calculate directions, but not display maps Properties getUserProperties() only gets the properties of the spreadsheet owner.
- Note: While Apps Script supports standard JSDoc for autocomplete in the editor, the Google Sheets UI has specific limitations regarding which tags and syntax are displayed in the spreadsheet's formula helper. / Multiplies the input value by 2. @param {number} input The value to multiply. @return {number} The input multiplied by 2. @customfunction / function DOUBLE ( input ) { return input 2 ; } Advanced This section covers advanced custom function topics.

Evidence snippets:
- In the following example, if an empty cell is selected, the onSelectionChange(e) function sets the cell's background to red. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when the selection changes in the spreadsheet. @param {Event} e The onSelectionChange event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#onselectionchangee / function onSelectionChange ( e ) { // Set background to red if a single empty cell is selected. const range = e . range ; if ( range . getNumRows () === 1 && range . getNumColumns () === 1 && range . getCell ( 1 , 1 ). getValue () === "" ) { range . setBackground ( "red" ); } } doGet(e) and doPost(e) The doGet(e) trigger runs automatically when a user visits a web app or a program sends an HTTP GET request to a web app. doPost(e) runs when a program sends an HTTP POST request to a web app.
- For example, the onEdit(e) function below sets a comment on the cell that records the last time it was edited. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / The event handler triggered when editing the spreadsheet. @param {Event} e The onEdit event. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers#onedite / function onEdit ( e ) { // Set a comment on the edited cell to indicate when it was changed. const range = e . range ; range . setNote ( Last modified: ${ new Date () } ); } The onEdit() trigger only queues up to 2 trigger events. onSelectionChange(e) The onSelectionChange(e) trigger runs automatically when a user changes the selection in a spreadsheet.
- Getting started To use a simple trigger, create a function that uses one of these reserved function names: onOpen(e) runs when a user opens a spreadsheet, document, presentation, or form that the user has permission to edit. onInstall(e) runs when a user installs an Editor add-on from within Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms. onEdit(e) runs when a user changes a value in a spreadsheet. onSelectionChange(e) runs when a user changes the selection in a spreadsheet. doGet(e) runs when a user visits a web app or a program sends an HTTP GET request to a web app. doPost(e) runs when a program sends an HTTP POST request to a web app.
- SpreadsheetApp . getUi () // Or DocumentApp, SlidesApp, or FormApp. . createMenu ( "Custom Menu" ) . addItem ( "First item" , "menuItem1" ) . addToUi (); } onInstall(e) The onInstall(e) trigger runs automatically when a user installs an Editor add-on from within Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms.
