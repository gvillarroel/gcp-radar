### Installable Triggers \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- URL: [https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 204
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- If you have previously stored the ID of a trigger, delete it by passing the ID as an argument to the following function. triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / Deletes a trigger. @param {string} triggerId The Trigger ID. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable / function deleteTrigger ( triggerId ) { // Loop over all triggers. const allTriggers = ScriptApp . getProjectTriggers (); for ( let index = 0 ; index < allTriggers . length ; index ++ ) { // If the current trigger is the correct one, delete it. if ( allTriggers [ index ]. getUniqueId () === triggerId ) { ScriptApp . deleteTrigger ( allTriggers [ index ]); break ; } } } Before creating a trigger, verify that the associated function has all the necessary OAuth permissions .
- Time-driven triggers let scripts execute at a particular time or on a recurring interval, as frequently as every minute or as infrequently as once per month. (An add-on can use a time-driven trigger once per hour at most.) The time might be slightly randomized—for example, if you create a recurring 9 AM trigger, Apps Script chooses a time between 9 AM and 10 AM, then keeps that timing consistent from day to day so that 24 hours elapse before the trigger fires again.
- For both simple and installable triggers, Apps Script passes the triggered function an event object that contains information about the context in which the event occurred.
- To create this trigger from a standalone script, replace SpreadsheetApp.getActive() with a call to SpreadsheetApp.openById(id) . triggers/triggers.gs View on GitHub / Creates a trigger for when a spreadsheet opens. @see https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable / function createSpreadsheetOpenTrigger () { const ss = SpreadsheetApp . getActive (); ScriptApp . newTrigger ( "myFunction" ). forSpreadsheet ( ss ). onOpen (). create (); } To programmatically modify an existing installable trigger, you must delete it and create a new one.

### Custom Menus in Google Workspace \_|\_ Apps Script \_|\_ Google for Developers

- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Custom menus in Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms Apps Script can add new menus in Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Forms, with each menu item tied to a function in a script. (In Forms, custom menus are visible only to an editor who opens the form to modify it, not to a user who opens the form to respond.) Only bound scripts can create menus.
- The most common example is running a script from a custom menu item in Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, or Google Forms, but script functions can also be triggered by clicking on images and drawings in Sheets.
- Clickable images and drawings in Sheets You can also assign an Apps Script function to an image or drawing in Sheets, provided the script is bound to the spreadsheet.
- Images and drawings in Google Sheets can also have Apps Script functions assigned to them to run when clicked.
