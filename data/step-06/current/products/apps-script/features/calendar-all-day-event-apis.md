- Events . list ( calendarId , { timeMin : now . toISOString (), singleEvents : true , orderBy : "startTime" , maxResults : 10 , }); if ( ! events . items events . items . length === 0 ) { console . log ( "No events found." ); return ; } for ( const event of events . items ) { if ( event . start . date ) { // All-day event. const start = new Date ( event . start . date ); console . log ( "%s (%s)" , event . summary , start . toLocaleDateString ()); continue ; } const start = new Date ( event . start . dateTime ); console . log ( "%s (%s)" , event . summary , start . toLocaleString ()); } } Conditionally modifying an event The following example shows how to conditionally update a Calendar event using the If-Match header.
