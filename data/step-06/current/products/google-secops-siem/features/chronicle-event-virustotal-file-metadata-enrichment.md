Evidence snippets:
- The following examples show supported boolean operators ( AND , OR , and NOT ): A AND B A OR B Use parentheses ( ) to group expressions and control evaluation order: (A OR B) AND (B OR C) AND (C OR NOT D) Examples: Search for login events on the finance server: metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN" and target.hostname = "finance-svr" Use the operator (>) to search for connections where more than 10 MB of data was sent: metadata.event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" and network.sent bytes > 10000000 Use multiple conditions to search for winword.exe launching cmd.exe or powershell.exe : metadata.event type = "PROCESS LAUNCH" and principal.process.file.full path = /winword/ and ( target.process.file.full path = /cmd.exe/ or target.process.file.full path = /powershell.exe/ ) Search key-value pairs in additional and labels fields: The additional and labels fields act as customizable containers for event data that doesn't map to standard UDM fields.
- For example: additional.fields["key"]="value" Examples of searches using specific key-value pairs in the additional and labels fields: Search for events containing specified key-value pairs: additional.fields["pod name"] = "kube-scheduler" metadata.ingestion labels["MetadataKeyDeletion"] = "startup-script" Use the AND operator with key-value pair searches: additional.fields["pod name"] = "kube-scheduler" AND additional.fields["pod name1"] = "kube-scheduler1" Search for all events that contain the specified key, regardless of the value: additional.fields["pod name"] != "" Search for events that contain a specific key, using a regular expression: additional.fields.value.string value = "mystring" Note: You can also use value.bool value or value.number value for boolean and numeric matches.
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- Supported fields You can download the following fields to a CSV file from the platform: user hostname process name event type timestamp raw log (valid only when raw logs are enabled for the customer) All fields starting with udm.additional Valid field types You can download the following field types to a CSV file: double float int32 uint32 int64 uint64 bool string enum bytes google.protobuf.Timestamp google.protobuf.Duration Unsupported fields Fields that start with "udm" (not udm.additional) and meet either of the following conditions cannot be downloaded to CSV: The nesting of the field is more than 10 deep in udm proto.

Evidence snippets:
- Invalid. $host over 3h after $e1 condition: $e1 and $e2 } Login example using outcome section The following example uses the outcome section to calculate a risk score for the detection. rule Detection { meta: events: $auth.metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN" $auth.metadata.vendor name = "Acme" $auth.metadata.product name = "Acme SSO" $auth.target.user.userid = $user $auth.metadata.event timestamp.seconds > $context.graph.entity.user.termination date.seconds $context.graph.metadata.vendor name = "Microsoft" $context.graph.metadata.product name = "Azure Active Directory" $context.graph.metadata.entity type = "USER" $context.graph.entity.user.userid = $user $context.graph.entity.user.termination date.seconds > 0 match: $user over 15m outcome: $risk score = max( if ( $auth.metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN", 50) + if ( $context.graph.entity.user.title = "Remote" nocase or $context.graph.entity.user.title = "Temp" nocase or $context.graph.entity.user.title = "Vendor" nocase, 40) + if ( $context.graph.entity.user.title = "Legal" nocase, 10) ) condition: $auth and $context } Suspicious process launch example The following example evaluates UDM event process data against IOC context data stored as an entity context. rule ProcessLaunch { meta: events: $ioc.graph.metadata.vendor name = "ACME" $ioc.graph.metadata.product name = "IOCs" $ioc.graph.metadata.entity type = "FILE" $ioc.graph.entity.file.sha256 = $hash $process.metadata.event type = "PROCESS LAUNCH" $process.principal.hostname = $hostname ( not $process.target.process.file.sha256 = "" and $process.target.process.file.sha256 = $hash ) match: $hash over 15m condition: $ioc and $process } Additional qualifiers for entity context To create an event variable that uses an entity context, you must provide a <source> after the event name.
- It is looking for times when someone with administrator privilege attempted to sign in to or log out of the system. rule LoginLogout { meta: events: ($log inout.metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN" or $log inout.metadata.event type = "USER LOGOUT") $log inout.principal.user.user display name = $user $context.graph.entity.user.user display name = $user $context.graph.entity.resource.attribute.roles.type = "ADMINISTRATOR" match: $user over 2m condition: $log inout and $context } Sliding window example The following sliding window example is valid. rule Detection { meta: events: $e1.graph.entity.hostname = $host $e2.udm.principal.hostname = $host match: // Using e2 (a UDM event) as a pivot. $host over 3h after $e2 condition: $e1 and $e2 } Invalid sliding window example The following sliding window example is invalid.

- Context-aware analytics incorporates advanced enrichment capabilities earlier in the detection authoring and execution workflow, enabling you to provide the following additional capabilities: Making relevant context available for heuristic-driven contextual risk scoring of detections at detection execution time rather than at the human triage stage Reducing time spent on triage and manually stitching together information from disparate IT security systems (EDR consoles, firewall or proxy logs, CMDB and IAM context, vulnerability scan results) Enabling analysts and detection engineers to filter out entire clusters of threats that may be expected or represent little or no danger to the enterprise (malware testing in a sandbox environment, vulnerabilities and anomalous activity in a development network with no sensitive data or access, and more) Writing rules for context-aware analytics You can use Detection Engine rules to search for entity context data in your Google SecOps account.
