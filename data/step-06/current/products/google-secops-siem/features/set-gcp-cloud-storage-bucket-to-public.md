Evidence snippets:
- The following export filter exports Google Cloud Cloud Run ( GCP RUN ) logs, in addition to the default logs both through the direct ingestion mechanism as well as through Cloud Storage and Sinks : log id("run.googleapis.com/stdout") OR log id("run.googleapis.com/stderr") OR log id("run.googleapis.com/requests") OR log id("run.googleapis.com/varlog/system) Curated detections for AWS rule sets AWS rule sets in this category help identify threats in AWS environments using event and context data, and includes the following rule sets: AWS - Compute : Detects anomalous activity surrounding AWS compute resources, including EC2 and Lambda.
- AWS - Data : Detects AWS activity associated with data resources, including RDS snapshots or S3 buckets made publicly available.
- Curated detections for Office 365 data Office 365 rule sets in this category help identify threats in Office 365 environments using event and context data, and includes the following rule sets: Office 365 - Administrative : Detects malicious, suspicious and high-risk activities in Office 365, including backup policy changes, Microsoft Purview, and ATP detections.
- You can ingest AWS data using an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket as a source type or, optionally, using Amazon S3 with Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).

Evidence snippets:
- Configure VPC Service Controls If VPC Service Controls is enabled, both ingress and egress rules are required to provide access to the Cloud Storage bucket.
- Sample egress rule "egressPolicies" : [ { "egressFrom": { "identities": [ "serviceAccount:service-{replace with project id}@gs-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com" ] } , "egressTo" : { "operations" : [ { "methodSelectors": [ { "method": " " } ] , "serviceName" : "pubsub.googleapis.com" } ] , "resources" : [ " " ] } , "title" : "GCS pubsub access" } , { "egressFrom" : { "identities" : [ "serviceAccount:project-{replace with project id}@storage-transfer-service.iam.gserviceaccount.com" ] } , "egressTo" : { "operations" : [ { "methodSelectors": [ { "method": " " } ] , "serviceName" : "pubsub.googleapis.com" } ] , "resources" : [ " " ] } , "title" : "STS pubsub" } ] Enable STS access for Amazon S3 and Azure Storage The STS is used by the following Google Cloud Storage feeds to transfer data from Amazon S3 and Azure Storage blobstores to Google SecOps: Amazon S3 (V2) Amazon SQS (V2) Azure Blob Storage (V2) STS sends data transfer requests to the Amazon S3 and Azure storage services from a set of defined STS IP address ranges.
- Sample ingress rule - ingressFrom: identities: - serviceAccount:8911409095528497-0-account@partnercontent.gserviceaccount.com sources: - accessLevel: " " ingressTo: operations: - serviceName: storage.googleapis.com methodSelectors: - method: google.storage.objects.list - method: google.storage.objects.get - method: google.storage.objects.delete resources: - projects/PROJECT ID Egress rules The following egress rules must be allowed for feeds using GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE V2 , GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE EVENT DRIVEN , AMAZON S3 V2 , AMAZON SQS V2 , and AZURE BLOBSTORE V2 to operate when VPCSC is enabled.
- Ingress rules The following Cloud Storage methods must be allowed in the ingress rule: google.storage.objects.list : Required for a single file feed. google.storage.objects.get : Required for feeds that require directory or subdirectory access. google.storage.objects.delete : Required for feeds that require deletion of the source file.

Evidence snippets:
- Suspicious user activities occurring within your environment A security analyst receives an alert that a user has suddenly initiated a large data transfer to an external cloud storage service after several failed login attempts, raising suspicion of a potential account compromise or unauthorized data transfer.
- Curated Detections & Prioritization : Pre-built detection rules (available in rule packs like "Applied Threat Intelligence - Curated Prioritization") contextualize IOC matches using event data and Mandiant intelligence features to generate prioritized alerts (Active Breach, High, Medium, Inbound IP Auth).
- Measure effectiveness of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies An administrator can measure the effectiveness of DLP rules by reviewing aggregate data to ensure that “block” and “warn” policies applied through Chrome are addressing threats and not preventing legitimate work.
- For example, an enriched alert concerning an AWS S3 bucket may contain additional information about the bucket such as the region, the owner, and metadata tags surrounding the bucket even if that information wasn’t present in the source alert.
