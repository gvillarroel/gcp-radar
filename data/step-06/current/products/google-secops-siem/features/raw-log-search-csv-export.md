- Final score: 115
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- Click an entity to display the Entity context dialog, which can include the following items: Asset name First time seen Last time seen IP addresses MAC addresses Number of alerts Highest alert count by rule Alerts-over-time bar graph Open Alerts & IOCs link View in Alerts Tab link Use the Pivot Table to analyze events The Pivot Table lets you analyze events using expressions and functions against the results from the search.
- Use a block comment: additional.fields["pod name"] = "kube-scheduler" / Block comments can span multiple lines. / AND additional.fields["pod name1"] = "kube-scheduler1" Use a single-line comment: additional.fields["pod name"] != "" // my single-line comment Search settings You can set the maximum number of search results in UDM search settings .
- Searching for text in Values returns results as follows: If the string is found at the beginning or end of the value, it is highlighted in the result, along with the UDM field name and the log ingestion time.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- SIEM Log Searching and Investigation : During a CDIR investigation, or on an ad-hoc basis, analysts can use either natural language syntax, Yara-L syntax, or raw log searching to surface information in various logs ingested into Google SecOps related to cloud infrastructure and services.
- Google SecOps provides Cloud Detection Investigation and Response (CDIR), Case Management, SIEM log searching and investigation, Cloud Asset Inventory collection for Entity Graph Enrichment, and the ability to automate common SOC workflows using the SOAR component of Google SecOps.
- Centralized Investigation: The IOC Matches page serves as the central hub for viewing matched IOCs, filtering results (by Type, Priority, Status, Source: Mandiant, etc.), and drilling down into event details, UDM context, threat intelligence rationale, and associations.
- Proactive Threat Hunting: Utilize GTI feeds and insights within Google SecOps search and detection rules (YARA-L) to proactively hunt for emerging threats and specific attacker TTPs within your environment.

- When to use composite detections Composite detections can be useful for achieving the following goals: Correlate outcomes of two or more rules (for example, linking a Malware Downloaded detection with a subsequent C2 Beaconing alert from the same host).
- The rule then searches raw Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs (the events ) from the same workload within a one-minute window, looking for command-line operations that contained the same malicious domain.
- Tip: To prevent accidentally matching prior detection results when testing, consider adding a unique meta: label to each rule within the composite chain.
