Evidence snippets:
- November 01, 2022 Change The Ingestion API udmevents and createentities methods now accept both uppercase and lowercase characters in the following fields: < Noun >.mac : defined when calling the udmeevents method, where Noun is either principal, src, target, observer, intermediary, or about. entity.asset.mac : defined when calling the createentities method.
- When you navigate or search for events in UDM Events Explore, the results appear instantly and field names are easy to identify.
- When you use UDM Events Explore, user experience is improved by removing unused and rarely used fields.
- September 08, 2025 Announcement New parser documentation now available New parser documentation is available to help you ingest and normalize logs from the following sources: Collect Akamai Cloud Monitor logs Collect Akamai DataStream 2 logs Collect Aware audit logs Collect AWS API Gateway access logs Collect AWS VPC Transit Gateway flow logs Collect Bitwarden Enterprise event logs Collect Box Collaboration JSON logs Collect Censys logs Collect Code42 Incydr core datasets Collect CSV Custom IOC files Collect Deep Instinct EDR logs Collect DigiCert audit logs Collect DomainTools Iris Investigate results Collect Duo administrator logs Collect Duo authentication logs Collect Duo entity context logs Collect Google Cloud Abuse Events logs Collect Harness IO audit logs Collect HPE Aruba Networking Central logs Collect Jamf Pro context logs Collect PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud logs Collect Slack audit logs Collect Snyk group-level audit logs Collect Snyk group-level audit and issues logs Collect Venafi Zero Touch PKI logs Collect Veritas NetBackup logs Collect VMware AirWatch logs Collect VMware Avi Load Balancer WAF logs Collect VMware Horizon logs Collect VMware VeloCloud SD-WAN logs Collect Zoom operation logs September 05, 2025 Change Advanced filtering in alerts and search results You can now filter alerts and search results by any field in the detection object.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- The following examples show supported boolean operators ( AND , OR , and NOT ): A AND B A OR B Use parentheses ( ) to group expressions and control evaluation order: (A OR B) AND (B OR C) AND (C OR NOT D) Examples: Search for login events on the finance server: metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN" and target.hostname = "finance-svr" Use the operator (>) to search for connections where more than 10 MB of data was sent: metadata.event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" and network.sent bytes > 10000000 Use multiple conditions to search for winword.exe launching cmd.exe or powershell.exe : metadata.event type = "PROCESS LAUNCH" and principal.process.file.full path = /winword/ and ( target.process.file.full path = /cmd.exe/ or target.process.file.full path = /powershell.exe/ ) Search key-value pairs in additional and labels fields: The additional and labels fields act as customizable containers for event data that doesn't map to standard UDM fields.
- Grouped fields and UDM fields are sorted from highest to lowest Events count , and in alphabetical order within the same Events count .
- When you adjust the time range, the UDM fields and values and Events tables update to reflect your selection.

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 128
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, when a new event arrives with only an IP address , the enrichment process uses the aliased data to find the associated hostname (for example, alex-macbook ) and populates the $udm.event.principal.hostname field.
- Re-enrichment of UDM events Underlying data changes: If the underlying data changes after an event is ingested, the system reprocesses historical data and updates events for up to 24 hours after ingestion.
- Detection rules Detection rules examine both regular and entity Universal Data Model (UDM) events, which are normalized raw logs, to generate detections according to the rule's specifications.
- The system performs multiple enrichment runs, and enrichment can update UDM events up to 24 hours after the event has been ingested.
