Evidence snippets:
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- The following examples show supported boolean operators ( AND , OR , and NOT ): A AND B A OR B Use parentheses ( ) to group expressions and control evaluation order: (A OR B) AND (B OR C) AND (C OR NOT D) Examples: Search for login events on the finance server: metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN" and target.hostname = "finance-svr" Use the operator (>) to search for connections where more than 10 MB of data was sent: metadata.event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" and network.sent bytes > 10000000 Use multiple conditions to search for winword.exe launching cmd.exe or powershell.exe : metadata.event type = "PROCESS LAUNCH" and principal.process.file.full path = /winword/ and ( target.process.file.full path = /cmd.exe/ or target.process.file.full path = /powershell.exe/ ) Search key-value pairs in additional and labels fields: The additional and labels fields act as customizable containers for event data that doesn't map to standard UDM fields.
- Search for events and alerts Supported in: Google secops SIEM The search function lets you find Unified Data Model (UDM) events and alerts in your Google Security Operations instance using YARA-L 2.0 syntax .
- You can search for individual UDM events and groups of UDM events that match the same query.
