Evidence snippets:
- A dashboard widget then shows which users are approaching a daily egress limit (for example, 10,000 bytes).
- By setting a rule to detect only and then plotting its detections in a dashboard widget, you can track trends, identify outliers, and gain a high-level audit view of the activity without being overwhelmed by individual alerts.
- Example : rule CheckCuratedDetection with EDR and EG { meta: author = "noone@cymbal.com" events: $d.detection.detection.rule name = /SCC: Custom Modules: Configurable Bad Domain/ $d.detection.collection elements.references.event.network.dns.questions.name = $domain $d.detection.collection elements.references.event.principal.asset.hostname = $hostname $e.metadata.log type = "LIMACHARLIE EDR" $e.metadata.product event type = "NETWORK CONNECTIONS" $domain = re.capture($e.principal.process.command line, "\\s([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+)$") $hostname = re.capture($e.principal.hostname, "([^.] )") $prevalence.graph.metadata.entity type = "DOMAIN NAME" $prevalence.graph.metadata.source type = "DERIVED CONTEXT" $prevalence.graph.entity.hostname = $domain $prevalence.graph.entity.domain.prevalence.day count = 10 $prevalence.graph.entity.domain.prevalence.rolling max <= 5 $prevalence.graph.entity.domain.prevalence.rolling max > 0 match: $hostname over 1h outcome: $risk score = 80 $CL target = array($domain) condition: $e and $d and $prevalence } View composite detection findings You can view composite detection results in the Detections page.
- Tip: Because the number of outcome variables is limited to 20, we recommend establishing a common taxonomy of outcome variables (such as hostname , ip address , user , and file bytes ) to reuse consistently across a wide range of rules.

Evidence snippets:
- Verify the ingestion of Azure data The Google SecOps Data Ingestion and Health dashboard lets you see information about the type, volume, and health of all data being ingested into Google SecOps using SIEM ingestion features.
- Google Workspace-related rule sets The following rule sets detect patterns in Google Workspace data: Potential Insider Data Exfiltration from Chrome Potential Insider Data Exfiltration from Drive Potential Insider Data Exfiltration from Gmail Potential Workspace Account Compromise Suspicious Workspace Administrative Actions These rule sets require the following log types, listed by product name and Google SecOps ingestion label: Workspace Activities ( WORKSPACE ACTIVITY ) Workspace Alerts ( WORKSPACE ALERTS ) Workspace ChromeOS Devices ( WORKSPACE CHROMEOS ) Workspace Mobile Devices ( WORKSPACE MOBILE ) Workspace Users ( WORKSPACE USERS ) Google Chrome Browser Cloud Management ( CHROME MANAGEMENT ) Gmail logs ( GMAIL LOGS ) To ingest the required data, do the following: Collect the data listed in the All rule sets section of this document.
- The following log data, listed by product name and Google SecOps ingestion label: BigQuery ( GCP BIGQUERY CONTEXT ) Compute Engine ( GCP COMPUTE CONTEXT ) IAM ( GCP IAM CONTEXT ) Sensitive Data Protection ( GCP DLP CONTEXT ) Cloud Audit Logs ( GCP CLOUDAUDIT ) Google Workspace Activity ( WORKSPACE ACTIVITY ) Cloud DNS queries ( GCP DNS ) The following Security Command Center finding classes , listed by findingClass identifier and Google SecOps ingestion label: Threat ( GCP SECURITYCENTER THREAT ) Misconfiguration ( GCP SECURITYCENTER MISCONFIGURATION ) Vulnerability ( GCP SECURITYCENTER VULNERABILITY ) SCC Error ( GCP SECURITYCENTER ERROR ) The CDIR SCC Enhanced rule sets also depend on data from Google Cloud services.
- The following export filter exports Google Cloud Cloud Run ( GCP RUN ) logs, in addition to the default logs both through the direct ingestion mechanism as well as through Cloud Storage and Sinks : log id("run.googleapis.com/stdout") OR log id("run.googleapis.com/stderr") OR log id("run.googleapis.com/requests") OR log id("run.googleapis.com/varlog/system) Curated detections for AWS rule sets AWS rule sets in this category help identify threats in AWS environments using event and context data, and includes the following rule sets: AWS - Compute : Detects anomalous activity surrounding AWS compute resources, including EC2 and Lambda.

- Final score: 101
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The following permissions apply to Dashboards: chronicle.dashboards.list : Lets users see the list of available dashboards. chronicle.dashboards.get : Lets users open and view a dashboard content. chronicle.dashboards.create : Lets users create new dashboards. chronicle.dashboards.update : Lets users edit and save changes to existing dashboards. chronicle.dashboards.delete : Lets users delete custom dashboards.
- Data RBAC overview Supported in: Google secops SIEM Data role-based access control ( data RBAC ) is a security model that uses individual user roles to restrict user access to data within an organization.
- For example, a junior analyst might have access to only view dashboards but not to create or modify detection rules, while a senior analyst might have the permissions to create and manage detection rules.
- Restricted viewer roles/chroniclesiem.restrictedViewer Similar to the Viewer role, but all data displayed in the dashboard is filtered according to the user's assigned log scope (Data RBAC).
