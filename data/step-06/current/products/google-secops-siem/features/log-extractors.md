Evidence snippets:
- The scope assignment lets you restrict access to these events to specific users or roles within your organization.
- Assigning specific scopes to users determines the data that they can view and interact with.
- To filter and identify these specific events, you can create a custom label with the name Suspicious DHCP Activity with the following query: metadata.event type = "NETWORK DHCP" AND principal.ip = "10.0.0.1" The custom label works in the following manner: Google SecOps continuously ingests network logs and events into its UDM.
- Functional limitations Custom Label query don't support the following advanced features: Reference lists Enrichment fields Data tables Query execution time : Custom label query is subject to a maximum execution time limit of 5 seconds.

Evidence snippets:
- The following table outlines the different file sizes that Google SecOps feeds transformation supports: Operation Input type Recommended size Expected duration Max size Data Modeling CSV 10 GB Data Modeling CSV 30 min 10 GB Data Modeling CSV TBD TBD 2 GB Data Modeling XML / JSON 2 GB Data Modeling XLS / XLSX 1 min 50 MB Merge Files Any Varies on number of files 100 GB Decompress Files Non-ZIP Varies on number of files 10 GB (uncompressed) Decompress Files ZIP - Varies on number of files 4 GB (uncompressed) Log line limits and delimiters When ingesting text-based logs (JSON, CSV, or Syslog), ensure your data adheres to these specific ingestion limits: Maximum Line Size : A single log line cannot exceed 4MB .
- Control the rate of ingestion When the data ingestion rate for a tenant reaches a certain threshold, Google Security Operations restricts the rate of ingestion for new data feeds to prevent a source with a high ingestion rate from affecting the ingestion rate of another data source.
- These STS IP address ranges are published in the following JSON file: IP ranges To use these STS feed source types, you may need to adjust IP access restrictions to enable STS to access your Amazon S3 and Azure storage services: Pull the latest IP ranges from the JSON file.
- What to expect during migration For impacted feeds, you will observe the following changes: Feed Status : Feeds created prior to the migration will immediately stop pulling live data and will become read-only.

Evidence snippets:
- Types of grouped UDM fields You can search across all of the following grouped UDM fields: Grouped field name Associated UDM fields domain about.administrative domain about.asset.network domain network.dns.questions.name network.dns domain principal.administrative domain principal.asset.network domain target.administrative domain target.asset.hostname target.asset.network domain target.hostname email intermediary.user.email addresses network.email.from network.email.to principal.user.email addresses security result.about.user.email addresses target.user.email addresses file path principal.file.full path principal.process.file.full path principal.process.parent process.file.full path target.file.full path target.process.file.full path target.process.parent process.file.full path hash about.file.md5 about.file.sha1 about.file.sha256 principal.process.file.md5 principal.process.file.sha1 principal.process.file.sha256 security result.about.file.sha256 target.file.md5 target.file.sha1 target.file.sha256 target.process.file.md5 target.process.file.sha1 target.process.file.sha256 hostname intermediary.hostname observer.hostname principal.asset.hostname principal.hostname src.asset.hostname src.hostname target.asset.hostname target.hostname ip intermediary.ip observer.ip principal.artifact.ip principal.asset.ip principal.ip src.artifact.ip src.asset.ip src.ip target.artifact.ip target.asset.ip target.ip namespace principal.namespace src.namespace target.namespace process id principal.process.parent process.pid principal.process.parent process.product specific process id principal.process.pid principal.process.product specific process id target.process.parent process.pid target.process.parent process.product specific process id target.process.pid target.process.product specific process id user about.user.userid observer.user.userid principal.user.user display name principal.user.userid principal.user.windows sid src.user.userid target.user.user display name target.user.userid target.user.windows sid Find a UDM field for search query While writing a search query, you may not know which UDM field to include.
- For example: additional.fields["key"]="value" Examples of searches using specific key-value pairs in the additional and labels fields: Search for events containing specified key-value pairs: additional.fields["pod name"] = "kube-scheduler" metadata.ingestion labels["MetadataKeyDeletion"] = "startup-script" Use the AND operator with key-value pair searches: additional.fields["pod name"] = "kube-scheduler" AND additional.fields["pod name1"] = "kube-scheduler1" Search for all events that contain the specified key, regardless of the value: additional.fields["pod name"] != "" Search for events that contain a specific key, using a regular expression: additional.fields.value.string value = "mystring" Note: You can also use value.bool value or value.number value for boolean and numeric matches.
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- When searching Values , UDM Lookup does not return matches in the following cases: Matches in the following UDM fields: metadata.product log id network.session id security result.rule id network.parent session id Matches in UDM fields with a full path that ends in one of the following values: .pid For example target.process.pid . .asset id For example principal.asset id . .product specific process id For example principal.process.product specific process id . .resource.id For example principal.resource.id .
