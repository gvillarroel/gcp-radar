Evidence snippets:
- The following examples show supported boolean operators ( AND , OR , and NOT ): A AND B A OR B Use parentheses ( ) to group expressions and control evaluation order: (A OR B) AND (B OR C) AND (C OR NOT D) Examples: Search for login events on the finance server: metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN" and target.hostname = "finance-svr" Use the operator (>) to search for connections where more than 10 MB of data was sent: metadata.event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" and network.sent bytes > 10000000 Use multiple conditions to search for winword.exe launching cmd.exe or powershell.exe : metadata.event type = "PROCESS LAUNCH" and principal.process.file.full path = /winword/ and ( target.process.file.full path = /cmd.exe/ or target.process.file.full path = /powershell.exe/ ) Search key-value pairs in additional and labels fields: The additional and labels fields act as customizable containers for event data that doesn't map to standard UDM fields.
- For example: additional.fields["key"]="value" Examples of searches using specific key-value pairs in the additional and labels fields: Search for events containing specified key-value pairs: additional.fields["pod name"] = "kube-scheduler" metadata.ingestion labels["MetadataKeyDeletion"] = "startup-script" Use the AND operator with key-value pair searches: additional.fields["pod name"] = "kube-scheduler" AND additional.fields["pod name1"] = "kube-scheduler1" Search for all events that contain the specified key, regardless of the value: additional.fields["pod name"] != "" Search for events that contain a specific key, using a regular expression: additional.fields.value.string value = "mystring" Note: You can also use value.bool value or value.number value for boolean and numeric matches.
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- It then matches those events against the hostnames column and the ip column in the badApps data table. events: $e.metadata.event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" $e.security result.action = "ALLOW" $e.target.asset.asset id = $assetid // Event hostname matches at least one value in table column hostname. $e.target.hostname in %badApps.hostname // Event IP matches at least one value in table column ip. $e.target.ip in %badApps.ip For more information, see Use data tables .

- Final score: 108
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Enrichment system Google SecOps enriches UDM events by adding contextual data from other sources.
- Re-enrichment of UDM events Underlying data changes: If the underlying data changes after an event is ingested, the system reprocesses historical data and updates events for up to 24 hours after ingestion.
- Aliasing and enrichment Aliasing and enrichment are two steps in the Google SecOps security data enrichment process that correlates and adds context data to event records.
- High latency in this contextual data can cause re-enrichment processing and rule replays to interact, resulting in a delayed detection.

- Final score: 103
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Curated Detections & Prioritization : Pre-built detection rules (available in rule packs like "Applied Threat Intelligence - Curated Prioritization") contextualize IOC matches using event data and Mandiant intelligence features to generate prioritized alerts (Active Breach, High, Medium, Inbound IP Auth).
- By applying this frontline intelligence directly within Google SecOps, security teams gain unparalleled visibility and context, ensuring that security events are actively interpreted through the lens of the latest, validated threat intelligence to help you stay ahead of novel and sophisticated attacks.
- Google SecOps provides Cloud Detection Investigation and Response (CDIR), Case Management, SIEM log searching and investigation, Cloud Asset Inventory collection for Entity Graph Enrichment, and the ability to automate common SOC workflows using the SOAR component of Google SecOps.
- Since both SIEM and SOAR capabilities are front and center within the platform, there's no need anymore to send Cloud log data and related threat events outside of the platform - everything is included under the umbrella heading of Google Unified Security.
