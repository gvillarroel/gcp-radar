Evidence snippets:
- Curated detections for Office 365 data Office 365 rule sets in this category help identify threats in Office 365 environments using event and context data, and includes the following rule sets: Office 365 - Administrative : Detects malicious, suspicious and high-risk activities in Office 365, including backup policy changes, Microsoft Purview, and ATP detections.
- The following export filter exports Google Cloud Cloud Run ( GCP RUN ) logs, in addition to the default logs both through the direct ingestion mechanism as well as through Cloud Storage and Sinks : log id("run.googleapis.com/stdout") OR log id("run.googleapis.com/stderr") OR log id("run.googleapis.com/requests") OR log id("run.googleapis.com/varlog/system) Curated detections for AWS rule sets AWS rule sets in this category help identify threats in AWS environments using event and context data, and includes the following rule sets: AWS - Compute : Detects anomalous activity surrounding AWS compute resources, including EC2 and Lambda.
- Curated detections for Google Cloud data Google Cloud rule sets help identify threats in Google Cloud environments using event and context data, and includes the following rule sets: Admin Action : Activity associated with administrative actions, deemed suspicious but potentially legitimate depending on organizational use.
- The following log data, listed by product name and Google SecOps ingestion label: BigQuery ( GCP BIGQUERY CONTEXT ) Compute Engine ( GCP COMPUTE CONTEXT ) IAM ( GCP IAM CONTEXT ) Sensitive Data Protection ( GCP DLP CONTEXT ) Cloud Audit Logs ( GCP CLOUDAUDIT ) Google Workspace Activity ( WORKSPACE ACTIVITY ) Cloud DNS queries ( GCP DNS ) The following Security Command Center finding classes , listed by findingClass identifier and Google SecOps ingestion label: Threat ( GCP SECURITYCENTER THREAT ) Misconfiguration ( GCP SECURITYCENTER MISCONFIGURATION ) Vulnerability ( GCP SECURITYCENTER VULNERABILITY ) SCC Error ( GCP SECURITYCENTER ERROR ) The CDIR SCC Enhanced rule sets also depend on data from Google Cloud services.

- Optionally, enrich them with events, metrics, and a wide range of contextual data from the entity graph, such as prevalence data, threat intelligence, or an entity risk score.
- A rule designed for risk often aggregates multiple contextual events or detections to make a judgment.
- By setting a rule to detect only and then plotting its detections in a dashboard widget, you can track trends, identify outliers, and gain a high-level audit view of the activity without being overwhelmed by individual alerts.

Evidence snippets:
- Context-aware analytics incorporates advanced enrichment capabilities earlier in the detection authoring and execution workflow, enabling you to provide the following additional capabilities: Making relevant context available for heuristic-driven contextual risk scoring of detections at detection execution time rather than at the human triage stage Reducing time spent on triage and manually stitching together information from disparate IT security systems (EDR consoles, firewall or proxy logs, CMDB and IAM context, vulnerability scan results) Enabling analysts and detection engineers to filter out entire clusters of threats that may be expected or represent little or no danger to the enterprise (malware testing in a sandbox environment, vulnerabilities and anomalous activity in a development network with no sensitive data or access, and more) Writing rules for context-aware analytics You can use Detection Engine rules to search for entity context data in your Google SecOps account.
- Comparing entity contexts to other entity contexts Comparing entity contexts to UDM events Repeated fields in entity contexts Sliding windows Calculating a risk score for detections Note: Entity context cannot be used as the pivot for a sliding window.
- Invalid. $host over 3h after $e1 condition: $e1 and $e2 } Login example using outcome section The following example uses the outcome section to calculate a risk score for the detection. rule Detection { meta: events: $auth.metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN" $auth.metadata.vendor name = "Acme" $auth.metadata.product name = "Acme SSO" $auth.target.user.userid = $user $auth.metadata.event timestamp.seconds > $context.graph.entity.user.termination date.seconds $context.graph.metadata.vendor name = "Microsoft" $context.graph.metadata.product name = "Azure Active Directory" $context.graph.metadata.entity type = "USER" $context.graph.entity.user.userid = $user $context.graph.entity.user.termination date.seconds > 0 match: $user over 15m outcome: $risk score = max( if ( $auth.metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN", 50) + if ( $context.graph.entity.user.title = "Remote" nocase or $context.graph.entity.user.title = "Temp" nocase or $context.graph.entity.user.title = "Vendor" nocase, 40) + if ( $context.graph.entity.user.title = "Legal" nocase, 10) ) condition: $auth and $context } Suspicious process launch example The following example evaluates UDM event process data against IOC context data stored as an entity context. rule ProcessLaunch { meta: events: $ioc.graph.metadata.vendor name = "ACME" $ioc.graph.metadata.product name = "IOCs" $ioc.graph.metadata.entity type = "FILE" $ioc.graph.entity.file.sha256 = $hash $process.metadata.event type = "PROCESS LAUNCH" $process.principal.hostname = $hostname ( not $process.target.process.file.sha256 = "" and $process.target.process.file.sha256 = $hash ) match: $hash over 15m condition: $ioc and $process } Additional qualifiers for entity context To create an event variable that uses an entity context, you must provide a <source> after the event name.
