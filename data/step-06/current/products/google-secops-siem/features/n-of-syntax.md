- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-required-1`
- Final score: 115
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The condition editor provides a text-based interface to manually enter an expression using CEL syntax .
- Note: Conditional role bindings don't override role bindings with no conditions.
- Adding the principal to a conditional binding for the same role has no effect.
- Custom Label requirements and limitations We recommend that you review the following limits and requirements when you define and use custom labels: Naming and syntax requirements Custom Label names must be unique and can have a maximum length of 63 characters.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-required-1`
- Final score: 105
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Define the condition section to set the condition that must be met for the final alert to fire.
- Example : rule CheckCuratedDetection with EDR and EG { meta: author = "noone@cymbal.com" events: $d.detection.detection.rule name = /SCC: Custom Modules: Configurable Bad Domain/ $d.detection.collection elements.references.event.network.dns.questions.name = $domain $d.detection.collection elements.references.event.principal.asset.hostname = $hostname $e.metadata.log type = "LIMACHARLIE EDR" $e.metadata.product event type = "NETWORK CONNECTIONS" $domain = re.capture($e.principal.process.command line, "\\s([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+)$") $hostname = re.capture($e.principal.hostname, "([^.] )") $prevalence.graph.metadata.entity type = "DOMAIN NAME" $prevalence.graph.metadata.source type = "DERIVED CONTEXT" $prevalence.graph.entity.hostname = $domain $prevalence.graph.entity.domain.prevalence.day count = 10 $prevalence.graph.entity.domain.prevalence.rolling max <= 5 $prevalence.graph.entity.domain.prevalence.rolling max > 0 match: $hostname over 1h outcome: $risk score = 80 $CL target = array($domain) condition: $e and $d and $prevalence } View composite detection findings You can view composite detection results in the Detections page.
- Enhance detection accuracy : Combine insights from Unified Data Model (UDM) events, rule detections, entity context, User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) findings, and data tables to build more accurate detection logic.
- Add a second condition to provide additional qualification, such as "alert only if this detection happens 5 times for the same user in one hour" or if it's combined with a detection from a different rule.

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/investigation/udm-search](https://docs.cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/investigation/udm-search)
- Source ID: `site-api-reference`
- Final score: 89
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The following examples show supported boolean operators ( AND , OR , and NOT ): A AND B A OR B Use parentheses ( ) to group expressions and control evaluation order: (A OR B) AND (B OR C) AND (C OR NOT D) Examples: Search for login events on the finance server: metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN" and target.hostname = "finance-svr" Use the operator (>) to search for connections where more than 10 MB of data was sent: metadata.event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" and network.sent bytes > 10000000 Use multiple conditions to search for winword.exe launching cmd.exe or powershell.exe : metadata.event type = "PROCESS LAUNCH" and principal.process.file.full path = /winword/ and ( target.process.file.full path = /cmd.exe/ or target.process.file.full path = /powershell.exe/ ) Search key-value pairs in additional and labels fields: The additional and labels fields act as customizable containers for event data that doesn't map to standard UDM fields.
- Supported fields You can download the following fields to a CSV file from the platform: user hostname process name event type timestamp raw log (valid only when raw logs are enabled for the customer) All fields starting with udm.additional Valid field types You can download the following field types to a CSV file: double float int32 uint32 int64 uint64 bool string enum bytes google.protobuf.Timestamp google.protobuf.Duration Unsupported fields Fields that start with "udm" (not udm.additional) and meet either of the following conditions cannot be downloaded to CSV: The nesting of the field is more than 10 deep in udm proto.
- For example: principal.process.file.full path = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Application\\chrome.exe" target.process.command line = "cmd.exe /c \"c:\\program files\\a.exe\"" Boolean expressions : Use AND , OR , and NOT to combine conditions and narrow results.
- Grouped fields can also be used in combination with regular UDM fields as shown in the following example: ip = "5.6.7.8" AND metadata.event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" Grouped fields have a separate section in Aggregations .
