- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Example SQL to query for specific IP-address IOC matches: -- Add your IP IOC Matches here DECLARE IP IOCS ARRAY < STRING > ; SET IP IOCS = [ '40.79.150.120' ]; ------ SELECT MIN ( DATE ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( CAST ( day bucket seconds AS INT64 )), 'UTC' )) AS first observed , MAX ( DATE ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( CAST ( day bucket seconds AS INT64 )), 'UTC' )) AS last observed , COUNT ( 4 ) AS hits , ioc value , feed log type , is global , CONCAT ( COALESCE ( asset . namespace , "untagged" ), ":" , COALESCE ( asset . hostname , asset . asset ip address , asset . mac , "-" )) AS asset FROM datalake . ioc matches WHERE ioc value IN UNNEST ( IP IOCS ) AND ioc type = "IOC TYPE IP" GROUP BY 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 Here are the truncated results: Row first observed last observed hits ioc value feed log type is global asset 1 2025-02-23 2025-03-05 64 40.79.150.120 CATCH ALL false untagged:192.168.12.16 2 2025-02-27 2025-03-05 29 40.79.150.120 CATCH ALL false untagged:192.168.12.129 You can also query the datalake.events table for multi-dimensional IOC matching by constructing a concatenated string, for example: DECLARE IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES ARRAY < STRING > ; SET IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES = [ '1.2.3.4,80' , '1.2.3.4,443' ]; SELECT MIN ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( metadata . event timestamp . seconds )) AS first seen , MAX ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( metadata . event timestamp . seconds )) AS last seen , target ip , target . port FROM datalake . events , UNNEST ( target . ip ) target ip WHERE DATE ( hour time bucket ) BETWEEN DATE SUB ( CURRENT DATE , INTERVAL 60 DAY ) AND DATE SUB ( CURRENT DATE , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) AND target ip != "" AND target . port > 0 AND CONCAT ( target ip , "," , CAST ( target . port AS STRING )) IN UNNEST ( IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES ) GROUP BY 3 , 4 Note: The Google SecOps Data Lake typically retains data for six months.
- The following threat-intelligence sources are available in Google SecOps out-of-box: Google SecOps Enterprise package Google SecOps Enterprise Plus package Enriched open-source intelligence (OSINT) Enriched open-source intelligence (OSINT) Mandiant Fusion VirusTotal Real-time and retroactive matching Google SecOps performs IOC matching in two ways: Real-time matching : when new security telemetry is ingested and normalized, it is immediately checked against all available IOC feeds.
- An entity graph can use two contexts: Google-provided context ( GLOBAL CONTEXT ) : Google SecOps pre-populates the entity graph with feeds like GCTI, Safe Browsing, and VirusTotal, which are labeled with source type = "GLOBAL CONTEXT" .
- These feeds, such as MISP IOC , are normalized and included in the same IOC matching process, enabling you to correlate your security data with indicators that are relevant to your organization.

Evidence snippets:
- Proactive Threat Hunting: Utilize GTI feeds and insights within Google SecOps search and detection rules (YARA-L) to proactively hunt for emerging threats and specific attacker TTPs within your environment.
- Centralized Investigation: The IOC Matches page serves as the central hub for viewing matched IOCs, filtering results (by Type, Priority, Status, Source: Mandiant, etc.), and drilling down into event details, UDM context, threat intelligence rationale, and associations.
- Native Threat Feeds : Natively integrated threat intelligence feeds from Mandiant, VirusTotal, SafeBrowsing, and more, enable users to create their own custom detections and scoring methodologies.
