Evidence snippets:
- Example SQL to query for specific IP-address IOC matches: -- Add your IP IOC Matches here DECLARE IP IOCS ARRAY < STRING > ; SET IP IOCS = [ '40.79.150.120' ]; ------ SELECT MIN ( DATE ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( CAST ( day bucket seconds AS INT64 )), 'UTC' )) AS first observed , MAX ( DATE ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( CAST ( day bucket seconds AS INT64 )), 'UTC' )) AS last observed , COUNT ( 4 ) AS hits , ioc value , feed log type , is global , CONCAT ( COALESCE ( asset . namespace , "untagged" ), ":" , COALESCE ( asset . hostname , asset . asset ip address , asset . mac , "-" )) AS asset FROM datalake . ioc matches WHERE ioc value IN UNNEST ( IP IOCS ) AND ioc type = "IOC TYPE IP" GROUP BY 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 Here are the truncated results: Row first observed last observed hits ioc value feed log type is global asset 1 2025-02-23 2025-03-05 64 40.79.150.120 CATCH ALL false untagged:192.168.12.16 2 2025-02-27 2025-03-05 29 40.79.150.120 CATCH ALL false untagged:192.168.12.129 You can also query the datalake.events table for multi-dimensional IOC matching by constructing a concatenated string, for example: DECLARE IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES ARRAY < STRING > ; SET IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES = [ '1.2.3.4,80' , '1.2.3.4,443' ]; SELECT MIN ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( metadata . event timestamp . seconds )) AS first seen , MAX ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( metadata . event timestamp . seconds )) AS last seen , target ip , target . port FROM datalake . events , UNNEST ( target . ip ) target ip WHERE DATE ( hour time bucket ) BETWEEN DATE SUB ( CURRENT DATE , INTERVAL 60 DAY ) AND DATE SUB ( CURRENT DATE , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) AND target ip != "" AND target . port > 0 AND CONCAT ( target ip , "," , CAST ( target . port AS STRING )) IN UNNEST ( IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES ) GROUP BY 3 , 4 Note: The Google SecOps Data Lake typically retains data for six months.
- You can view information about the IOCs, such as type, priority, status, categories, assets, campaigns, sources, IOC ingest time, first seen, and last seen.
