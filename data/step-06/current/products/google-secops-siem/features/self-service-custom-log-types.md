Evidence snippets:
- To filter and identify these specific events, you can create a custom label with the name Suspicious DHCP Activity with the following query: metadata.event type = "NETWORK DHCP" AND principal.ip = "10.0.0.1" The custom label works in the following manner: Google SecOps continuously ingests network logs and events into its UDM.
- Create and manage custom labels Custom labels are metadata that you can add to the SIEM ingested Google SecOps data to categorize and organize it based on UDM-normalized values.
- Create and manage scopes You can create and manage data scopes within the Google SecOps user interface, and then assign those scopes to users or groups through IAM.
- Optional: Create custom labels: create custom labels (in addition to the default labels ) to categorize your data.
