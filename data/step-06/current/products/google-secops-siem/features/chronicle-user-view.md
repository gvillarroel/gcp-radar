- Data RBAC overview Supported in: Google secops SIEM Data role-based access control ( data RBAC ) is a security model that uses individual user roles to restrict user access to data within an organization.
- Predefined scoped read-only access Chronicle API Restricted Data Access ( roles/chronicle.restrictedDataAccess ) and Chronicle API Restricted Data Access Viewer ( roles/chronicle.restrictedDataAccessViewer ) Chronicle API Restricted Data Access Viewer Custom scoped access Chronicle API Restricted Data Access ( roles/chronicle.restrictedDataAccess ) and custom role (for feature RBAC definition) Custom permissions within features Custom global access chronicle.globalDataAccessScopes.permit permission and Chronicle API Global Data Access ( roles/globalDataAccess ) Global permissions within features The following is a description of each access type presented in the table: Predefined global access: this access is typically required for users who need access to all the data.
- The following permissions apply to Dashboards: chronicle.dashboards.list : Lets users see the list of available dashboards. chronicle.dashboards.get : Lets users open and view a dashboard content. chronicle.dashboards.create : Lets users create new dashboards. chronicle.dashboards.update : Lets users edit and save changes to existing dashboards. chronicle.dashboards.delete : Lets users delete custom dashboards.
- Restricted viewer roles/chroniclesiem.restrictedViewer Similar to the Viewer role, but all data displayed in the dashboard is filtered according to the user's assigned log scope (Data RBAC).

- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- When searching Values , UDM Lookup displays Possible value match when a match is found in the following cases: Matches in the following UDM fields: metadata.description security result.description security result.detection fields.value security result.summary network.http.user agent Matches in fields with a full path that ends in one of the following values: .command line For example principal.process.command line . .file.full path For example principal.process.file.full path . .labels.value For example src.labels.value . .registry.registry key For example principal.registry.registry key . .url For example principal.url .
