- This asset metadata is drawn from your Cloud Asset Inventory and consists of information about your assets, resources, and identities including the following: Environment Location Zone Hardware models Access control relationships between resources and identities The following types of Google Cloud asset metadata will be exported to your Google SecOps instance: GCP BIGQUERY CONTEXT GCP COMPUTE CONTEXT GCP IAM CONTEXT GCP IAM ANALYSIS GCP STORAGE CONTEXT GCP CLOUD FUNCTIONS CONTEXT GCP SQL CONTEXT GCP NETWORK CONNECTIVITY CONTEXT GCP RESOURCE MANAGER CONTEXT The following are examples of Google Cloud asset metadata: Application name— Google-iamSample/0.1 Project name— projects/my-project Note: You need to have either Security Command Center Standard or Security Command Center Premium enabled to export Google Cloud asset metadata to Google SecOps.
- To ingest logs from an additional organization to the same Google SecOps instance, select the organization from the Organization menu, and then repeat the steps to define the type of data to export and export filters.
- Export filter examples The following export filter examples illustrate how you can include or exclude certain types of logs from the export to your Google SecOps instance.

Evidence snippets:
- Curated Detections & Prioritization : Pre-built detection rules (available in rule packs like "Applied Threat Intelligence - Curated Prioritization") contextualize IOC matches using event data and Mandiant intelligence features to generate prioritized alerts (Active Breach, High, Medium, Inbound IP Auth).
- Measure effectiveness of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies An administrator can measure the effectiveness of DLP rules by reviewing aggregate data to ensure that “block” and “warn” policies applied through Chrome are addressing threats and not preventing legitimate work.
- Proactive Threat Hunting: Utilize GTI feeds and insights within Google SecOps search and detection rules (YARA-L) to proactively hunt for emerging threats and specific attacker TTPs within your environment.
- Getting Started Enable Curated Detections: Activate the Applied Threat Intelligence curated detections rule packs within Google SecOps to enable alerting and prioritization.
