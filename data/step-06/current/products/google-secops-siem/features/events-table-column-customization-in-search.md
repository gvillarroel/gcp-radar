- Source ID: `site-api-reference`
- Final score: 218
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- Click an entity to display the Entity context dialog, which can include the following items: Asset name First time seen Last time seen IP addresses MAC addresses Number of alerts Highest alert count by rule Alerts-over-time bar graph Open Alerts & IOCs link View in Alerts Tab link Use the Pivot Table to analyze events The Pivot Table lets you analyze events using expressions and functions against the results from the search.
- It then matches those events against the hostnames column and the ip column in the badApps data table. events: $e.metadata.event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" $e.security result.action = "ALLOW" $e.target.asset.asset id = $assetid // Event hostname matches at least one value in table column hostname. $e.target.hostname in %badApps.hostname // Event IP matches at least one value in table column ip. $e.target.ip in %badApps.ip For more information, see Use data tables .
- Search for events and alerts Supported in: Google secops SIEM The search function lets you find Unified Data Model (UDM) events and alerts in your Google Security Operations instance using YARA-L 2.0 syntax .

Evidence snippets:
- The following example uses a data table called connections watchlist with columns ip and port : rule ioc ip4 and port matches { meta : description = "Matches on IP address and port using a data table" events : $ioc . metadata . event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" $ioc . target . ip = $dip $ioc . target . port = $dport // row-based join: both ip and port must match same row in data table "connections watchlist" %connections watchlist . ip = $dip %connections watchlist . port = $dport match : $dip , $dport over 5 m condition : $ioc } BigQuery for historical IOC analysis The datalake.ioc matches table in Google SecOps's data lake (BigQuery) provides a powerful way to query historical IOC match data.
- Example: YARA-L rule matching IPs from a data table column rule ioc ip4 matches { meta : description = "IOC IPv4 matching using data tables" events : $ ioc . metadata . event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" $ ioc . target . ip = $ dip // checks if the IP address is in the ip address column of data table "string demo list" $ dip in % string demo list . ip address condition : $ ioc } For multi-dimensional matching (for example, IP address + port), you can use row-based comparison against a data table with multiple columns.
- Example SQL to query for specific IP-address IOC matches: -- Add your IP IOC Matches here DECLARE IP IOCS ARRAY < STRING > ; SET IP IOCS = [ '40.79.150.120' ]; ------ SELECT MIN ( DATE ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( CAST ( day bucket seconds AS INT64 )), 'UTC' )) AS first observed , MAX ( DATE ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( CAST ( day bucket seconds AS INT64 )), 'UTC' )) AS last observed , COUNT ( 4 ) AS hits , ioc value , feed log type , is global , CONCAT ( COALESCE ( asset . namespace , "untagged" ), ":" , COALESCE ( asset . hostname , asset . asset ip address , asset . mac , "-" )) AS asset FROM datalake . ioc matches WHERE ioc value IN UNNEST ( IP IOCS ) AND ioc type = "IOC TYPE IP" GROUP BY 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 Here are the truncated results: Row first observed last observed hits ioc value feed log type is global asset 1 2025-02-23 2025-03-05 64 40.79.150.120 CATCH ALL false untagged:192.168.12.16 2 2025-02-27 2025-03-05 29 40.79.150.120 CATCH ALL false untagged:192.168.12.129 You can also query the datalake.events table for multi-dimensional IOC matching by constructing a concatenated string, for example: DECLARE IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES ARRAY < STRING > ; SET IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES = [ '1.2.3.4,80' , '1.2.3.4,443' ]; SELECT MIN ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( metadata . event timestamp . seconds )) AS first seen , MAX ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( metadata . event timestamp . seconds )) AS last seen , target ip , target . port FROM datalake . events , UNNEST ( target . ip ) target ip WHERE DATE ( hour time bucket ) BETWEEN DATE SUB ( CURRENT DATE , INTERVAL 60 DAY ) AND DATE SUB ( CURRENT DATE , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) AND target ip != "" AND target . port > 0 AND CONCAT ( target ip , "," , CAST ( target . port AS STRING )) IN UNNEST ( IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES ) GROUP BY 3 , 4 Note: The Google SecOps Data Lake typically retains data for six months.
- Example YARA-L rule using GLOBAL CONTEXT : rule google safebrowsing process launch { meta : author = "noam@" description = "Detects Process Launch events against Critical or High severity Google's SafeBrowsing database." events : $e . metadata . event type = "PROCESS LAUNCH" $e . target . process . file . sha256 = $hash $g . graph . metadata . entity type = "FILE" $g . graph . entity . file . sha256 = $hash $g . graph . metadata . source type = "GLOBAL CONTEXT" $g . graph . metadata . threat . severity = "CRITICAL" or $g . graph . metadata . threat . severity = "HIGH" match : $hash over 10 m condition : $e and $g } IOC matching with data tables and YARA-L rules You can use data tables within YARA-L rules to match against lists of IOCs.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The scope assignment lets you restrict access to these events to specific users or roles within your organization.
- To filter and identify these specific events, you can create a custom label with the name Suspicious DHCP Activity with the following query: metadata.event type = "NETWORK DHCP" AND principal.ip = "10.0.0.1" The custom label works in the following manner: Google SecOps continuously ingests network logs and events into its UDM.
- Functional limitations Custom Label query don't support the following advanced features: Reference lists Enrichment fields Data tables Query execution time : Custom label query is subject to a maximum execution time limit of 5 seconds.
- Configure data RBAC for users Supported in: Google secops SIEM This page describes how data role-based access control ( data RBAC ) administrators can configure data RBAC within Google Security Operations.
