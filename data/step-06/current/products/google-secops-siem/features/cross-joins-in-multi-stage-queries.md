# Cross joins in multi-stage queries

Product: Google SecOps SIEM
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Cross joins in YARA-L 2.0 multi-stage queries compare individual UDM events against aggregated statistics from earlier stages.

## Extended Definition

Evidence snippets:
- Functions Supported in: Google secops SIEM This section describes the YARA-L 2.0 functions that you can use in Rules, Search, and Dashboard queries.
- You can use YARA-L to search for UDM events across all of the IP addresses within a subnetwork using the net.ip in range cidr() statement.
- In UDM search, grouped fields are used to search across multiple fields of a similar type.
- Param data types INT FLOAT , BOOL Return type FLOAT Code samples Example 1 This example returns the median when the input values aren't zero. rule median file size { meta: events: $e.metadata.event type = "FILE COPY" $userid = $e.principal.user.userid match: $userid over 1h outcome: $median file size = window.median($e.principal.file.size) // returns 2 if the file sizes in the match window are [1, 2, 3] condition: $e } Example 2 This example returns the median when the input includes some zero values that shouldn't be ignored. rule median file size { meta: events: $e.metadata.event type = "FILE COPY" $userid = $e.principal.user.userid match: $userid over 1h outcome: $median file size = window.median($e.principal.file.size) // returns 1 if the file sizes in the match window are [0,0, 1, 2, 3] condition: $e } Example 3 This example returns the median when the input includes some zero values which should be ignored. rule median file size { meta: events: $e.metadata.event type = "FILE COPY" $userid = $e.principal.user.userid match: $userid over 1h outcome: $median file size = window.median($e.principal.file.size, true) // returns 2 if the file sizes in the match window are [0,0, 1, 2, 3] condition: $e } Example 4 This example returns the median when the input includes all zero values which should be ignored. rule median file size { meta: events: $e.metadata.event type = "FILE COPY" $userid = $e.principal.user.userid match: $userid over 1h outcome: $median file size = window.median($e.principal.file.size) // returns 0 if the file sizes in the match window are [0,0] condition: $e } Example 5 This example shows that, when there are multiple medians, only one median is returned. rule median file size { meta: events: $e.metadata.event type = "FILE COPY" $userid = $e.principal.user.userid match: $userid over 1h outcome: $median file size = window.median($e.principal.file.size) // returns 1 if the file sizes in the match window are [1, 2, 3, 4] condition: $e } window.mode Supported in: Rules window.mode(values) Description Return the mode of the input values.

- Source ID: `site-api-reference`
- Final score: 131
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- Search limits and quotas Google SecOps enforces limits on search queries to ensure platform stability and consistent performance across programmatic and web interface.
- You can use them to query multiple UDM fields at the same time without typing each field individually.
- Complex queries: Queries that span more than 1 day, use multiple sources, or include stats.

- Source ID: `site-api-reference`
- Final score: 110
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- These rules detect complex, multistage threats that individual rules can miss.
- Example: YARA-L rule matching IPs from a data table column rule ioc ip4 matches { meta : description = "IOC IPv4 matching using data tables" events : $ ioc . metadata . event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" $ ioc . target . ip = $ dip // checks if the IP address is in the ip address column of data table "string demo list" $ dip in % string demo list . ip address condition : $ ioc } For multi-dimensional matching (for example, IP address + port), you can use row-based comparison against a data table with multiple columns.
- However, it doesn't support complex OR logic across multiple distinct groups (for example, (IP1 AND Port1) OR (IP2 AND Port2) ).
- Example SQL to query for specific IP-address IOC matches: -- Add your IP IOC Matches here DECLARE IP IOCS ARRAY < STRING > ; SET IP IOCS = [ '40.79.150.120' ]; ------ SELECT MIN ( DATE ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( CAST ( day bucket seconds AS INT64 )), 'UTC' )) AS first observed , MAX ( DATE ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( CAST ( day bucket seconds AS INT64 )), 'UTC' )) AS last observed , COUNT ( 4 ) AS hits , ioc value , feed log type , is global , CONCAT ( COALESCE ( asset . namespace , "untagged" ), ":" , COALESCE ( asset . hostname , asset . asset ip address , asset . mac , "-" )) AS asset FROM datalake . ioc matches WHERE ioc value IN UNNEST ( IP IOCS ) AND ioc type = "IOC TYPE IP" GROUP BY 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 Here are the truncated results: Row first observed last observed hits ioc value feed log type is global asset 1 2025-02-23 2025-03-05 64 40.79.150.120 CATCH ALL false untagged:192.168.12.16 2 2025-02-27 2025-03-05 29 40.79.150.120 CATCH ALL false untagged:192.168.12.129 You can also query the datalake.events table for multi-dimensional IOC matching by constructing a concatenated string, for example: DECLARE IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES ARRAY < STRING > ; SET IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES = [ '1.2.3.4,80' , '1.2.3.4,443' ]; SELECT MIN ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( metadata . event timestamp . seconds )) AS first seen , MAX ( TIMESTAMP SECONDS ( metadata . event timestamp . seconds )) AS last seen , target ip , target . port FROM datalake . events , UNNEST ( target . ip ) target ip WHERE DATE ( hour time bucket ) BETWEEN DATE SUB ( CURRENT DATE , INTERVAL 60 DAY ) AND DATE SUB ( CURRENT DATE , INTERVAL 1 DAY ) AND target ip != "" AND target . port > 0 AND CONCAT ( target ip , "," , CAST ( target . port AS STRING )) IN UNNEST ( IOC MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES ) GROUP BY 3 , 4 Note: The Google SecOps Data Lake typically retains data for six months.
