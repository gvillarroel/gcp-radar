Evidence snippets:
- What's next To upgrade existing apps to only allow secure traffic for TLS versions 1.2 and later, see Secure your app with minimum TLS .
- Upgrade your applications to use TLS version 1.2 and later.
- Example: myserver.key.pem Example: openssl rsa -in myserver.key -out myserver.key.pem Concatenate all of the .crt files from your CA into one file, using the following command: cat [ MY DOMAIN CERT ] . crt [ MY SecureServerCA ] . crt [ MY TrustCA ] . crt [ MY TrustExternalCARoot ] . crt > [ MY CONCAT CERT ] . crt where [MY DOMAIN CERT].crt is the certificate for your domain.
- To move from your own SSL certificates to Google-managed SSL certificates, or to add managed SSL certificates to an existing app with a custom domain, update your domain mapping: In the Google Cloud console, go to App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains : Go to Custom Domains Select the domain you want to secure, and click Enable managed security .

Evidence snippets:
- The following example illustrates how to catch the OverQuotaError , which may be raised by the SendMessage() method if an email-related quota has been exceeded: try: mail.SendMessage ( to = 'test@example.com' , from = 'admin@example.com' , subject = 'Test Email' , body = 'Testing' ) except apiproxy errors.OverQuotaError, message: Log the error. logging.error(message) Display an informative message to the user. self.response.out.write ( 'The email could not be sent. ' 'Please try again later.' ) Is your app exceeding the default limits?
- Limit Free app Paid app Maximum services per app 5 210 Maximum versions per app 15 210 There is also a limit to the number of instances for each service with basic or manual scaling: Maximum instances per manual/basic scaling version Free app Paid app US Paid app EU 20 25 (200 for us-central ) 25 There is also a limit to the number of instances across standard versions that can be running per project and region.
- This includes: data received by the application in secure requests and non-secure requests uploads to the Blobstore data received in response to HTTP requests by the URL fetch service Secure outgoing bandwidth The amount of data sent by the application over a secure connection in response to requests.
- This includes: data served in response to both secure requests and non-secure requests by application servers, static file servers, or the Blobstore data sent in email messages data in outgoing HTTP requests sent by the URL fetch service.

- Final score: 68
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Python example handlers : - url : /youraccount/. secure : always script : auto To target a specific version of your app using the REGION ID .r.appspot.com domain, you replace the periods that would usually separate the subdomain components of the URL with the string " -dot- ", for example: https:// VERSION ID -dot-default-dot- PROJECT ID .
- Example The following is an example of an app.yaml file: runtime : python314 instance class : F2 env variables : BUCKET NAME : "example-gcs-bucket" handlers : Matches requests to /images/... to files in static/images/... - url : /images static dir : static/images - url : /. secure : always redirect http response code : 301 script : auto The following table provides YAML examples of available fields in an app.yaml file: Runtime and app elements Element Description app engine apis Optional.
- For more information about the possible MIME media types, see the IANA MIME Media Types website . redirect http response code Optional. redirect http response code is used with the secure setting to set the HTTP response code returned when performing a redirect required by how the secure setting is configured. redirect http response code element has the following possible values: 301 Moved Permanently response code.
- This prevents a user from accidentally submitting query data over a non-secure connection that was intended for a secure connection. always Requests for a URL that match this handler that do not use HTTPS are automatically redirected to the HTTPS URL with the same path.
