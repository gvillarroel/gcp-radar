- Final score: 77
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- The process of upgrading an existing app depends on the runtime version that your app currently uses: Go 1.11 (first-generation runtime) : You must migrate your app to the latest supported Go version .
- Go second-generation runtimes (after end of support) : To upgrade to a supported version of Go , update the app.yaml file by specifying a version of Go that you want your app to run.
- You must upgrade your applications to the latest supported runtime version to continue receiving security updates and be eligible for technical support.
- However, App Engine might block re-deployment of applications that use runtimes after their end of support date .
