Evidence snippets:
- The Cloud Quotas system does the following: Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services Restricts your consumption of those resources Provides a way to request changes to the quota value and automate quota adjustments In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that you're trying to perform fails.

- App Engine resets all resource measurements at the beginning of each calendar day (except for Stored Data, which always represents the amount of datastore storage in use).
- Each entity stored in the datastore requires the following metadata: The entity key, including the kind, the ID or key name, and the keys of the entity's ancestors.

Evidence snippets:
- When you are sure that old indexes are no longer needed, you can delete them from App Engine as follows: gcloud datastore indexes cleanup index.yaml Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- When you are testing in your local environment, you can use the gcloud emulator command to start a service that emulates Datastore before you run your app: gcloud beta emulators datastore start --data-dir DATA-DIR Use the --data-dir flag to specify the directory where the auto-generated index.yaml file will appear.
- Deploy the index configuration file To deploy the index.yaml configuration file, run the following command: gcloud app deploy index.yaml Delete unused indexes When you change or remove an index from the index configuration, the original index is not deleted from App Engine automatically.
