Evidence snippets:
- Deleting custom domains from your app In order to delete a custom domain mapping from your app, your account must have the App Engine Admin role ( roles/appengine.appAdmin ) or a custom role that contains the appengine.applications.update permission.
- In most cases, it takes only a few minutes for these changes to take effect, but in some cases it can take up to several hours, depending on the registrar and the Time-To-Live (TTL) of any previous DNS records for your domain.
- Delegating ownership to other Google Cloud users or service accounts If you need to delegate the ownership of your domain to other users or service accounts, you can add permission through the Search Console page.
- Note: Some third party CDN providers might inadvertently intercept validation requests, preventing them from reaching the App Engine app and causing the domain mapping to fail or its certificate to fail to renew.

### "Quotas and limits \_|\_ App Engine standard environment \_|\_ Google Cloud\

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-4`

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The following example illustrates how to catch the OverQuotaError , which may be raised by the SendMessage() method if an email-related quota has been exceeded: try: mail.SendMessage ( to = 'test@example.com' , from = 'admin@example.com' , subject = 'Test Email' , body = 'Testing' ) except apiproxy errors.OverQuotaError, message: Log the error. logging.error(message) Display an informative message to the user. self.response.out.write ( 'The email could not be sent. ' 'Please try again later.' ) Is your app exceeding the default limits?
- Task Queue When a task executes, its associated requests count toward the application request quotas These limits apply to all task queues: Resource Daily limit Maximum rate Task Queue management calls (using the Google Cloud console) 10,000 n/a Resource Default limit Maximum number of queues (includes both push and pull queues but not the default queue) 100 queues.
- Resource Default daily limit Maximum rate Recipients emailed 100 messages 8 messages/minute Admins emailed 5,000 mails 24 mails/minute Message body data sent 60 MB 340 KB/minute Attachments sent 2,000 attachments 8 attachments/minute Attachment data sent 100 MB 10 MB/minute You can add up to a maximum of 50 authorized senders for the Mail API.
- If you're expecting extremely high traffic levels, or for some reason your app requires particularly high quotas (for example, because of a significant product launch or large load tests), we recommend that you sign up for a support package .
