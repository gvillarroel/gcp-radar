# Cloud Load Balancing network ingress controls for App Engine

Product: App Engine standard environment Go
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

App Engine can apply network ingress controls when used behind Cloud Load Balancing so only load-balancer-routed requests are accepted.

## Extended Definition

- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- For example: To update the default service of an App Engine app to accept traffic only from Cloud Load Balancing and VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update default --ingress = internal-and-cloud-load-balancing To update a service named "internal-requests" to accept traffic only from VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update internal-requests --ingress = internal-only Egress settings Note: Egress settings are not available for the PHP runtimes.
- For each service, the value in this column shows the ingress setting as one of All (default), Internal + Load Balancing , or Internal . gcloud To view the ingress setting for a service using the gcloud CLI: gcloud app services describe SERVICE Replace SERVICE with the name of your service.
- OK This section describes how to use ingress settings to restrict network access to your App Engine app.
- Internal and Cloud Load Balancing Allows requests from the following resources: Resources allowed by the more restrictive Internal setting External Application Load Balancer Use the Internal and Cloud Load Balancing setting to accept requests from an external Application Load Balancer but not directly from the internet.

- Final score: 124
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- If your ingress controls are set to receive internal-and-cloud-load-balancing traffic, leave the default App Engine firewall rule as is ( allow ), and use Google Cloud Armor web application firewall (WAF) rules .
- Interaction with other products or services Cloud Load Balancing If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless NEGs , note the following: The load balancer does not interfere or interact with App Engine firewall rules.
- If your app interacts with Cloud Load Balancing or is connected to a VPC network, see the Interaction with other products or services section below.
- We recommend that you use ingress controls so that your app only receives requests sent from the load balancer (and the VPC if you use it).

Evidence snippets:
- For example, you can create a dispatch file to route mobile requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/mobile/ to a mobile frontend, and route worker requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/work/ to a static backend: dispatch: Send all mobile traffic to the mobile frontend. - url: " /mobile/ " service: mobile-frontend Send all work to the one static backend. - url: " /work/ " service: static-backend Deploying the dispatch file To deploy the dispatch file using gcloud, run the following command: gcloud app deploy dispatch.yaml Routing with Cloud Load Balancing Cloud Load Balancing is a separate product that enables advanced network configurations for all of your applications running on Google Cloud.
- Note the following: We recommend that you use ingress controls so that your app only receives requests sent from the load balancer (and the VPC if you use it).
- Requests that don't pass through Cloud Load Balancing are never intercepted and rerouted by the patterns that you have defined in your dispatch file: Sends the request to an available instance of a specific service and version: https:// VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT ID .
- When HTTP(S) Load Balancing is enabled for serverless apps , you can: Configure your serverless app to serve from a dedicated IPv4 or IPv6 IP address that is not shared with other services.
