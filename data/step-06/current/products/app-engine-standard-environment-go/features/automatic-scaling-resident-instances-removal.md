# Automatic scaling resident instances removal

Product: App Engine standard environment Go
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Automatic scaling no longer uses the resident instances label and instead labels all auto-scaled instances as dynamic.

## Extended Definition

Automatic scaling no longer uses the resident instances label and instead labels all auto-scaled instances as dynamic.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

Evidence snippets:
- Scaling down in automatic scaling If your app uses automatic scaling, it takes approximately 15 minutes of inactivity for the idle instances to start shutting down.
- By default, your app uses automatic scaling, which means App Engine will manage the number of idle instances.
- Scaling types App Engine supports the following scaling types , which controls how and when instances are created: Automatic (default) Basic Manual You specify the scaling type in your app's app.yaml .
- Automatic scaling settings Description Target CPU utilization Sets the CPU utilization ratio threshold to specify the CPU usage threshold at which more instances will be started to handle traffic.

Evidence snippets:
- Example automatic scaling : target cpu utilization : 0.65 min instances : 5 max instances : 100 min pending latency : 30ms max pending latency : automatic max concurrent requests : 50 basic scaling Applications that use an instance class of B1 or higher must specify either this element or manual scaling .
- The following values are available depending on your service's scaling : Automatic scaling F1 , F2 , F4 , F4 1G Default: F1 Optionally use the automatic scaling element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as minimum and maximum number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections.
- Specify this element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as setting minimum and maximum levels for number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections for a service.
- A high maximum means users might wait longer for their requests to be served (if there are pending requests and no idle instances to serve them), but your application will cost less to run. min pending latency An optional element you can set to specify the minimum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting a new instance to handle it.
