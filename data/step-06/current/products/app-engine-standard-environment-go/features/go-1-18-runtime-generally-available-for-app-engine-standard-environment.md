- An App Engine app is configured using an app.yaml file, that contains the runtime, handlers, scaling, and other general settings including environment variables.
- For example, if you name your app.yaml file service-name-app.yaml or app.standard.yaml , then you must deploy your app using either: gcloud app deploy service - name - app . yaml gcloud app deploy app . standard . yaml To learn more about structuring multiple services and app.yaml files in your app, see Structuring web services .
