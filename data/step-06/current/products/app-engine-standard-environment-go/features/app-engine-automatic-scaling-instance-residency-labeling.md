Evidence snippets:
- Scaling types App Engine supports the following scaling types , which controls how and when instances are created: Automatic (default) Basic Manual You specify the scaling type in your app's app.yaml .
- Scaling dynamic instances App Engine applications that use basic or automatic scaling are powered by any number of dynamic instances at a given time, depending on the volume of incoming requests.
- Note: For new projects you create after March 2025, App Engine sets the automatic scaling maximum instances default for standard environment deployments to 20.
- By default, your app uses automatic scaling, which means App Engine will manage the number of idle instances.

Evidence snippets:
- Example automatic scaling : target cpu utilization : 0.65 min instances : 5 max instances : 100 min pending latency : 30ms max pending latency : automatic max concurrent requests : 50 basic scaling Applications that use an instance class of B1 or higher must specify either this element or manual scaling .
- The following values are available depending on your service's scaling : Automatic scaling F1 , F2 , F4 , F4 1G Default: F1 Optionally use the automatic scaling element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as minimum and maximum number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections.
- App Engine calculates the number of instances necessary to serve your current application traffic based on scaling settings such as target cpu utilization and target throughput utilization .
- Specify this element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as setting minimum and maximum levels for number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections for a service.
