- Because several of the legacy runtimes are no longer maintained by their respective open-source communities, as an App Engine developer, you may face hard choices on whether to invest time and effort in migrating to a newer runtime or else incur growing costs to retain your app on a legacy runtime.
- For the legacy bundled services that are not available as separate products in Google Cloud, such as image processing, search, and messaging, you can use third-party providers or other workarounds as suggested in the Runtimes guide.
- To reduce runtime migration complexity, Google Cloud now supports a set of App Engine legacy bundled services and their associated APIs on second-generation runtimes, which include Python 3 , Java 11+ , Go 1.12+ , and PHP 7+ .

- Add the following settings in your appengine-web.xml file depending on the Java version: Java 25 (EE 11) <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <runtime>java25</runtime> <system-properties> <property name="appengine.use.EE11" value="true"/> </system-properties> <app-engine-apis>true</app-engine-apis> </appengine-web-app> Java 21 (EE 10) <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <runtime>java21</runtime> <system-properties> <property name="appengine.use.EE10" value="true"/> </system-properties> <app-engine-apis>true</app-engine-apis> </appengine-web-app> Java 17 (EE 8) <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0"> <runtime>java17</runtime> <system-properties> <property name="appengine.use.EE8" value="true"/> </system-properties> <app-engine-apis>true</app-engine-apis> </appengine-web-app> To specify the legacy bundled services as a dependency, add the following lines in your pom.xml file: <dependency> <groupId>com.google.appengine</groupId> <artifactId>appengine-api-1.0-sdk</artifactId> <version>2.0.31</version> <!-- or later--> </dependency> If your app uses a web.xml file, you must add the <app-engine-apis> element and set it to true : <app-engine-apis>true</app-engine-apis> To deploy your Java 25 app, run the mvn appengine:deploy command, or the gcloud app deploy /my app/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml command on a compiled and staged web application.

- Install the App Engine API JAR To use legacy bundled services in your latest supported Java app, you must use an appengine-web.xml file to configure your app (instead of an app.yaml file).

- One of the benefits App Engine standard environment's "pay for only what you need" platform as described earlier in Scaling Down is that the system autoscales the number of instances down to zero when there is no traffic.
- App Engine can automatically create and shut down instances as traffic fluctuates, or you can specify a number of instances to run regardless of the amount of traffic.
- NTP with App Engine standard environment The App Engine standard environment has network time protocol (NTP) services which use Google NTP servers.
