Evidence snippets:
- The regions are as follows: us-west2 us-east4 northamerica-northeast1 southamerica-east1 europe-west2 europe-west3 asia-south1 asia-northeast1 australia-southeast1 App Engine custom domains use a pool of shared IP addresses for all applications.
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Mapping custom domains Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
- Updating DNS records at your domain registrar Note: If you have a custom domain set up for your App Engine app and want to move it to a different Google Cloud project, you do not need to update your custom domain DNS records as these will remain fixed for the domain when you switch projects.

Evidence snippets:
- Detect application runtime environment To determine whether your code is running in production or in the local development server, you can check the value of the GAE ENV environment variable: if os.getenv('GAE ENV', '').startswith('standard'): Production in the standard environment else: Local development server Use the Mail service The local development server can send email for calls to the App Engine mail service using either an SMTP server or a local installation of Sendmail .
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Using the local development server Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- Verify that you have installed the Google Cloud CLI component that includes the App Engine extension for Python 3 ( app-engine-python ): gcloud components list If the app-engine-python component is not installed, run the following command: gcloud components install app-engine-python Locate the installation path of Google Cloud SDK by running the following command: gcloud info The command returns the root directory where you installed Google Cloud SDK, for example: Installation Root: [/Users/myname/google-cloud-sdk] Locate the dev appserver.py tool under the /bin/ folder where you installed Google Cloud CLI, for example: CLOUD SDK ROOT /bin/dev appserver.py Note the path to the dev appserver.py for later.
- The local development server also simulates the services provided by the libraries in the SDK for App Engine, including Datastore, Memcache, and Task Queues, by performing their tasks locally.
