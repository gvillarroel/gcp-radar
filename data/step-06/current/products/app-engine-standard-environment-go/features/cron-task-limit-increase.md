- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-2`
- Final score: 206
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- The following limits apply to task queues according to their type: Push Queue Limits Maximum task size 100KB Queue execution rate 500 task invocations per second per queue Maximum countdown/ETA for a task 30 days from the current date and time Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a batch 100 tasks Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a transaction 5 tasks Default maximum number of task queues 100 queues.
- Task Queue When a task executes, its associated requests count toward the application request quotas These limits apply to all task queues: Resource Daily limit Maximum rate Task Queue management calls (using the Google Cloud console) 10,000 n/a Resource Default limit Maximum number of queues (includes both push and pull queues but not the default queue) 100 queues.
- Description Limit Can be increased Maximum number of frontend instances per project and region measured over a 1 minute period Depends on selected region.
- Resource Daily limit Maximum rate UrlFetch API calls 860,000,000 calls 660,000 calls/minute UrlFetch data sent 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute UrlFetch data received 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute Networking limits The following networking limits apply to App Engine: Outbound connections per second per instance: 500 (cannot be increased) Outbound DNS resolutions per second per instance: 100 (cannot be increased) Maximum packets per second per instance: 80,000 Maximum bits per second per instance: 100,000,000 Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .

- Final score: 158
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- For example, cron scheduled tasks satisfy the admin restriction, because App Engine sets an HTTP header X-Appengine-Cron: true on the respective requests.
- However, the requests would not satisfy the required login restriction, because cron scheduled tasks are not run as any user. mime type Optional.
- Note that the scheduler might spawn a new instance before the actual maximum number of requests is reached. max pending latency The maximum amount of time that App Engine should allow a request to wait in the pending queue before starting additional instances to handle requests so that pending latency is reduced.
- The following values are available depending on your service's scaling : Automatic scaling F1 , F2 , F4 , F4 1G Default: F1 Optionally use the automatic scaling element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as minimum and maximum number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 145
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- This table compares the performance features of the three scaling types: Feature Automatic scaling Basic scaling Manual scaling Request timeout 10 minutes for HTTP requests and task queue tasks.
- Scaling and batches of requests If you are sending batches of requests to your services, for example, to a task queue for processing, a large number of instances will be created quickly.
- A service with basic scaling is configured by setting the maximum number of instances in the max instances parameter of the basic scaling setting.
- This allows tasks such as complex initializations and applications that rely on the state of the memory over time.
