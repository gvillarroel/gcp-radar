- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- All subsequent requests for this URL that contain the Accept-Encoding: gzip header will receive the gzipped data from the cache until the cache becomes invalidated (due to the content changing after the cache expires).
- Response headers that exceed this limit will return HTTP 502 errors, with logs showing upstream sent too big header while reading response header from upstream .
- All subsequent requests for this URL that don't contain the Accept-Encoding header receive uncompressed data from the cache until the cache becomes invalidated.
- If a script handler generates a response larger than this limit, the server sends back an empty response with a 500 Internal Server Error status code.

Evidence snippets:
- For resources that are required to initiate a request, when the resource is depleted, App Engine by default returns an HTTP 403 or 503 error code for the request instead of calling a request handler.
- Resource Daily limit Maximum rate UrlFetch API calls 860,000,000 calls 660,000 calls/minute UrlFetch data sent 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute UrlFetch data received 4.5 TB 3,600 MB/minute Networking limits The following networking limits apply to App Engine: Outbound connections per second per instance: 500 (cannot be increased) Outbound DNS resolutions per second per instance: 100 (cannot be increased) Maximum packets per second per instance: 80,000 Maximum bits per second per instance: 100,000,000 Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- The following example illustrates how to catch the OverQuotaError , which may be raised by the SendMessage() method if an email-related quota has been exceeded: try: mail.SendMessage ( to = 'test@example.com' , from = 'admin@example.com' , subject = 'Test Email' , body = 'Testing' ) except apiproxy errors.OverQuotaError, message: Log the error. logging.error(message) Display an informative message to the user. self.response.out.write ( 'The email could not be sent. ' 'Please try again later.' ) Is your app exceeding the default limits?
- This includes: data received by the application in secure requests and non-secure requests uploads to the Blobstore data received in response to HTTP requests by the URL fetch service Secure outgoing bandwidth The amount of data sent by the application over a secure connection in response to requests.

Evidence snippets:
- However, if mygame attempts to make a JavaScript XMLHttpRequest to myassets , it will not succeed unless the handler for myassets returns an Access-Control-Allow-Origin: response header containing the value http://mygame.uc.r.appspot.com .
- For Python, these variables are available in the os.environ dictionary: env variables : DJANGO SETTINGS MODULE : "myapp.settings" Also see the list of runtime environment variables that cannot be overwritten. error handlers Optional.
- The error code is optional; if it's not specified, the given file is the default error response for your app. file Each file entry indicates a static file that should be served in place of the generic error response.
- The error code can be one of the following: over quota Indicates the app has exceeded a resource quota timeout Served if a deadline is reached before there is a response from your app.
