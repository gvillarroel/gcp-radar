- Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Provides authentication by adding an Identity and Access Management (IAM) verification layer above your App Engine app.
- The Users API allows an App Engine app to perform the following tasks: Detect whether the current user is signed in using a Google Account.
- IAP doesn't protect against activity within a project, such as one App Engine service accessing another service in the same project.

Evidence snippets:
- Service IP range for requests sent to the App Engine standard environment IP range for requests sent to the App Engine flexible environment App Engine Cron 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32 Compute Engine instances with external IP addresses External IP address of the instance External IP address of the instance Compute Engine instances without an external IP address 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Compute Engine instances without an external IP address using Cloud NAT for outbound connections 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Cloud Scheduler jobs using App Engine HTTP and App Engine tasks in Cloud Tasks (including App Engine Task Queues) 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.2/32 Cloud Storage or Blobstore 0.1.0.30/32 Not applicable URL Fetch 0.1.0.40/32 0.1.0.40/32 Warming requests 0.1.0.3/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny Not applicable Depending on your use case, these additional instructions might apply when configuring App Engine firewall rules: Requests from newly created or updated App Engine Cron jobs sent to either the App Engine standard or flexible environment come from 0.1.0.2 .
- Requests that bypass firewall rules in this way include: Warmup requests Cloud Scheduler jobs using App Engine HTTP (including App Engine Cron ) App Engine tasks in Cloud Tasks (including App Engine Task Queues) For apps that use the App Engine standard environment and services bundled with the first generation runtimes , notifications from the legacy Mail API also bypass the firewall.
- App Engine flexible example Your app running in the flexible environment has two services: frontend service and backend service , and has a firewall configured to deny traffic by default. frontend service uses Cloud Tasks with App Engine HTTP to send messages to backend service .
- In cases where your app is configured to use other networking services or products, you might need to create rules for controlling incoming traffic in both the App Engine firewall and the firewall or security settings of other products.
