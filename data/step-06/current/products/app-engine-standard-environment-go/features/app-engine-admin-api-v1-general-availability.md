Evidence snippets:
- Because several of the legacy runtimes are no longer maintained by their respective open-source communities, as an App Engine developer, you may face hard choices on whether to invest time and effort in migrating to a newer runtime or else incur growing costs to retain your app on a legacy runtime.
- For the legacy bundled services that are not available as separate products in Google Cloud, such as image processing, search, and messaging, you can use third-party providers or other workarounds as suggested in the Runtimes guide.
- To reduce runtime migration complexity, Google Cloud now supports a set of App Engine legacy bundled services and their associated APIs on second-generation runtimes, which include Python 3 , Java 11+ , Go 1.12+ , and PHP 7+ .
