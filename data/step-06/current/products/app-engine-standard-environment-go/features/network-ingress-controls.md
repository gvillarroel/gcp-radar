# Network ingress controls

Product: App Engine standard environment Go
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Network ingress controls can restrict App Engine applications to receive only requests routed through Cloud Load Balancing.

## Extended Definition

Network ingress controls can restrict App Engine applications to receive only requests routed through Cloud Load Balancing.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

- Test the custom constraint To test the example that restricts ingress settings, deploy a connector in the project with network set to default : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create org-policy-test \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION ID \ --network = default The output is the following: Operation denied by custom org policies: ["customConstraints/custom.defaultNetworkConstraint": "Require network to not be set to default."] Example custom organization policies for common use cases The following table provides examples of custom constraints that you might find useful with Serverless VPC Access connectors: Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors can only use a specific network. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.allowlistNetworks resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.network == 'allowlisted-network'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : allowlistNetworks description : Require connectors to use a specific network.
- Network tags The following steps show how to create ingress rules that restrict a connector's access to your VPC network based on the connector network tags.
- CIDR range The following steps show how to create ingress rules that restrict a connector's access to your VPC network based on the connector's CIDR range.
- Restrict access using ingress rules Choose either network tags or CIDR ranges to control the incoming traffic to your VPC network.

Evidence snippets:
- OK This section describes how to use ingress settings to restrict network access to your App Engine app.
- For example: To update the default service of an App Engine app to accept traffic only from Cloud Load Balancing and VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update default --ingress = internal-and-cloud-load-balancing To update a service named "internal-requests" to accept traffic only from VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update internal-requests --ingress = internal-only Egress settings Note: Egress settings are not available for the PHP runtimes.
- Available ingress settings The following settings are available: Setting Description Internal Most restrictive.
- Internal and Cloud Load Balancing Allows requests from the following resources: Resources allowed by the more restrictive Internal setting External Application Load Balancer Use the Internal and Cloud Load Balancing setting to accept requests from an external Application Load Balancer but not directly from the internet.
