Evidence snippets:
- Before you can deploy your apps to the App Engine standard environment, you typically need to create or set up the following: A Google Cloud project An App Engine application A billing account Creating a project and application You can select or create a new Google Cloud project and App Engine application to create and manage a collection of settings, credentials, and your app's metadata.
- Run the following command to select a region and create an App Engine application: gcloud app create More information about App Engine locations help outline Enable billing in the Billing page of the Google Cloud console, see Enabling billing for details.
- App Engine Locations App Engine is regional , which means the infrastructure that runs your apps is located in a specific region, and Google manages it so that it is available redundantly across all of the zones within that region .

Evidence snippets:
- The regions are as follows: us-west2 us-east4 northamerica-northeast1 southamerica-east1 europe-west2 europe-west3 asia-south1 asia-northeast1 australia-southeast1 App Engine custom domains use a pool of shared IP addresses for all applications.
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Mapping custom domains Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- Using custom domains might add noticeable latency to responses that App Engine sends to your app's users in some regions.
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
