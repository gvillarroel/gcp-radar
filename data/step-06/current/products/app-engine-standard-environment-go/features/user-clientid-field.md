- Recommended role for application deployment For an account that is responsible only for deploying new versions of an app, we recommend that you grant the following roles: App Engine Deployer role ( roles/appengine.deployer ) Service Account User role ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) The Service Account User role enables the account to impersonate the default App Engine service account during the deployment process.

- Also includes "data read" and "data write" operations that read or write user-provided data.
- To display all audit logs, enter either of the following queries into the query-editor field, and then click Run query : logName:"cloudaudit.googleapis.com" protoPayload."@type"="type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog" To display the audit logs for a specific resource and audit log type, in the Query builder pane, do the following: In Resource type , select the Google Cloud resource whose audit logs you want to see.
- Available audit logs The following types of audit logs are available for App Engine: Admin Activity audit logs Includes "admin write" operations that write metadata or configuration information.
- The Private Logs Viewer role (roles/logging.privateLogViewer ) includes the permissions contained in roles/logging.viewer , plus the ability to read Data Access audit logs in the Default bucket.

### "How requests are handled \_|\_ App Engine standard environment \_|\_ Google\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/how-requests-are-handled](https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/how-requests-are-handled)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 88
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The following limits apply specifically to the use of request handlers: Limit Amount Request size 32 megabytes Response size 32 megabytes Request timeout Depends on the type of scaling your app uses Maximum total number of files (app files and static files) 10,000 total 1,000 per directory Maximum size of an application file 32 megabytes Maximum size of a static file 32 megabytes Maximum total size of all application and static files First 1 gigabyte is free $ 0.026 per gigabyte per month after first 1 gigabyte Pending request timeout 10 seconds Maximum size of a single request header field 8 kilobytes for second-generation runtimes in the standard environment.
- Response compression For responses that are returned by your code, App Engine compresses data in the response if both of the following conditions are true: The request contains the Accept-Encoding header that includes gzip as a value.
- You can also change the number of concurrent requests an instance can handle by setting the max concurrent requests element in your app.yaml file , or appengine-web.xml file file if using the App Engine legacy bundled services.
- Response caching The Google Front End, and potentially the user's browser and other intermediate caching proxy servers, will cache your app's responses as instructed by standard caching headers that you specify in the response.
