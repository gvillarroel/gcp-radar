- Generally, your app.yaml file requires only the runtime element for a simple Go 1.12+ app in the standard environment, for example: runtime : go126 App Engine provides default values for all other settings, including the F1 instance class , which determines the memory and CPU resources that are available to your app, and automatic scaling , which controls how and when new instances of your app are created.
- An App Engine app is configured using an app.yaml file, that contains the runtime, handlers, scaling, and other general settings including environment variables.

Evidence snippets:

- If warmup requests are enabled for your application, App Engine attempts to detect when your application needs a new instance and initiates a warmup request to initialize a new instance.
- Enabling warmup requests Warmup requests are used by the App Engine scheduler, which controls the auto scaling of instances based on user-supplied configuration.
- When deploying to Google App Engine, a webserver process such as Gunicorn will serve the app.
