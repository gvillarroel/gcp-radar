# Automatic scaling scheduler upgrade

Product: App Engine standard environment Go
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

App Engine automatic scaling was upgraded to improve scheduling efficiency and reduce instance costs and loading requests.

## Extended Definition

App Engine automatic scaling was upgraded to improve scheduling efficiency and reduce instance costs and loading requests.

## Evidence Summary

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The number of concurrent requests an automatic scaling instance can accept before the scheduler spawns a new instance (Default: 10, Maximum: 1000).
- Example automatic scaling : target cpu utilization : 0.65 min instances : 5 max instances : 100 min pending latency : 30ms max pending latency : automatic max concurrent requests : 50 basic scaling Applications that use an instance class of B1 or higher must specify either this element or manual scaling .
- The following values are available depending on your service's scaling : Automatic scaling F1 , F2 , F4 , F4 1G Default: F1 Optionally use the automatic scaling element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as minimum and maximum number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections.
- Specify this element to change default settings for automatic scaling, such as setting minimum and maximum levels for number of instances, latency, and concurrent connections for a service.

Evidence snippets:
- Scaling types App Engine supports the following scaling types , which controls how and when instances are created: Automatic (default) Basic Manual You specify the scaling type in your app's app.yaml .
- Automatic scaling settings Description Target CPU utilization Sets the CPU utilization ratio threshold to specify the CPU usage threshold at which more instances will be started to handle traffic.
- Scaling dynamic instances App Engine applications that use basic or automatic scaling are powered by any number of dynamic instances at a given time, depending on the volume of incoming requests.
- This table compares the performance features of the three scaling types: Feature Automatic scaling Basic scaling Manual scaling Request timeout 10 minutes for HTTP requests and task queue tasks.
