Evidence snippets:
- Outbound request timeouts For Cloud Run services and jobs, there is a timeout after 10 minutes of idle time for requests from your container to VPC .
- 1 Environment variables for worker pools Cloud Run sets the following environment variables for worker pools: Name Description Example CLOUD RUN WORKER POOL The name of the running Cloud Run worker pool. hello-world CLOUD RUN WORKER POOL REVISION The name of the running Cloud Run worker pool revision. hello-world.1 Request and response header requirements (services) For services, Cloud Run restricts header names to printable non-whitespace ASCII, and cannot contain colons.
- This restricts some network capabilities and prevents your root containers from running as "true root." Limited file system mounts from inside containers The supported path for mounting file systems in Cloud Run is through the fully managed volume mounts feature in your Cloud Run container configuration .
- Container requirements When deploying containers to Cloud Run, the following requirements must be met: Container deployed to services must listen for requests on the correct port A Cloud Run service starts Cloud Run instances to handle incoming requests.
