Evidence snippets:
- For example, when an AI agent is deployed through a managed platform like Vertex AI Agent Engine , App Hub automatically classifies the resource with the AGENT functional type value to indicate that the workload runs an AI agent. ( Preview ) Extended metadata : an schema-driven property that provides rich, structured information about the service or workload.
- You can define single-project boundaries by configuring the project as a standalone management project. (Legacy) Multiple-project boundary with a host project : For existing users, App Hub supports a legacy model where you can designate a host project for application management by enabling the App Hub API on a Google Cloud project.
- AI-powered assistance from Gemini Cloud Assist , which uses App Hub's data model to help you design, operate, and troubleshoot your applications.
- For example, workloads with a functional type value of AGENT can include apphub.googleapis.com/AgentProperties metadata, which contains information about an agent that is compatible with the Agent2Agent (A2A) Agent Card .
