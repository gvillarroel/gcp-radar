Evidence snippets:
- Register services Get information about a service using its URI: data "google apphub discovered service" "my-service" { location = " REGION " service uri = " SERVICE URI " } Register the discovered service to your application, for example: resource "google apphub service" "example" { project = "my-project-id" location = "us-central1" application id = google apphub application.example.application id service id = "frontend-load-balancer" discovered service = data.google apphub discovered service.my-forwarding-rule.name display name = "Frontend Load Balancer" description = "The primary load balancer for the frontend." } Register workloads Get information about a workload using its URI: data "google apphub discovered workload" "my-workload" { location = " REGION " workload uri = " WORKLOAD URI " } Register the discovered workload to your application, for example: resource "google apphub workload" "example" { project = "my-project-id" location = "us-central1" application id = google apphub application.example.application id workload id = "frontend-instance-group" discovered workload = data.google apphub discovered workload.my-mig.name display name = "Frontend Instance Group" description = "The managed instance group for the frontend." } The registration status of services and workloads registered to an application might change to detached if you move a project or folder out of your application management boundary or delete the underlying resource.
- List the registered services in your application: gcloud apphub applications services list \ --application = APPLICATION NAME --project = PROJECT ID \ --location = REGION You must obtain an output similar to the following for each registered service: ID DISPLAY NAME SERVICE REFERENCE CREATE TIME SERVICE NAME SERVICE DISPLAY NAME { 'uri' : '//compute.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT NUMBER /regions/ REGION /forwardingRules/forwarding-rule' } 2023 -11-01T21:38:08 Register workloads List the available workloads that you can register to an application: gcloud apphub discovered-workloads list \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --location = REGION \ --filter = FILTER EXPRESSION For required and optional flags, replace the following: Required: PROJECT ID : the ID of the management project.
- List the registered workloads in your application: gcloud apphub applications workloads list \ --application = APPLICATION NAME --project = PROJECT ID \ --location = REGION You must obtain an output similar to the following for each registered workload: ID DISPLAY NAME WORKLOAD REFERENCE CREATE TIME WORKLOAD NAME WORKLOAD DISPLAY NAME { 'uri' : '//compute.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT NUMBER /regions/ REGION /instanceGroups/mig-name' } 2023 -11-01T21:38:08 Terraform To use Terraform to register Google Cloud resources within your application management boundary as services or workloads in an application, use the google apphub discovered service and google apphub discovered workload data sources to dynamically retrieve information about the resources you want to register.
- Commands are slightly different for services and workloads: Register services List the available services that you can register to an application: gcloud apphub discovered-services list \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --location = REGION \ --filter = FILTER EXPRESSION For required and optional flags, replace the following: Required: PROJECT ID : the ID of the management project.
