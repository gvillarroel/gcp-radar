Evidence snippets:
- To identify and mitigate AlloyDB for PostgreSQL database performance issues, you can compare snapshots of system metrics between two points in time by manually generating performance snapshot reports.
- Example report The following is an abridged example of a generated performance snapshot report: Example performance snapshot report $ psql -d postgres -U alloydbsuperuser postgres=> select perfsnap.report(22, 23); report -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PGSNAP DB Report for: Snapshot details -------------------------------------- Host i841-sr-primary-2a34f46e-06bc Release 14.12 Startup Time 2024-10-08 03:23:15+00 Snap Id Snap Time ------------ ---------- ------------------------ Begin Snap: 22 24.10.2024 04:33:56 (UTC) Automatic snapshot End Snap: 23 25.10.2024 04:38:56 (UTC) Automatic snapshot Elapsed: 1 day 00:04:59.979321 Database Cache sizes Shared Buffers: 31 GB Block Size: 8192 Effective Cache Size: 25 GB WAL Buffers: 16384 Host CPU %User %Nice %System %Idle %WIO %IRQ %SIRQ %Steal %Guest ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- 1.07 0.22 0.91 97.40 0.09 0.00 0.31 0.00 0.00 Host Memory Total Memory: 63 GB Available Memory: 11 GB Free Memory: 726 MB Buffers Memory: 3706 MB Load profile (in bytes) Per Second Per Transaction ------------ --------------- Redo size: 63083.64 4489.93 Logical reads: 1961.21 139.59 ...
- To create a snapshot that also contains SQL execution statistics, follow these steps: Create the pg stat statements extension in the postgres database. postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION pg stat statements; Now, when you take a snapshot, it automatically includes the SQL statistics from pg stat statements . postgres=# select perfsnap.snap(); snap ------ 2 (1 row) Note: The output of perfsnap.snap() is the same as when creating a snapshot of only system metrics.
- This tool complements other AlloyDB observability features like systems insights , query insights , and the Metrics Explorer , which provide real-time metrics about your instance.

Evidence snippets:
- However, you can manually install Orafce to an existing AlloyDB Omni installation. pageinspect Inspects the contents of database pages at a low level. pg background Lets you run arbitrary commands in a background worker. pg bigm Provides full text search capability in PostgreSQL using 2-gram (bigram) indexes for faster full text searches.
- This extension is used along with the vector extension to enhance vector search capabilities and provides support for storing and querying vector embeddings. bloom Provides an index access method based on Bloom filters. btree gin Provides sample GIN operator classes that implement B-tree equivalent behavior. btree gist Provides GiST index operator classes that implement B-tree equivalent behavior. citext Provides a case-insensitive character string type citext . cube Implements a data type cube for representing multidimensional cubes. dblink Provides functions to connect to PostgreSQL databases from within a database session. dict int An add-on dictionary template for full-text search that controls the indexing of integers. earthdistance Provides two approaches to calculating great circle distances on the surface of the Earth. fuzzystrmatch Provides several functions to determine similarities and distance between strings. google columnar engine Provides the columnar engine feature of AlloyDB, which handles HTAP (hybrid transactional analytical processing) and OLAP (online analytical processing) workloads very efficiently.
- Important: Before you can use CREATE EXTENSION to enable this extension, you must first set the database flags alloydb.enable pglogical and alloydb.logical decoding to the value on in the AlloyDB instance where you want to use the extension. pgrowlocks Provides row locking information for the specified table. pgRouting Extends PostGIS , enabling geospatial processing through network routing and analysis. pgstattuple Provides various functions to obtain tuple-level statistics. pgtap Provides a unit testing framework for PostgreSQL, written in PL/pgSQL and PL/SQL. pgtt Adds support for global temporary tables to your databases. vector The stock pgvector PostgreSQL extension is customized for AlloyDB, and referred to as vector .
- Important: Before you can use CREATE EXTENSION to enable this extension, you must first set the database flag alloydb.enable pg squeeze to the value on in the AlloyDB instance where you want to use the extension. pg stat statements Provides a means for tracking execution statistics of all SQL statements executed. pg trgm Provides functions and operators for determining the similarity of alphanumeric text based on trigram matching, as well as index operator classes that support fast searching for similar strings. pg visibility Provides a way to examine the visibility map (VM) and the page-level visibility information of a table. pg wait sampling Provides the ability to collect sampling statistics of wait events.
