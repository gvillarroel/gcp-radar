Evidence snippets:
- Current number of GPU memory bytes used, by state Maximum amount of GPU memory, in bytes, that has been allocated by the process Percentage of time in the process lifetime that one or more kernels has been running on the GPU Percentage of time, since last sample, the GPU has been active interface Linux only Total count of network errors Total count of packets sent over the network Total number of bytes sent over the network memory Memory usage, with label for state (buffered, cached, free, slab, used) Memory usage percent, with label for state (buffered, cached, free, slab, used) network TCP connection count, with labels for port and TCP state swap Swap I/O operations, with label for direction Swap bytes used, with labels for device and state Swap percent used, with labels for device and state pagefile Windows only Current percentage of pagefile used by state processes Processes count, with label for state Processes forked count Per-process disk read I/O, with labels for process name + others Per-process disk write I/O, with labels for process name + others Per-process RSS usage, with labels for process name + others Per-process VM usage, with labels for process name + others About the gpu metrics: The hostmetrics receiver collects metrics reported by the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) as agent.googleapis.com/gpu metrics.
- This can be used to remove placeholder values, such as: httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : httpRequest.referer = "-" Sample Configurations The parse json processor would transform a JSON file containing { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } into a LogEntry structure that looks like this: { "jsonPayload" : { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } } This could then be transformed with modify fields into this LogEntry : { "httpRequest" : { "status" : 400 , "requestUrl" : "/index.html" , } } by using this Ops Agent configuration: logging : receivers : in : type : files include paths : - /var/log/http.json processors : parse json : type : parse json set http request : type : modify fields fields : httpRequest.status : move from : jsonPayload.http status type : integer httpRequest.requestUrl : move from : jsonPayload.path httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : jsonPayload.referer = "-" service : pipelines : pipeline : receivers : [ in ] processors : [ parse json , set http request ] This configuration reads JSON-formatted logs from /var/log/http.json and populates part of the httpRequest structure from fields in the logs.
- When the Ops Agent receives external structured log data, it places top-level fields into the LogEntry 's jsonPayload field unless the field name is listed in the following table: Record field LogEntry field Option 1 "timestamp": { "seconds": CURRENT SECONDS, "nanos": CURRENT NANOS, } Option 2 { "timestampSeconds": CURRENT SECONDS, "timestampNanos": CURRENT NANOS, } timestamp receiver id (not a record field) logName logging.googleapis.com/httpRequest ( HttpRequest ) httpRequest logging.googleapis.com/severity ( string ) severity logging.googleapis.com/labels ( struct of string:string ) labels logging.googleapis.com/operation ( struct ) operation logging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation ( struct ) sourceLocation logging.googleapis.com/trace ( string ) trace logging.googleapis.com/spanId ( string ) spanId Any remaining structured record fields remain part of the jsonPayload structure.
- The entire metrics configuration looks like the following: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [] The following example shows the built-in service configuration for Windows: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : - hostmetrics - iis - mssql processors : - metrics filter The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics submodule to be debug instead: metrics : service : log level : debug Collection of self logs By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.

### Collect Prometheus metrics \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

Evidence snippets:
- Setting up the example requires the following resources, which you might have to install: git curl make python3 Go language, version 1.19 or higher Create or configure your application To obtain and run the JSON Exporter, use the following procedure: Clone the json exporter repository and check out the exporter by running the following commands: git clone https://github.com/prometheus-community/json exporter.git cd json exporter git checkout v0.5.0 Build the exporter by running the following command: make build Start the Python HTTP server by running the following command: python3 -m http.server 8000 & Start the JSON Exporter by running the following command: ./json exporter --config.file examples/config.yml & Query the JSON Exporter to verify that it is running and exposing metrics on port 7979: curl "http://localhost:7979/probe?module=default&target=http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json" If the query was successful, then you see output that resembles the following: HELP example global value Example of a top-level global value scrape in the json TYPE example global value untyped example global value{environment="beta",location="planet-mars"} 1234 HELP example value active Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value active untyped example value active{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value active{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 1 HELP example value boolean Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value boolean untyped example value boolean{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value boolean{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 0 HELP example value count Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value count untyped example value count{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value count{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 3 In this output, the strings like example value active are the metric names, with labels and values in braces.
- The full structure of the Prometheus receiver is shown in the following: metrics: receivers: prom application: type: prometheus config: scrape configs: - job name: ' STRING ' # must be unique across all Prometheus receivers scrape interval: # duration, like 10m or 15s scrape timeout: # duration, like 10m or 15s metrics path: # resource path for metrics, default = /metrics honor timestamps: # boolean, default = false scheme: # http or https, default = http params: - STRING : STRING basic auth: username: STRING password: SECRET password file: STRING authorization: type: STRING # default = Bearer credentials: SECRET credentials file: FILENAME oauth2: OAUTH2 # See Prometheus oauth2 follow redirects: # boolean, default = true enable http2: # boolean, default = true tls config: TLS CONFIG # See Prometheus tls config proxy url: STRING static configs: STATIC CONFIG # See Prometheus static config relabel configs: RELABEL CONFIG # See Prometheus relabel config metric relabel configs: METRIC RELABEL CONFIGS # See Prometheus metric relabel configs For examples of relabeling configs, see Additional receiver configuration .
- The following meta labels are available on targets for you to use in the relabel configs section: meta gce instance id : the numeric ID of the Compute Engine instance (local) meta gce instance name : the name of the Compute Engine instance (local); the Ops Agent automatically places this value in the mutable instance name label on your metrics. meta gce machine type : full or partial URL of the machine type of the instance; the Ops Agent automatically places this value in the mutable machine type label on your metrics. meta gce metadata NAME : each metadata item of the instance meta gce network : the network URL of the instance meta gce private ip : the private IP address of the instance meta gce interface ipv4 NAME : IPv4 address of each named interface meta gce project : the Google Cloud project in which the instance is running (local) meta gce public ip : the public IP address of the instance, if present meta gce tags : comma separated list of instance tags meta gce zone : the Compute Engine zone URL in which the instance is running The values of these labels are set when the Ops Agent starts.
- Add the staticLabel label with the value "A static value" to all ingested metrics. metrics: receivers: prometheus: type: prometheus config: scrape configs: - job name: 'json exporter' scrape interval: 10s metrics path: /probe params: module: [default] target: [http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json] static configs: - targets: ['localhost:7979'] relabel configs: - source labels: [ meta gce zone] regex: '(.+)' replacement: '${1}' target label: zone metric relabel configs: - source labels: [ name ] regex: 'example global value' action: drop - source labels: [ address ] action: replace replacement: 'A static value' target label: staticLabel Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
