Evidence snippets:
- Enter the following query and click Run query : severity>=DEBUG log id("GCEGuestAgentManager") "The agent config file is not valid" Linux Run the following command on the Linux Compute Engine VM: journalctl -u google-guest-agent-manager grep "The agent config file is not valid" Windows Run the following command on the Windows Compute Engine VM: Get-Eventlog -Source google guest agent manager -LogName Application Where-Object {$ .Message -like " The agent config file is not valid "} If you see logs containing the string The agent config file is not valid , then the custom configuration for the Ops Agent you provided when creating or updating the extension policy is invalid.
- Enable the APIs Grant roles required to use the Ops Agent To get the permissions that you need to use the Ops Agent to write logs and metrics, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your service account: To write logs: Logging Logs Writer ( roles/logging.logWriter ) To write metrics: Monitoring Metric Writer ( roles/monitoring.metricWriter ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- Verify that the Ops Agent is collecting telemetry If the Ops Agent has been successfully installed and is running correctly, then it sends metrics to Cloud Monitoring and logs to Cloud Logging.
- When the Ops Agent has been installed on the VM and is collecting logs and metrics, the agent's status is marked with a green checkmark next to the Ops Agent label.

Evidence snippets:
- This can be used to remove placeholder values, such as: httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : httpRequest.referer = "-" Sample Configurations The parse json processor would transform a JSON file containing { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } into a LogEntry structure that looks like this: { "jsonPayload" : { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } } This could then be transformed with modify fields into this LogEntry : { "httpRequest" : { "status" : 400 , "requestUrl" : "/index.html" , } } by using this Ops Agent configuration: logging : receivers : in : type : files include paths : - /var/log/http.json processors : parse json : type : parse json set http request : type : modify fields fields : httpRequest.status : move from : jsonPayload.http status type : integer httpRequest.requestUrl : move from : jsonPayload.path httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : jsonPayload.referer = "-" service : pipelines : pipeline : receivers : [ in ] processors : [ parse json , set http request ] This configuration reads JSON-formatted logs from /var/log/http.json and populates part of the httpRequest structure from fields in the logs.
- For more information about the metrics collected, see Metrics ingested by the receivers . logging : receivers : syslog : type : files include paths : - /var/log/messages - /var/log/syslog service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ syslog ] metrics : receivers : hostmetrics : type : hostmetrics collection interval : 60s processors : metrics filter : type : exclude metrics metrics pattern : [] service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ hostmetrics ] processors : [ metrics filter ] Windows By default, the Ops Agent collects Windows event logs from System , Application , and Security channels, as well as host metrics, IIS metrics, and SQL Server metrics.
- The valid types are: files : Collect logs by tailing files on disk. fluent forward (Ops Agent versions 2.12.0 and later): Collect logs sent via the Fluent Forward protocol over TCP. tcp (Ops Agent versions 2.3.0 and later): Collect logs in JSON format by listening to a TCP port.

Evidence snippets:
- This section describes the differences between the beta and GA agent policies For information about creating and managing agent policies, see the following: Use agent policies (GA) Use agent policies (beta) Differences between beta and GA agent policies The beta and GA agent policies differ in the following ways: Creation mechanisms Beta agent policies are created by using the following: The gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies command group in the Google Cloud SDK.
- What's next For information about using agent policies to manage the Ops Agent, see the following: Use agent policies (GA) Use agent policies (beta) Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- Delete the beta agent policy by running the following command: gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies delete POLICY ID --project PROJECT ID You might not be able to write a GA agent policy for the Ops Agent that is exactly the same as an existing beta agent policy.
- You can create a policy for a Google Cloud project that governs existing and new VMs associated with that Google Cloud project, ensuring proper installation and uninstallation of the Ops Agent on those VMs.
