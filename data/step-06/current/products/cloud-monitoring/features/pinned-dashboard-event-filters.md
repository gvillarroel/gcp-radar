### View application telemetry \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/application-monitoring](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/application-monitoring)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-2`
- Final score: 155
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- This is the project that you use to view your application's telemetry data: To get the permissions that you need to view log and metric data, and to create alerting policies and customize dashboards, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) on your App Hub host project or management project and any other projects listed in its default log scope.
- However, the flyout retains your current context and lets you save your exploration results to a custom dashboard: To open a flyout, click query stats Explore data .
- The Dashboards tab contains filters, which you can use to restrict what data the tab displays.
- Explore trace data Note: If your dashboards aren't displaying the trace data that you expect, then you might need to configure the default trace scope or you might need additional Identity and Access Management permissions.

### View and manage metric usage \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/metrics-management](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/metrics-management)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 135
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, to list active metrics that appear in no alerting policies and in no custom dashboards, add the following filters to the filter bar: Status: Active Alert Policies: (Empty) Custom Dashboards: (Empty) By default, when you add multiple filters, the table includes a row when the row meets all filters.
- Metrics used or not used in a custom dashboard in the current Google Cloud project.These filters don't include metrics that are used in predefined dashboards provided by Cloud Monitoring.
- Note: The Metrics Management page lists only alerting policies and custom dashboards defined in the current project; metrics listed with no alerting policies or custom dashboards might have alerting policies or custom dashboards in another project in your metrics scope.
- For each metric, the table displays that metric's contribution to billable volume and provides links to to the alerting policies and custom dashboards associated with the metric, as shown in the following screenshot.
