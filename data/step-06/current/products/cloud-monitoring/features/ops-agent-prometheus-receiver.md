Evidence snippets:
- The prometheus target resource has the following labels, which you can use for filtering and manipulating queried data: project id : The identifier of the Google Cloud project, like my-project , in which the Ops Agent is running. location : The Google Cloud region or zone in which the Ops Agent is running; for example, us-east1-a . cluster : Always gce for Prometheus metrics collected by using the Ops Agent. namespace : The Compute Engine instance ID of the VM on which the Ops Agent is running. job : The value of the job name field in the receiver configuration. instance : The instance label of the Prometheus target, taken from the receiver configuration; defaults to the target.
- For the JSON Exporter example, use the following procedure: Edit the Ops Agent configuration file, /etc/google-cloud-ops-agent/config.yaml , and add the following Prometheus receiver and pipeline entries: metrics: receivers: prometheus: type: prometheus config: scrape configs: - job name: 'json exporter' scrape interval: 10s metrics path: /probe params: module: [default] target: [http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json] static configs: - targets: ['localhost:7979'] service: pipelines: prometheus pipeline: receivers: - prometheus If you have other configuration entries in this file already, add the Prometheus receiver and pipeline to the existing metrics and service entries.
- You can use the following pattern to add labels staticLabel1 and staticLabel2 to all ingested metrics: metric relabel configs: - source labels: [ address ] action: replace replacement: ' STATIC VALUE 1 ' target label: staticLabel1 - source labels: [ address ] action: replace replacement: ' STATIC VALUE 2 ' target label: staticLabel2 The following version of the Prometheus receiver for the JSON Exporter example uses these configuration patterns to do the following: Set the zone label from the value of the meta gce zone meta label provided by the Ops Agent.
- To restart the agent, run the following PowerShell command: Restart-Service google-cloud-ops-agent -Force To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started: Get-Service google-cloud-ops-agent Prometheus metrics in Cloud Monitoring You can use the tools provided by Cloud Monitoring with the data collected by the Prometheus receiver.

Evidence snippets:
- Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges by right-clicking the PowerShell icon and selecting Run as Administrator To restart the agent, run the following PowerShell command: Restart-Service google-cloud-ops-agent -Force To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started: Get-Service google-cloud-ops-agent Collect OTLP metrics When you use the OTLP receiver to collect metrics from your OpenTelemetry applications, the primary configuration choice for the receiver is the API that you want to use to ingest the metrics.
- Disable the OTLP receiver If you are collecting both OTLP metrics and traces by using the Ops Agent, and you want to disable the collection of either metrics or traces but not both, then do the following: Disable collection of either metrics or traces by making one of the following changes to the user configuration file, config.yaml : Remove the otlp pipeline from the metrics service.
- The prometheus target resource type also includes these labels: project id : The identifier of the Google Cloud project, like my-project , in which the Ops Agent is running. cluster : The value is always gce when metrics are collected by the Ops Agent.
- This document describes how can use the Ops Agent and the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) receiver to collect user-defined metrics and traces from applications instrumented by using OpenTelemetry and running on Compute Engine.

- For more information about the metrics collected, see Metrics ingested by the receivers . logging : receivers : syslog : type : files include paths : - /var/log/messages - /var/log/syslog service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ syslog ] metrics : receivers : hostmetrics : type : hostmetrics collection interval : 60s processors : metrics filter : type : exclude metrics metrics pattern : [] service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ hostmetrics ] processors : [ metrics filter ] Windows By default, the Ops Agent collects Windows event logs from System , Application , and Security channels, as well as host metrics, IIS metrics, and SQL Server metrics.
- The entire metrics configuration looks like the following: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [] The following example shows the built-in service configuration for Windows: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : - hostmetrics - iis - mssql processors : - metrics filter The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics submodule to be debug instead: metrics : service : log level : debug Collection of self logs By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
- Example logging service configurations A service configuration has the following structure: service: log level: CUSTOM LOG LEVEL pipelines: PIPELINE ID : receivers: [...] processors: [...] PIPELINE ID 2 : receivers: [...] processors: [...] To stop the agent from collecting and sending either /var/log/message or /var/log/syslog entries, redefine the default pipeline with an empty receivers list and no processors.
