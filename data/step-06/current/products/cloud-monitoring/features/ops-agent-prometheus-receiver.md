### Collect Prometheus metrics \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`

Evidence snippets:
- Some of the meta labels are relabelled for you by the default Ops Agent configuration. relabel configs: - source labels: [ meta gce zone] regex: '(.+)' replacement: '${1}' target label: zone The Prometheus receiver shown in Example: Configure the Ops Agent for Prometheus includes the addition of this label.
- The prometheus target resource has the following labels, which you can use for filtering and manipulating queried data: project id : The identifier of the Google Cloud project, like my-project , in which the Ops Agent is running. location : The Google Cloud region or zone in which the Ops Agent is running; for example, us-east1-a . cluster : Always gce for Prometheus metrics collected by using the Ops Agent. namespace : The Compute Engine instance ID of the VM on which the Ops Agent is running. job : The value of the job name field in the receiver configuration. instance : The instance label of the Prometheus target, taken from the receiver configuration; defaults to the target.
- For the JSON Exporter example, use the following procedure: Edit the Ops Agent configuration file, /etc/google-cloud-ops-agent/config.yaml , and add the following Prometheus receiver and pipeline entries: metrics: receivers: prometheus: type: prometheus config: scrape configs: - job name: 'json exporter' scrape interval: 10s metrics path: /probe params: module: [default] target: [http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json] static configs: - targets: ['localhost:7979'] service: pipelines: prometheus pipeline: receivers: - prometheus If you have other configuration entries in this file already, add the Prometheus receiver and pipeline to the existing metrics and service entries.
- You can use the following pattern to add labels staticLabel1 and staticLabel2 to all ingested metrics: metric relabel configs: - source labels: [ address ] action: replace replacement: ' STATIC VALUE 1 ' target label: staticLabel1 - source labels: [ address ] action: replace replacement: ' STATIC VALUE 2 ' target label: staticLabel2 The following version of the Prometheus receiver for the JSON Exporter example uses these configuration patterns to do the following: Set the zone label from the value of the meta gce zone meta label provided by the Ops Agent.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The beta and GA policies are also structurally different: Policies created by using gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies describe agent policies by passing individual options to the commands, for example: gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create ops-agents-test-policy \ --agent-rules = "type=logging,enable-autoupgrade=false;type=metrics,enable-autoupgrade=false" \ --description = "A test policy." \ --os-types = short-name = centos,version = 7 \ --instances = zones/us-central1-a/instances/test-instance \ --project PROJECT ID The agent-policy Terraform module provides the same capabilities.
- This section describes the differences between the beta and GA agent policies For information about creating and managing agent policies, see the following: Use agent policies (GA) Use agent policies (beta) Differences between beta and GA agent policies The beta and GA agent policies differ in the following ways: Creation mechanisms Beta agent policies are created by using the following: The gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies command group in the Google Cloud SDK.
- Pollicies created by using the gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies describe agent policy by using a YAML configuration file and a zone, for example: gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies create test-policy \ --zone us-central1-a \ --file test-policy.yaml \ --project PROJECT ID The ops-agent-policy Terraform module provides the same capabilities.

Evidence snippets:
- This can be used to remove placeholder values, such as: httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : httpRequest.referer = "-" Sample Configurations The parse json processor would transform a JSON file containing { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } into a LogEntry structure that looks like this: { "jsonPayload" : { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } } This could then be transformed with modify fields into this LogEntry : { "httpRequest" : { "status" : 400 , "requestUrl" : "/index.html" , } } by using this Ops Agent configuration: logging : receivers : in : type : files include paths : - /var/log/http.json processors : parse json : type : parse json set http request : type : modify fields fields : httpRequest.status : move from : jsonPayload.http status type : integer httpRequest.requestUrl : move from : jsonPayload.path httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : jsonPayload.referer = "-" service : pipelines : pipeline : receivers : [ in ] processors : [ parse json , set http request ] This configuration reads JSON-formatted logs from /var/log/http.json and populates part of the httpRequest structure from fields in the logs.
- For more information about the metrics collected, see Metrics ingested by the receivers . logging : receivers : syslog : type : files include paths : - /var/log/messages - /var/log/syslog service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ syslog ] metrics : receivers : hostmetrics : type : hostmetrics collection interval : 60s processors : metrics filter : type : exclude metrics metrics pattern : [] service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ hostmetrics ] processors : [ metrics filter ] Windows By default, the Ops Agent collects Windows event logs from System , Application , and Security channels, as well as host metrics, IIS metrics, and SQL Server metrics.
- The entire metrics configuration looks like the following: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [] The following example shows the built-in service configuration for Windows: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : - hostmetrics - iis - mssql processors : - metrics filter The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics submodule to be debug instead: metrics : service : log level : debug Collection of self logs By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
- Metrics service The metrics service customizes verbosity for the Ops Agent metrics module's own logs and links metrics receivers and processors together into pipelines.
