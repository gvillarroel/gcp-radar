Evidence snippets:
- Verify the installation of the Ops Agent This section describes how to do the following: Verify the status or version of an Ops Agent installation Verify that the Ops Agent is collecting telemetry Verify the status or version of an Ops Agent installation To determine the status or version of the Ops Agent, use one of the following Google Cloud console pages: Compute Engine In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page: Go to VM instances If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Compute Engine .
- Enter the following query and click Run query : severity>=DEBUG log id("GCEGuestAgentManager") "The agent config file is not valid" Linux Run the following command on the Linux Compute Engine VM: journalctl -u google-guest-agent-manager grep "The agent config file is not valid" Windows Run the following command on the Windows Compute Engine VM: Get-Eventlog -Source google guest agent manager -LogName Application Where-Object {$ .Message -like " The agent config file is not valid "} If you see logs containing the string The agent config file is not valid , then the custom configuration for the Ops Agent you provided when creating or updating the extension policy is invalid.
- To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the Required permissions section: Required permissions The following permissions are required to create, view, modify, and delete VM extension policies: To create extension policies: compute.vmExtensionPolicies.create To view extension policies: compute.vmExtensionPolicies.list To view details of an extension policy: compute.vmExtensionPolicies.get To modify extension policies: compute.vmExtensionPolicies.update To delete extension policies: compute.vmExtensionPolicies.delete You might also be able to get these permissions with custom roles or other predefined roles .
- Troubleshoot extension policies This section provides information about troubleshooting the use of extension policies to manage the Ops Agent: gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies commands fail The extension policy is created, but the Ops Agent status is "not detected" Linux systemctl and Windows Service Manager don't work with the Ops Agent For information about troubleshooting the Ops Agent, see Troubleshoot the Ops Agent . gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies commands fail When a gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies command fails, the response includes troubleshooting suggestions.

- Compute Engine VM instances generally have the correct credentials by default.
- This sets the HTTP PROXY and HTTPS PROXY environment variables so that the agent can send data using outbound HTTPS: setx HTTP PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx HTTPS PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx no proxy "metadata.google.internal,169.254.169.254" /m Determine the agent version To determine the version of the Ops Agent on your system, run the following commands on your VM instance: Google Cloud console To see the version of your Ops Agent on a VM: Locate the entry for the VM in the Instances table in the Monitoring VM Instances page.
- The List view on the Inventory tab on the dashboard lists all VMs and includes a status column for your agent, as shown in the following screenshot: The Agent column reports the following values: Not detected : Either you don't have an agent installed or it is not running.
