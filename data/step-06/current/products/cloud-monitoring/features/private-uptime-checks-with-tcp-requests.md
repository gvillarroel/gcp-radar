- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 74
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Verify that the Ops Agent is running To verify that the Ops Agent is running, you can use either of the following: VM Instances dashboard : This dashboard lets you view the agent installation status across your VM fleet.
- If this status persists for longer than 10 minutes, it might indicate a problem with the ingestion of the telemetry.
- If this status persists for longer than 10 minutes, it might indicate a problem with the ingestion of the telemetry.
- In addition, this agent uses new configuration files that are not compatible with the old agents.
