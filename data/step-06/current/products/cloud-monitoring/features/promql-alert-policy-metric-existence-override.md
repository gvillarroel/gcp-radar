- If this field is not empty, each listed field in the existing alerting policy is set to the value of the corresponding field in the supplied policy ( alert policy ), or to the field's default value if the field is not in the supplied alerting policy.
- The alerting policy that is returned will have a name that contains a normalized representation of this name as a prefix but adds a suffix of the form /alertPolicies/[ALERT POLICY ID] , identifying the policy in the container.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 155
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Create alerts based on metric ingestion To be notified of a spike, dip, or trend in the metric collection rates for your billable metrics, create an alerting policy.
- To create an alerting policy that monitors a metric collection rate, do the following: In the Google Cloud console, go to the query stats Metrics management page: Go to Metrics management If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Monitoring .
- You can list metrics that appear in no alerting policy or in no custom dashboard defined in the current Google Cloud project by selecting the No alert policies or No custom dashboards quick filter.
- If you have metrics that aren't used in an alerting policy or a custom dashboard and are never queried, then you might be paying for metrics and not be getting any observability benefit from them.
