### View and manage metric usage \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 158
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- You can modify the chart configuration, discard it, or you can add it to a custom dashboard.
- This chart can tell you which projects are sending the most data, and if any project is sending an increasing or decreasing amount of data. ( Billable samples only ) To find the namespaces that are sending metrics with the largest contributions to the billable values, use the Namespace Volume Ingestion chart.
- You can use the Metrics Management page to do the following: View metric usage at a glance : See how your metrics are being used in queries , custom dashboards , or alerting policies .
- You can only select one quick filter at a time, so you can't list only active metrics that appear in neither an alerting policy or a custom dashboard by using quick filters.

### Collect Prometheus metrics \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 150
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For information about dashboards and the types of charts you can use, see Dashboards and charts .
- The prometheus target resource has the following labels, which you can use for filtering and manipulating queried data: project id : The identifier of the Google Cloud project, like my-project , in which the Ops Agent is running. location : The Google Cloud region or zone in which the Ops Agent is running; for example, us-east1-a . cluster : Always gce for Prometheus metrics collected by using the Ops Agent. namespace : The Compute Engine instance ID of the VM on which the Ops Agent is running. job : The value of the job name field in the receiver configuration. instance : The instance label of the Prometheus target, taken from the receiver configuration; defaults to the target.
- For the JSON Exporter example, use the following procedure: Edit the Ops Agent configuration file, /etc/google-cloud-ops-agent/config.yaml , and add the following Prometheus receiver and pipeline entries: metrics: receivers: prometheus: type: prometheus config: scrape configs: - job name: 'json exporter' scrape interval: 10s metrics path: /probe params: module: [default] target: [http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json] static configs: - targets: ['localhost:7979'] service: pipelines: prometheus pipeline: receivers: - prometheus If you have other configuration entries in this file already, add the Prometheus receiver and pipeline to the existing metrics and service entries.
- You can use the following pattern to add labels staticLabel1 and staticLabel2 to all ingested metrics: metric relabel configs: - source labels: [ address ] action: replace replacement: ' STATIC VALUE 1 ' target label: staticLabel1 - source labels: [ address ] action: replace replacement: ' STATIC VALUE 2 ' target label: staticLabel2 The following version of the Prometheus receiver for the JSON Exporter example uses these configuration patterns to do the following: Set the zone label from the value of the meta gce zone meta label provided by the Ops Agent.
