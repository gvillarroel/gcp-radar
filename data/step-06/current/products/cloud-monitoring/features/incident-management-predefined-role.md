- For example: export PROJECT ID = "my-test-project" export EMAIL ADDRESS = "myuser@gmail.com" gcloud projects add - iam - policy - binding \ $ PROJECT ID \ -- member = "user:$EMAIL ADDRESS" \ -- role = "roles/monitoring.editor" You can confirm the granted roles using the gcloud projects get-iam-policy command: export PROJECT ID = "my-test-project" gcloud projects get - iam - policy $ PROJECT ID Predefined roles This section lists a subset of IAM roles that are predefined by Cloud Monitoring.
- Incident roles The following roles grant permissions only for incidents: Name Title Description roles/monitoring.cloudConsoleIncidentViewer Monitoring Cloud Console Incident Viewer Grants access to view incidents by using the Google Cloud console. roles/monitoring.cloudConsoleIncidentEditor Monitoring Cloud Console Incident Editor Grants access to view, acknowledge, and close incidents by using the Google Cloud console.
- Permissions aren't granted directly to users; permissions are instead granted indirectly through roles, which group multiple permissions to make managing them easier: For information about access control, see Concepts related to access management .

Evidence snippets:
- Authorization To get the permissions that you need to view dashboards and create alerting policies by using the Google Cloud console or to create, edit, and delete metric-exclusion rules, ask your administrator to grant you the Monitoring Editor ( roles/monitoring.editor ) IAM role on your project.
- To get the permissions that you need to view audit logs, ask your administrator to grant you the Private Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.privateLogViewer ) IAM role on your project.
- View summaries of metric usage To view summaries of the number of billable metrics, rates of metric ingestion, and error rate, do the following: In the Google Cloud console, go to the query stats Metrics management page: Go to Metrics management If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Monitoring .
- View the volume of excluded metrics To see the volume of excluded bytes or samples as a chart in Metrics Explorer, do the following: In the Google Cloud console, go to the query stats Metrics management page: Go to Metrics management If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Monitoring .
