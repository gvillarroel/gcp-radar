### Monitoring agent overview \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/monitoring](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/monitoring)
- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 116
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Monitoring APIs: monitoring.googleapis.com Installing the agent requires access to the following DNS names: (Linux) Google Cloud package repository: packages.cloud.google.com (Linux) Google downloads subdomain: dl.google.com (Windows) Legacy Stackdriver download server: repo.stackdriver.com Getting the Monitoring agent source code The source code for the Monitoring agent is available for only the Linux-hosted Monitoring agent.
- Linux operating systems The Monitoring agent supports the following Linux operating systems: Rocky Linux 8 RHEL 8: rhel-8-6-sap-ha, rhel-8-8-sap-ha SLES 12: sles-12-sp5-sap SLES 15: sles-15-sp5, sles-15-sp3-sap, sles-15-sp4-sap, sles-15-sp5-sap The Monitoring agent does not presently support the Container-Optimized OS that is the default in Google Kubernetes Engine clusters.
- Google Kubernetes Engine node instances: GKE on Google Cloud clusters are configured to collect logs and metrics with Logging and Monitoring by default.
- However, if you have to run the legacy Logging agent on Windows and also need to collect metrics, you must use the legacy Monitoring agent; you can't run the Ops Agent and a legacy agent on the same machine.

### "Installing the Cloud Monitoring agent on individual VMs \_|\_ Google Cloud\

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- This sets the HTTP PROXY and HTTPS PROXY environment variables so that the agent can send data using outbound HTTPS: setx HTTP PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx HTTPS PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx no proxy 169.254.169.254 /m Determine the agent version To determine the version of the Monitoring agent on your system, run the following commands on your VM instance: DEBIAN / UBUNTU Run the following command on Debian or Ubuntu: dpkg-query --show --showformat ' ${ Package } ${ Version } ${ Architecture } ${ Status } \n' stackdriver-agent SLES / SUSE Run the following command on SUSE: rpm --query --queryformat '%{NAME} %{VERSION} %{RELEASE} %{ARCH}\n' stackdriver-agent WINDOWS There is presently no way to determine the version of the Monitoring agent running on Windows.
- Configure an HTTP proxy If you use an HTTP proxy for proxying requests to the Logging and Monitoring APIs, do the following: Linux Edit the following configuration file (create the file if it doesn't already exist): For agent versions 6.0.0 and higher, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-agent For agent versions earlier than 6.0.0, edit the appropriate file for your OS: For Debian and Ubuntu, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-agent For CentOS and SLES, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-collectd Note: If this file doesn't exist, create it.
- Run the following PowerShell commands: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://repo.stackdriver.com/windows/StackdriverMonitoring-GCM-46.exe", "${env:UserProfile}\StackdriverMonitoring-GCM-46.exe") & "${env:UserProfile}\StackdriverMonitoring-GCM-46.exe" Alternatively, you can browse to the following URL to download and run the agent's installer: https://repo.stackdriver.com/windows/StackdriverMonitoring-GCM-46.exe Caution: You must download the installer to a non-system directory, such as C:\Users\[USERNAME] .
- Run the following PowerShell command: Restart-Service -Name StackdriverMonitoring Upgrade the agent To upgrade the Monitoring agent to the latest release, use the following instructions: Note: If you upgraded your instance's Linux operating system to a new major release, then you should first remove the agent and then re-install it using the procedures on this page, instead of completing these upgrade procedures.

- You can install the Ops Agent on one or more Compute Engine VMs by using the Google Cloud console from the Cloud Monitoring or Compute Engine pages.
- The Ops Agent collects logs and metrics on Compute Engine instances, sending your logs to Cloud Logging and your metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
