Evidence snippets:
- The following screenshot illustrates the dashboard for a workload: The registration status of a service or workload affects what data Application Monitoring displays on the dashboard for the service or workload: Registered : Application Monitoring uses the application-specific labels and attributes that supported infrastructure and instrumented applications attach to the telemetry they generate.
- Trace spans that instrumented applications generate.
- List applications To list the applications you have registered with App Hub, along with information like the number of incidents and the application's location, criticality, and environment, do the following: In the Google Cloud console, go to the Application monitoring page: Go to Application monitoring If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Monitoring .
- To determine what trace data to analyze, Google Cloud Observability queries the resources listed in the default trace scope for trace data, and then retains only the data that is for projects within your application management boundary.

### "Collect OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) metrics and traces \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring\

Evidence snippets:
- This document describes how can use the Ops Agent and the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) receiver to collect user-defined metrics and traces from applications instrumented by using OpenTelemetry and running on Compute Engine.
- Trivial PromQL queries for the example metrics look like the following: workload googleapis com:otlp test gauge{monitored resource="gce instance"} workload googleapis com:otlp test cumulative{monitored resource="gce instance"} The following screenshot shows the result of querying the workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.gauge metric: The following screenshot shows the result of querying the workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative metric: View metric usage and diagnostics in Cloud Monitoring The Cloud Monitoring Metrics Management page provides information that can help you control the amount you spend on billable metrics without affecting observability.
- Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges by right-clicking the PowerShell icon and selecting Run as Administrator To restart the agent, run the following PowerShell command: Restart-Service google-cloud-ops-agent -Force To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started: Get-Service google-cloud-ops-agent Collect OTLP metrics When you use the OTLP receiver to collect metrics from your OpenTelemetry applications, the primary configuration choice for the receiver is the API that you want to use to ingest the metrics.
- Benefits Before the availability of the OTLP plugin for the Ops Agent, the primary ways to instrument your applications to collect user-defined metrics and traces included the following: Using client libraries that implement the Monitoring API or the Trace API.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Only configure scopes To get the permissions that you need to configure the observability scope, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: Observability Editor ( roles/observability.editor ) on your App Hub host project or management project Logs Configuration Writer ( roles/logging.configWriter ) on your App Hub host project or management project Monitoring admin ( roles/monitoring.admin ) on your App Hub host project or management project and on each project that you want to add to the metrics scope Cloud Trace User ( roles/cloudtrace.user ) on your App Hub host project or management project App Hub viewer ( roles/apphub.viewer ) on your App Hub host project or management project For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- Configure and set the default trace scope Do the following: For each project that will store your application's trace data, we recommend that you enable the Observability API: Roles required to enable APIs To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ), which contains the serviceusage.services.enable permission.
- Configure the metrics scope Make sure that the metrics scope for your App Hub host project or management project lists all projects that store your application's metric data: For app-enabled folders, Google Cloud Observability attempts to synchronize the list of projects in your app-enabled folder with the list of projects in the metrics scope.
- When the number of projects in your app-enabled folder doesn't exceed your metrics scope quota, which defaults to 375 projects per metrics scope, then Google Cloud Observability can keep the list of projects in the metrics scope synchronized with the list of projects in your app-enabled folder.
