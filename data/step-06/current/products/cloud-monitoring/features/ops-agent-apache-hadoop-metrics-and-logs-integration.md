- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 179
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- You can install the Ops Agent on Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters that use image version 2.2 and later to collect syslog logs and host metrics.
- Metrics collected include: cpu metrics disk metrics iis metrics (Windows only) interface metrics gpu metrics (Linux only) memory metrics mssql metrics (Windows only) pagefile metrics (Windows only) swap metrics network metrics processes metrics agent self metrics : Third-party application support Curated integrations for third-party application metrics , which collect common app metrics and offer sample dashboards and alert policies.
- Combining the collection of logs, metrics, and traces into a single process, the Ops Agent uses Fluent Bit for logs, which supports high-throughput logging, and the OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics and traces.
- Pricing If you install the Ops Agent, then you might be charged for the metrics, logs, or traces that the agent sends to your Google Cloud project.

Evidence snippets:
- If the integration collects logs, then the Logs tab shows the structure of the logs collected by each Ops Agent log receiver and provides a link to view those logs in the Logs Explorer.
- The following screenshot shows an example of a Logs tab: Configure third-party integrations If you open the details pane for a third-party integration you haven't installed, then the panel indicates that you have no dashboards or configured resources for the integration.
- The following screenshot shows an example of the Monitoring Integrations page: The Integrations page displays the following: A listing of how many Compute Engine VMs have the Ops Agent installed and how many GKE clusters have Managed Service for Prometheus enabled.
- To limit the list of integrations by the type of application, click one of the following options: 3rd party services : shows all third-party services that have integrations with the Ops Agent or Managed Service for Prometheus.
