Evidence snippets:
- Metrics collected include: cpu metrics disk metrics iis metrics (Windows only) interface metrics gpu metrics (Linux only) memory metrics mssql metrics (Windows only) pagefile metrics (Windows only) swap metrics network metrics processes metrics agent self metrics : Third-party application support Curated integrations for third-party application metrics , which collect common app metrics and offer sample dashboards and alert policies.
- Combining the collection of logs, metrics, and traces into a single process, the Ops Agent uses Fluent Bit for logs, which supports high-throughput logging, and the OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics and traces.
- You can install the Ops Agent on Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters that use image version 2.2 and later to collect syslog logs and host metrics.
- To collect OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) traces, you must configure the agent to collect traces from an instrumented application; for more information, see Collect (OTLP) traces with the Ops Agent .

- The entire metrics configuration looks like the following: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [] The following example shows the built-in service configuration for Windows: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : - hostmetrics - iis - mssql processors : - metrics filter The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics submodule to be debug instead: metrics : service : log level : debug Collection of self logs By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
- The valid types are: files : Collect logs by tailing files on disk. fluent forward (Ops Agent versions 2.12.0 and later): Collect logs sent via the Fluent Forward protocol over TCP. tcp (Ops Agent versions 2.3.0 and later): Collect logs in JSON format by listening to a TCP port.

Evidence snippets:
- Metrics from third-party monitoring applications Cloud Monitoring provides integrations that let you collect telemetry from applications such as Apache Web Server, MySQL, Redis, and others for deployments running on Compute Engine and Google Kubernetes Engine: When using Compute Engine, third-party telemetry is collected by the Ops Agent .
- For your agentic applications, some frameworks can collect your prompts and responses or pass context that allows tracing of some remote Google Cloud MCP servers calls.
- To collect additional system metrics from your Compute Engine instances, install an agent.
