Evidence snippets:
- The prometheus target resource has the following labels, which you can use for filtering and manipulating queried data: project id : The identifier of the Google Cloud project, like my-project , in which the Ops Agent is running. location : The Google Cloud region or zone in which the Ops Agent is running; for example, us-east1-a . cluster : Always gce for Prometheus metrics collected by using the Ops Agent. namespace : The Compute Engine instance ID of the VM on which the Ops Agent is running. job : The value of the job name field in the receiver configuration. instance : The instance label of the Prometheus target, taken from the receiver configuration; defaults to the target.
- To restart the agent, run the following PowerShell command: Restart-Service google-cloud-ops-agent -Force To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started: Get-Service google-cloud-ops-agent Prometheus metrics in Cloud Monitoring You can use the tools provided by Cloud Monitoring with the data collected by the Prometheus receiver.
- When Prometheus metrics are emitted by an application, directly or by using a library or exporter, the metrics can then be collected by an Ops Agent configured with a Prometheus receiver.
- This document describes the configuration and use of an Ops Agent metrics receiver that you can use to collect metrics from Prometheus on Compute Engine.

Evidence snippets:
- To disable self-log collection, add a global section to your user-specified configuration file and set the default self log file collection option to the value false : logging: ... metrics: ... global: default self log file collection: false Log-rotation configuration Starting with Ops Agent version 2.31.0, you can also set up the agent's log-rotation feature by using the configuration files.
- For more information about the metrics collected, see Metrics ingested by the receivers . logging : receivers : syslog : type : files include paths : - /var/log/messages - /var/log/syslog service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ syslog ] metrics : receivers : hostmetrics : type : hostmetrics collection interval : 60s processors : metrics filter : type : exclude metrics metrics pattern : [] service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ hostmetrics ] processors : [ metrics filter ] Windows By default, the Ops Agent collects Windows event logs from System , Application , and Security channels, as well as host metrics, IIS metrics, and SQL Server metrics.
- The entire metrics configuration looks like the following: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [] The following example shows the built-in service configuration for Windows: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : - hostmetrics - iis - mssql processors : - metrics filter The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics submodule to be debug instead: metrics : service : log level : debug Collection of self logs By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
- This processor supplies an empty metrics pattern value, so it doesn't exclude any metrics. processors : metrics filter : type : exclude metrics metrics pattern : [] To disable the collection of all process metrics by the Ops Agent, add the following to your config.yaml file: metrics: processors: metrics filter: type: exclude metrics metrics pattern: - agent.googleapis.com/processes/ This excludes process metrics from collection in the metrics filter processor that applies to the default pipeline in the metrics service.

### "Install and manage the Ops Agent by using VM Extension Manager policies\

- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 212
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Verify that the Ops Agent is collecting telemetry If the Ops Agent has been successfully installed and is running correctly, then it sends metrics to Cloud Monitoring and logs to Cloud Logging.
- When the Ops Agent has been installed on the VM and is collecting logs and metrics, the agent's status is marked with a green checkmark next to the Ops Agent label.
- Running the Ops Agent and the legacy agents on the same VM can cause ingestion of duplicate logs or conflicts in metrics ingestion.
- Verify the installation of the Ops Agent This section describes how to do the following: Verify the status or version of an Ops Agent installation Verify that the Ops Agent is collecting telemetry Verify the status or version of an Ops Agent installation To determine the status or version of the Ops Agent, use one of the following Google Cloud console pages: Compute Engine In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page: Go to VM instances If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Compute Engine .
