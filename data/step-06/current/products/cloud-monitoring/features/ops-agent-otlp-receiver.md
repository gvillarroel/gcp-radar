Evidence snippets:
- Open a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges by right-clicking the PowerShell icon and selecting Run as Administrator To restart the agent, run the following PowerShell command: Restart-Service google-cloud-ops-agent -Force To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started: Get-Service google-cloud-ops-agent Collect OTLP metrics When you use the OTLP receiver to collect metrics from your OpenTelemetry applications, the primary configuration choice for the receiver is the API that you want to use to ingest the metrics.
- To disable the collection of OTLP metrics and traces by the Ops Agent, do the following: Remove the OTLP configuration from the user configuration file: Delete the entire combined section, which includes the otlp receiver.
- Overview of using the OTLP receiver With the Ops Agent OTLP receiver, you can do the following: Instrument your application by using one of the language-specific SDKs for OpenTelemetry.
- You can collect logs by using the Ops Agent and other receivers and you can include log information in OTLP spans, but the OTLP receiver doesn't support the direct collection of logs.

Evidence snippets:
- Troubleshoot extension policies This section provides information about troubleshooting the use of extension policies to manage the Ops Agent: gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies commands fail The extension policy is created, but the Ops Agent status is "not detected" Linux systemctl and Windows Service Manager don't work with the Ops Agent For information about troubleshooting the Ops Agent, see Troubleshoot the Ops Agent . gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies commands fail When a gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies command fails, the response includes troubleshooting suggestions.
- For example, suppose you created and rolled out a global policy by using the following command: gcloud beta compute global-vm-extension-policies create POLICY NAME \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --extensions=ops-agent \ --version=ops-agent=2.61.0 \ --rollout-predefined-plan=slow rollout \ --config-from-file=ops-agent="/usr/ops-agent-config.yaml" To extend the policy to VMs created in previously unused zones, restart the rollout by using the following command: gcloud beta compute global-vm-extension-policies update test-policy POLICY NAME \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --extensions=ops-agent \ --version=ops-agent=2.61.0 \ --rollout-predefined-plan=slow rollout \ --config-from-file=ops-agent="/usr/ops-agent-config.yaml" \ --rollout-retry-uuid= UUID Replace the following variables in the command: POLICY NAME : A name for the VM extension policy.
- Enter the following query and click Run query : severity>=DEBUG log id("GCEGuestAgentManager") "The agent config file is not valid" Linux Run the following command on the Linux Compute Engine VM: journalctl -u google-guest-agent-manager grep "The agent config file is not valid" Windows Run the following command on the Windows Compute Engine VM: Get-Eventlog -Source google guest agent manager -LogName Application Where-Object {$ .Message -like " The agent config file is not valid "} If you see logs containing the string The agent config file is not valid , then the custom configuration for the Ops Agent you provided when creating or updating the extension policy is invalid.
- If you haven't done so already, install the beta component of the gcloud CLI by running the following command: gcloud components install beta To check if you have the beta component installed, run the following command: gcloud components list If you previously installed the beta component, verify that have the latest version: gcloud components update Uninstall any observability agents Before creating a VM Extension Manager policy to manage the Ops Agent on a VM, ensure that there are no instances of the Ops Agent or the legacy Monitoring agent and Logging agent already on the VM.

Evidence snippets:
- The beta and GA policies are also structurally different: Policies created by using gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies describe agent policies by passing individual options to the commands, for example: gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create ops-agents-test-policy \ --agent-rules = "type=logging,enable-autoupgrade=false;type=metrics,enable-autoupgrade=false" \ --description = "A test policy." \ --os-types = short-name = centos,version = 7 \ --instances = zones/us-central1-a/instances/test-instance \ --project PROJECT ID The agent-policy Terraform module provides the same capabilities.
- This section describes the differences between the beta and GA agent policies For information about creating and managing agent policies, see the following: Use agent policies (GA) Use agent policies (beta) Differences between beta and GA agent policies The beta and GA agent policies differ in the following ways: Creation mechanisms Beta agent policies are created by using the following: The gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies command group in the Google Cloud SDK.
- Pollicies created by using the gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies describe agent policy by using a YAML configuration file and a zone, for example: gcloud compute instances ops-agents policies create test-policy \ --zone us-central1-a \ --file test-policy.yaml \ --project PROJECT ID The ops-agent-policy Terraform module provides the same capabilities.
