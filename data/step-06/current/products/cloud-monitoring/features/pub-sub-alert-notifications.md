Evidence snippets:
- In addition to using this API, alert policies can also be managed through Cloud Monitoring <https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/> , which can be reached by clicking the "Monitoring" tab in Cloud console <https://console.cloud.google.com/> .
- The alerting policy that is returned will have a name that contains a normalized representation of this name as a prefix but adds a suffix of the form /alertPolicies/[ALERT POLICY ID] , identifying the policy in the container.
- You can either replace the entire policy with a new one or replace only certain fields in the current alerting policy by specifying the fields to be updated via updateMask .
