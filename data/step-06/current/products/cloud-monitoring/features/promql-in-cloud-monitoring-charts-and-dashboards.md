Evidence snippets:
- The following tabs show the metric descriptor that each ingestion API creates: Prometheus API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "labels": [ { "key": "instance name" }, { "key": "machine type" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "prometheus target" ] } Monitoring API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "labels": [ { "key": "instrumentation source" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "gce instance", ...many other types deleted... ] } The following table summarizes some of the format differences imposed by the APIs used to ingest OTLP metrics: Prometheus API Monitoring API Metric domain prometheus.googleapis.com workload.googleapis.com OTLP metric name Modified during ingestion Used as provided Monitored resource prometheus target gce instance Ingestion formats and queries The metrics mode used in the OTLP receiver affects the way you query the resulting metrics in Cloud Monitoring when you build charts, dashboards, and alerting policies.
- After the Ops Agent has collected your metrics, you can use the features of Cloud Monitoring, including charts, dashboards, and alerting policies, to monitor your metrics.
- You can create charts, dashboards, and alerting policies in Monitoring for metrics of either metric format, but you refer to the metrics differently in queries.
- The metrics mode choice doesn't affect your ability to create charts, dashboards, and alerting policies in Monitoring.

### "Installing the Cloud Monitoring agent on individual VMs \_|\_ Google Cloud\

Evidence snippets:
- This sets the HTTP PROXY and HTTPS PROXY environment variables so that the agent can send data using outbound HTTPS: setx HTTP PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx HTTPS PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx no proxy 169.254.169.254 /m Determine the agent version To determine the version of the Monitoring agent on your system, run the following commands on your VM instance: DEBIAN / UBUNTU Run the following command on Debian or Ubuntu: dpkg-query --show --showformat ' ${ Package } ${ Version } ${ Architecture } ${ Status } \n' stackdriver-agent SLES / SUSE Run the following command on SUSE: rpm --query --queryformat '%{NAME} %{VERSION} %{RELEASE} %{ARCH}\n' stackdriver-agent WINDOWS There is presently no way to determine the version of the Monitoring agent running on Windows.
- Configure an HTTP proxy If you use an HTTP proxy for proxying requests to the Logging and Monitoring APIs, do the following: Linux Edit the following configuration file (create the file if it doesn't already exist): For agent versions 6.0.0 and higher, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-agent For agent versions earlier than 6.0.0, edit the appropriate file for your OS: For Debian and Ubuntu, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-agent For CentOS and SLES, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-collectd Note: If this file doesn't exist, create it.
- Run the following PowerShell commands: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://repo.stackdriver.com/windows/StackdriverMonitoring-GCM-46.exe", "${env:UserProfile}\StackdriverMonitoring-GCM-46.exe") & "${env:UserProfile}\StackdriverMonitoring-GCM-46.exe" Alternatively, you can browse to the following URL to download and run the agent's installer: https://repo.stackdriver.com/windows/StackdriverMonitoring-GCM-46.exe Caution: You must download the installer to a non-system directory, such as C:\Users\[USERNAME] .
- Run the following PowerShell command: Restart-Service -Name StackdriverMonitoring Upgrade the agent To upgrade the Monitoring agent to the latest release, use the following instructions: Note: If you upgraded your instance's Linux operating system to a new major release, then you should first remove the agent and then re-install it using the procedures on this page, instead of completing these upgrade procedures.
