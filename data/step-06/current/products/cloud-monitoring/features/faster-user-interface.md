- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 162
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Feature Faster user interface : Initial page load times have been reduced across the user interface.
- October 07, 2024 Change The user interface for configuring which events to show on a dashboard has been simplified.
- To learn more, see the following: List registered and discovered services and workloads Application Monitoring overview View application telemetry April 02, 2026 Feature Application Monitoring has added support for the following resources: Vertex AI Workbench GKE Gateway GKE Ingress Layer 7 cross-regional Application Load Balancers Additionally, dashboards for Kubernetes workloads display L4 and L7 traffic metrics, when both are available.
- April 03, 2023 Change The time-range selector in select Cloud Monitoring pages has been updated to support a larger set of time range options, such as preset times, custom start and end times, and relative time ranges.

### Collect Prometheus metrics \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/ops-agent/prometheus](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/ops-agent/prometheus)
- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 144
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- You can also view your Prometheus metrics in interfaces outside Cloud Monitoring, like the Prometheus UI and Grafana .
- The full structure of the Prometheus receiver is shown in the following: metrics: receivers: prom application: type: prometheus config: scrape configs: - job name: ' STRING ' # must be unique across all Prometheus receivers scrape interval: # duration, like 10m or 15s scrape timeout: # duration, like 10m or 15s metrics path: # resource path for metrics, default = /metrics honor timestamps: # boolean, default = false scheme: # http or https, default = http params: - STRING : STRING basic auth: username: STRING password: SECRET password file: STRING authorization: type: STRING # default = Bearer credentials: SECRET credentials file: FILENAME oauth2: OAUTH2 # See Prometheus oauth2 follow redirects: # boolean, default = true enable http2: # boolean, default = true tls config: TLS CONFIG # See Prometheus tls config proxy url: STRING static configs: STATIC CONFIG # See Prometheus static config relabel configs: RELABEL CONFIG # See Prometheus relabel config metric relabel configs: METRIC RELABEL CONFIGS # See Prometheus metric relabel configs For examples of relabeling configs, see Additional receiver configuration .
- The following meta labels are available on targets for you to use in the relabel configs section: meta gce instance id : the numeric ID of the Compute Engine instance (local) meta gce instance name : the name of the Compute Engine instance (local); the Ops Agent automatically places this value in the mutable instance name label on your metrics. meta gce machine type : full or partial URL of the machine type of the instance; the Ops Agent automatically places this value in the mutable machine type label on your metrics. meta gce metadata NAME : each metadata item of the instance meta gce network : the network URL of the instance meta gce private ip : the private IP address of the instance meta gce interface ipv4 NAME : IPv4 address of each named interface meta gce project : the Google Cloud project in which the instance is running (local) meta gce public ip : the public IP address of the instance, if present meta gce tags : comma separated list of instance tags meta gce zone : the Compute Engine zone URL in which the instance is running The values of these labels are set when the Ops Agent starts.
- The prometheus target resource has the following labels, which you can use for filtering and manipulating queried data: project id : The identifier of the Google Cloud project, like my-project , in which the Ops Agent is running. location : The Google Cloud region or zone in which the Ops Agent is running; for example, us-east1-a . cluster : Always gce for Prometheus metrics collected by using the Ops Agent. namespace : The Compute Engine instance ID of the VM on which the Ops Agent is running. job : The value of the job name field in the receiver configuration. instance : The instance label of the Prometheus target, taken from the receiver configuration; defaults to the target.

### "User-defined metrics from the agent \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/custom-metrics-agent](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/custom-metrics-agent)
- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 134
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Limits Cloud Monitoring has limits on the number of metric time series and the number of user-defined metric descriptors in each project.
- The default processing will write all metrics to Cloud Monitoring , which will drop any unrecognized metrics : ones that aren ' t in the list of curated metrics and don ' t have the user - defined metric metadata . < Rule "go back" > Target "return" < / Rule > < / Chain > Load the new configuration Restart your agent to pick up the new configuration by executing the following command on your VM instance: sudo service stackdriver-agent restart Your user-defined metric information begins to flow into Monitoring.
- How Monitoring handles collectd metrics As background, the Monitoring agent processes collectd metrics and sends them to Monitoring, which treats each metric as a member of one of the following categories: User-defined metrics .
- Collectd metrics that have the metadata key stackdriver metric type and a single data source are handled as user-defined metrics and sent to Monitoring using the projects.timeSeries.create method in the Monitoring API.
