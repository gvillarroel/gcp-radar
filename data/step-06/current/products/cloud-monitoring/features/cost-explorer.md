Evidence snippets:
- July 24, 2025 Feature You can now monitor and understand the costs and utilization of resources in your Google Cloud project or App Hub application by using the Cost Explorer.
- For more information, see the following documents: Display the most recent data in tabular form API Example: Dashboard with a TimeSeriesTable widget September 06, 2024 Feature The Metrics management page in Cloud Monitoring now shows you the sources of metric reads and lets you exclude unneeded metrics entirely, eliminating the cost of ingesting them.
- For information about dashboards, see the following: Create and manage custom dashboards Install a dashboard template Import Grafana dashboards April 09, 2025 Feature Application Monitoring lets you monitor the resources and infrastructure from the perspective of an App Hub application.
- The out-of-the-box dashboards that Application Monitoring creates can help you understand how your application's resources are performing, and they can help you diagnose issues.

- List registered and discovered services and workloads App Hub lets you register infrastructure resources as services or workloads.
- These dashboards can help you understand how your application's resources are performing and to diagnose issues.
- List applications To list the applications you have registered with App Hub, along with information like the number of incidents and the application's location, criticality, and environment, do the following: In the Google Cloud console, go to the Application monitoring page: Go to Application monitoring If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Monitoring .

### Collect Prometheus metrics \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/ops-agent/prometheus](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/ops-agent/prometheus)
- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 176
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- We recommend using the Ops Agent Prometheus receiver when the following are true: You have experience using Prometheus, rely on the Prometheus standard, and understand how factors like scraping interval and cardinality can affect your costs.
- The following sections describe the query tools available in Cloud Monitoring with Metrics Explorer: PromQL Monitoring filters You can create Cloud Monitoring dashboards and alerting policies for your metrics.
- Setting up the example requires the following resources, which you might have to install: git curl make python3 Go language, version 1.19 or higher Create or configure your application To obtain and run the JSON Exporter, use the following procedure: Clone the json exporter repository and check out the exporter by running the following commands: git clone https://github.com/prometheus-community/json exporter.git cd json exporter git checkout v0.5.0 Build the exporter by running the following command: make build Start the Python HTTP server by running the following command: python3 -m http.server 8000 & Start the JSON Exporter by running the following command: ./json exporter --config.file examples/config.yml & Query the JSON Exporter to verify that it is running and exposing metrics on port 7979: curl "http://localhost:7979/probe?module=default&target=http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json" If the query was successful, then you see output that resembles the following: HELP example global value Example of a top-level global value scrape in the json TYPE example global value untyped example global value{environment="beta",location="planet-mars"} 1234 HELP example value active Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value active untyped example value active{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value active{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 1 HELP example value boolean Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value boolean untyped example value boolean{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value boolean{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 0 HELP example value count Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value count untyped example value count{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value count{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 3 In this output, the strings like example value active are the metric names, with labels and values in braces.
- The prometheus target resource has the following labels, which you can use for filtering and manipulating queried data: project id : The identifier of the Google Cloud project, like my-project , in which the Ops Agent is running. location : The Google Cloud region or zone in which the Ops Agent is running; for example, us-east1-a . cluster : Always gce for Prometheus metrics collected by using the Ops Agent. namespace : The Compute Engine instance ID of the VM on which the Ops Agent is running. job : The value of the job name field in the receiver configuration. instance : The instance label of the Prometheus target, taken from the receiver configuration; defaults to the target.
