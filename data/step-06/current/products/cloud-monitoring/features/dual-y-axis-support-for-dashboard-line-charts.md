Evidence snippets:
- The following tabs show the metric descriptor that each ingestion API creates: Prometheus API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "labels": [ { "key": "instance name" }, { "key": "machine type" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "prometheus target" ] } Monitoring API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "labels": [ { "key": "instrumentation source" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "gce instance", ...many other types deleted... ] } The following table summarizes some of the format differences imposed by the APIs used to ingest OTLP metrics: Prometheus API Monitoring API Metric domain prometheus.googleapis.com workload.googleapis.com OTLP metric name Modified during ingestion Used as provided Monitored resource prometheus target gce instance Ingestion formats and queries The metrics mode used in the OTLP receiver affects the way you query the resulting metrics in Cloud Monitoring when you build charts, dashboards, and alerting policies.
- After the Ops Agent has collected your metrics, you can use the features of Cloud Monitoring, including charts, dashboards, and alerting policies, to monitor your metrics.
- You can create charts, dashboards, and alerting policies in Monitoring for metrics of either metric format, but you refer to the metrics differently in queries.
- The metrics mode choice doesn't affect your ability to create charts, dashboards, and alerting policies in Monitoring.

Evidence snippets:
- For the JSON Exporter example, use the following procedure: Edit the Ops Agent configuration file, /etc/google-cloud-ops-agent/config.yaml , and add the following Prometheus receiver and pipeline entries: metrics: receivers: prometheus: type: prometheus config: scrape configs: - job name: 'json exporter' scrape interval: 10s metrics path: /probe params: module: [default] target: [http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json] static configs: - targets: ['localhost:7979'] service: pipelines: prometheus pipeline: receivers: - prometheus If you have other configuration entries in this file already, add the Prometheus receiver and pipeline to the existing metrics and service entries.
- You specify the values of the RECEIVER ID and PIPELINE ID . metrics: receivers: RECEIVER ID : type: prometheus config: scrape configs: [... omitted for brevity ...] service: pipelines: PIPELINE ID : receivers: [ RECEIVER ID ] The following section describes the Prometheus receiver in more detail.
- To filter for any metrics with an id label matching this pattern, use the following query: example value count{id= "id. "} For more information about using PromQL in Metrics Explorer and Cloud Monitoring charts, see PromQL in Cloud Monitoring .
- The following sections describe the query tools available in Cloud Monitoring with Metrics Explorer: PromQL Monitoring filters You can create Cloud Monitoring dashboards and alerting policies for your metrics.

- Final score: 118
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Reads from Metrics Explorer or charts on custom dashboards are "console" reads, and API reads from other sources are "other".
- For example, to list active metrics that appear in no alerting policies and in no custom dashboards, add the following filters to the filter bar: Status: Active Alert Policies: (Empty) Custom Dashboards: (Empty) By default, when you add multiple filters, the table includes a row when the row meets all filters.
- Note: The Metrics Management page lists only alerting policies and custom dashboards defined in the current project; metrics listed with no alerting policies or custom dashboards might have alerting policies or custom dashboards in another project in your metrics scope.
- It is possible have charts and alerting policies that refer to metrics with no data (inactive metrics) and to query such metrics; on the Metrics Management page, these metrics are considered used metrics, even though any read operations return no data.
