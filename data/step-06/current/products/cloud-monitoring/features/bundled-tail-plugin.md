Evidence snippets:
- Troubleshooting This section explains how to configure the Monitoring agent's write log plugin to dump out the full set of metric points, including metadata.
- To enable the plugin: As root , edit the following configuration file: /etc/stackdriver/collectd.conf Right after LoadPlugin write gcm , add: LoadPlugin write log Right after <Plugin "write gcm">…</Plugin> , add: <Plugin "write log"> Format JSON </Plugin> Search for <Target "write">…</Target> and after every Plugin "write gcm" , add: Plugin "write log" Save your changes and restart the agent: sudo service stackdriver-agent restart These changes will print one log line per metric value reported, including the full collectd identifier, the metadata entries, and the value.
- The default processing will write all metrics to Cloud Monitoring , which will drop any unrecognized metrics : ones that aren ' t in the list of curated metrics and don ' t have the user - defined metric metadata . < Rule "go back" > Target "return" < / Rule > < / Chain > Load the new configuration Restart your agent to pick up the new configuration by executing the following command on your VM instance: sudo service stackdriver-agent restart Your user-defined metric information begins to flow into Monitoring.
- Find a read plugin that works for you. (Optional) As a convenience, add the agent's collectd reference documentation to your system's man pages by updating the MANPATH variable and then running mandb : export MANPATH = "$MANPATH:/opt/stackdriver/collectd/share/man" sudo mandb The man pages are for stackdriver-collectd .

### Troubleshoot the Monitoring agent \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

Evidence snippets:
- Repository changed its 'Origin' value (Linux) You might see an error message similar to the following when upgrading the agent, installing the agent, or running apt-get update on Debian/Ubuntu Linux: E : Repository ' https : //packages.cloud.google.com/apt google-cloud-monitoring-buster-all InRelease' changed its 'Origin' value from 'google-cloud-monitoring-buster' to 'namespaces/cloud-ops-agents-artifacts/repositories/google-cloud-monitoring-buster-all' E : Repository ' https : //packages.cloud.google.com/apt google-cloud-monitoring-buster-all InRelease' changed its 'Label' value from 'google-cloud-monitoring-buster' to 'namespaces/cloud-ops-agents-artifacts/repositories/google-cloud-monitoring-buster-all' This message indicates that the package repository cache may have diverged from its source.
- Verifying project and credentials If the Monitoring agent is reporting access or authorization errors, or if the agent seems to be running normally but there is no data or your alerting policies aren't working as you expect, then check that your VM instance's credentials are correct, including that they specify the correct project: If you are using a Compute Engine VM instance with standard (not private-key) credentials, then it is unlikely that data is going to the wrong project, but your credentials might still be deficient.
- For a Linux VM, use the following command: sudo service stackdriver-agent status If the agent isn't running, you might need to restart it using the following command: sudo service stackdriver-agent restart If the restart fails, and the log output shows "Disabled via metadata", you are likely running an image from Google Cloud Marketplace , where the Monitoring agent is disabled by default.
- For example, on Linux, you can create the following crontab entry to check the agent status every 5 minutes: /5 /bin/pidof stackdriver-collectd >/dev/null 2>&1 /usr/sbin/service stackdriver-agent restart >/dev/null 2>&1 Known issues The following sections describe issues known to the Monitoring agent.

### "Install and manage the Ops Agent by using VM Extension Manager policies\

- Final score: 172
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Troubleshoot extension policies This section provides information about troubleshooting the use of extension policies to manage the Ops Agent: gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies commands fail The extension policy is created, but the Ops Agent status is "not detected" Linux systemctl and Windows Service Manager don't work with the Ops Agent For information about troubleshooting the Ops Agent, see Troubleshoot the Ops Agent . gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies commands fail When a gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies command fails, the response includes troubleshooting suggestions.
- If you haven't done so already, install the beta component of the gcloud CLI by running the following command: gcloud components install beta To check if you have the beta component installed, run the following command: gcloud components list If you previously installed the beta component, verify that have the latest version: gcloud components update Uninstall any observability agents Before creating a VM Extension Manager policy to manage the Ops Agent on a VM, ensure that there are no instances of the Ops Agent or the legacy Monitoring agent and Logging agent already on the VM.
- Enter the following query and click Run query : log id("GCEGuestAgentManager") Linux Run the following command on the Compute Engine VM: journalctl -u google-guest-agent-manager Windows Run the following command on the Compute Engine VM: Get-Eventlog -Source google guest agent manager -LogName Application If you see logs containing a string like Failed to install plugin "ops-agent-plugin" ... , or the query returns no logs, then the extension policy failed to install the Ops Agent.
- Enable the APIs Grant roles required to use the Ops Agent To get the permissions that you need to use the Ops Agent to write logs and metrics, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your service account: To write logs: Logging Logs Writer ( roles/logging.logWriter ) To write metrics: Monitoring Metric Writer ( roles/monitoring.metricWriter ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
