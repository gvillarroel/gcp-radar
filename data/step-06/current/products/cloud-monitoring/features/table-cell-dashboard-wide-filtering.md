## Supporting Pages

### View application telemetry \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/application-monitoring](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/application-monitoring)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-2`
- Final score: 96
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Those filters are applied at the dashboard level and can't be removed.
- Explore metric data The charts and tables on your dashboard display golden signals and other metric data that is relevant for the resources used by your application, service, or workload.
- The logging query includes any applicable variables , but it doesn't include dashboard-level filters.
- Filter a dashboard You can add filters to a dashboard that apply to all widgets on the dashboard.

### View and manage metric usage \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/metrics-management](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/metrics-management)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 82
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, to list active metrics that appear in no alerting policies and in no custom dashboards, add the following filters to the filter bar: Status: Active Alert Policies: (Empty) Custom Dashboards: (Empty) By default, when you add multiple filters, the table includes a row when the row meets all filters.
- For each metric, the table displays that metric's contribution to billable volume and provides links to to the alerting policies and custom dashboards associated with the metric, as shown in the following screenshot.
- Metrics used or not used in a custom dashboard in the current Google Cloud project.These filters don't include metrics that are used in predefined dashboards provided by Cloud Monitoring.
- You can only select one quick filter at a time, so you can't list only active metrics that appear in neither an alerting policy or a custom dashboard by using quick filters.

- All transformations are applied in parallel, which means that sources and filters operate on the original input log entry and therefore can not reference the new value of any other fields being modified by the same processor.
- When the Ops Agent receives external structured log data, it places top-level fields into the LogEntry 's jsonPayload field unless the field name is listed in the following table: Record field LogEntry field Option 1 "timestamp": { "seconds": CURRENT SECONDS, "nanos": CURRENT NANOS, } Option 2 { "timestampSeconds": CURRENT SECONDS, "timestampNanos": CURRENT NANOS, } timestamp receiver id (not a record field) logName logging.googleapis.com/httpRequest ( HttpRequest ) httpRequest logging.googleapis.com/severity ( string ) severity logging.googleapis.com/labels ( struct of string:string ) labels logging.googleapis.com/operation ( struct ) operation logging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation ( struct ) sourceLocation logging.googleapis.com/trace ( string ) trace logging.googleapis.com/spanId ( string ) spanId Any remaining structured record fields remain part of the jsonPayload structure.
- Example configuration logging : receivers : custom file1 : type : files include paths : - /tmp/test-multiline28 processors : parse java multiline : type : parse multiline match any : - type : language exceptions language : java extract structure : type : parse regex field : message regex : "^(?<time>[ \ d-] T[ \ d:.Z] ) (?<severity>[^ ] ) (?<file>[^ :] ):(?<line>[ \ d] ) - (?<message>(. \\n) )$" time key : time time format : "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%L" move severity : type : modify fields fields : severity : move from : jsonPayload.severity service : pipelines : pipeline1 : receivers : [ custom file1 ] processors : [ parse java multiline , extract structure , move severity ] In the extract structure processor, the field: message statement means that the regular expression is applied to the log entry's jsonPayload.message field.
