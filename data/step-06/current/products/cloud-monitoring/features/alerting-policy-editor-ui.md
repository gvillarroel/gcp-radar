Evidence snippets:
- Cloud Monitoring supports the following tools for querying metric data: A query-builder based interface built into tools like Metrics Explorer, the dashboard-builder interface, and the alert-policy configuration interface.
- The following tabs show the metric descriptor that each ingestion API creates: Prometheus API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "labels": [ { "key": "instance name" }, { "key": "machine type" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "prometheus target" ] } Monitoring API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "labels": [ { "key": "instrumentation source" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "gce instance", ...many other types deleted... ] } The following table summarizes some of the format differences imposed by the APIs used to ingest OTLP metrics: Prometheus API Monitoring API Metric domain prometheus.googleapis.com workload.googleapis.com OTLP metric name Modified during ingestion Used as provided Monitored resource prometheus target gce instance Ingestion formats and queries The metrics mode used in the OTLP receiver affects the way you query the resulting metrics in Cloud Monitoring when you build charts, dashboards, and alerting policies.
- When you configure a chart, dashboard, or alerting policy in Cloud Monitoring, the configuration includes a query for the data on which the chart, dashboard, or alerting policy operates.
- Query-builder interface To use a query-builder interface to query metric data, you specify the metric type and the monitored-resource type by typing into search-enabled fields.
