### Collect Prometheus metrics \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

Evidence snippets:
- For the JSON Exporter example, use the following procedure: Edit the Ops Agent configuration file, /etc/google-cloud-ops-agent/config.yaml , and add the following Prometheus receiver and pipeline entries: metrics: receivers: prometheus: type: prometheus config: scrape configs: - job name: 'json exporter' scrape interval: 10s metrics path: /probe params: module: [default] target: [http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json] static configs: - targets: ['localhost:7979'] service: pipelines: prometheus pipeline: receivers: - prometheus If you have other configuration entries in this file already, add the Prometheus receiver and pipeline to the existing metrics and service entries.
- Configuration for Prometheus metrics Configuring the Ops Agent to ingest Prometheus metrics differs from the usual configuration as follows: You don't create an Ops Agent processor for Prometheus metrics.
- Setting up the example requires the following resources, which you might have to install: git curl make python3 Go language, version 1.19 or higher Create or configure your application To obtain and run the JSON Exporter, use the following procedure: Clone the json exporter repository and check out the exporter by running the following commands: git clone https://github.com/prometheus-community/json exporter.git cd json exporter git checkout v0.5.0 Build the exporter by running the following command: make build Start the Python HTTP server by running the following command: python3 -m http.server 8000 & Start the JSON Exporter by running the following command: ./json exporter --config.file examples/config.yml & Query the JSON Exporter to verify that it is running and exposing metrics on port 7979: curl "http://localhost:7979/probe?module=default&target=http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json" If the query was successful, then you see output that resembles the following: HELP example global value Example of a top-level global value scrape in the json TYPE example global value untyped example global value{environment="beta",location="planet-mars"} 1234 HELP example value active Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value active untyped example value active{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value active{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 1 HELP example value boolean Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value boolean untyped example value boolean{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value boolean{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 0 HELP example value count Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value count untyped example value count{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value count{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 3 In this output, the strings like example value active are the metric names, with labels and values in braces.
- The full structure of the Prometheus receiver is shown in the following: metrics: receivers: prom application: type: prometheus config: scrape configs: - job name: ' STRING ' # must be unique across all Prometheus receivers scrape interval: # duration, like 10m or 15s scrape timeout: # duration, like 10m or 15s metrics path: # resource path for metrics, default = /metrics honor timestamps: # boolean, default = false scheme: # http or https, default = http params: - STRING : STRING basic auth: username: STRING password: SECRET password file: STRING authorization: type: STRING # default = Bearer credentials: SECRET credentials file: FILENAME oauth2: OAUTH2 # See Prometheus oauth2 follow redirects: # boolean, default = true enable http2: # boolean, default = true tls config: TLS CONFIG # See Prometheus tls config proxy url: STRING static configs: STATIC CONFIG # See Prometheus static config relabel configs: RELABEL CONFIG # See Prometheus relabel config metric relabel configs: METRIC RELABEL CONFIGS # See Prometheus metric relabel configs For examples of relabeling configs, see Additional receiver configuration .
