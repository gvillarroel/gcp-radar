Evidence snippets:
- Enable the APIs Grant roles required to use the Ops Agent To get the permissions that you need to use the Ops Agent to write logs and metrics, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your service account: To write logs: Logging Logs Writer ( roles/logging.logWriter ) To write metrics: Monitoring Metric Writer ( roles/monitoring.metricWriter ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- Verify that the Ops Agent is collecting telemetry If the Ops Agent has been successfully installed and is running correctly, then it sends metrics to Cloud Monitoring and logs to Cloud Logging.
- Enable the APIs required to use the Ops Agent To use the Ops Agent to write logs and metrics, you must enable the Cloud Logging API and Cloud Monitoring API on your Google Cloud project.
- If you haven't done so already, install the beta component of the gcloud CLI by running the following command: gcloud components install beta To check if you have the beta component installed, run the following command: gcloud components list If you previously installed the beta component, verify that have the latest version: gcloud components update Uninstall any observability agents Before creating a VM Extension Manager policy to manage the Ops Agent on a VM, ensure that there are no instances of the Ops Agent or the legacy Monitoring agent and Logging agent already on the VM.

- Final score: 236
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The beta and GA policies are also structurally different: Policies created by using gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies describe agent policies by passing individual options to the commands, for example: gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create ops-agents-test-policy \ --agent-rules = "type=logging,enable-autoupgrade=false;type=metrics,enable-autoupgrade=false" \ --description = "A test policy." \ --os-types = short-name = centos,version = 7 \ --instances = zones/us-central1-a/instances/test-instance \ --project PROJECT ID The agent-policy Terraform module provides the same capabilities.
- Supported operating systems You can apply an agent policy to Compute Engine VM instances running the operating systems shown in the following table: Operating system Ops Agent (GA & beta † policies) Logging agent (beta † policies only) Monitoring agent (beta † policies only) CentOS 8 Rocky Linux 8 RHEL 6 RHEL 7: rhel-7, rhel-7-6-sap-ha, rhel-7-7-sap-ha, rhel-7-9-sap-ha ‡ RHEL 8: rhel-8, rhel-8-4-sap-ha, rhel-8-6-sap-ha, rhel-8-8-sap-ha ‡ Debian 9 (Stretch) Debian 11 (Bullseye) Deep Learning VM Images based on Debian 11 (Bullseye) Ubuntu LTS 18.04 (Bionic Beaver): ubuntu-1804-lts, ubuntu-minimal-1804-lts Ubuntu LTS 20.04 (Focal Fossa): ubuntu-2004-lts, ubuntu-minimal-2004-lts Ubuntu LTS 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish): buntu-2204-lts, ubuntu-minimal-2204-lts SLES 12: sles-12, sles-12-sp5-sap SLES 15: sles-15, sles-15-sp2-sap, sles-15-sp3-sap, sles-15-sp4-sap, sles-15-sp5-sap, sles-15-sp6-sap OpenSUSE Leap 15: opensuse-leap (opensuse-leap-15-3- , opensuse-leap-15-4- ) Windows Server: 2016, 2019, 2022, Core 2016, Core 2019, Core 2022 † In beta agent policies, the agent columns map to an agent type specified to the gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create invocation: Ops Agent maps to agent type ops-agent .
- This section describes the differences between the beta and GA agent policies For information about creating and managing agent policies, see the following: Use agent policies (GA) Use agent policies (beta) Differences between beta and GA agent policies The beta and GA agent policies differ in the following ways: Creation mechanisms Beta agent policies are created by using the following: The gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies command group in the Google Cloud SDK.

Evidence snippets:
- To verify that the agent is working as expected, run: sudo systemctl status google-cloud-ops-agent" " Verify that the components "Logging Agent" and "Metrics Agent" are running.
- If you've installed and started the Ops Agent but the status remains Not detected , then the agent might not have started correctly or is unable to send metrics.
- If you've installed and started the Ops Agent but the status remains Not detected , then the agent might not have started correctly or is unable to send metrics.
- The Ops Agent collects logs and metrics on Compute Engine instances, sending your logs to Cloud Logging and your metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
