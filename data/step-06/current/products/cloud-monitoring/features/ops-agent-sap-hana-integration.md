Evidence snippets:
- Supported operating systems You can apply an agent policy to Compute Engine VM instances running the operating systems shown in the following table: Operating system Ops Agent (GA & beta † policies) Logging agent (beta † policies only) Monitoring agent (beta † policies only) CentOS 8 Rocky Linux 8 RHEL 6 RHEL 7: rhel-7, rhel-7-6-sap-ha, rhel-7-7-sap-ha, rhel-7-9-sap-ha ‡ RHEL 8: rhel-8, rhel-8-4-sap-ha, rhel-8-6-sap-ha, rhel-8-8-sap-ha ‡ Debian 9 (Stretch) Debian 11 (Bullseye) Deep Learning VM Images based on Debian 11 (Bullseye) Ubuntu LTS 18.04 (Bionic Beaver): ubuntu-1804-lts, ubuntu-minimal-1804-lts Ubuntu LTS 20.04 (Focal Fossa): ubuntu-2004-lts, ubuntu-minimal-2004-lts Ubuntu LTS 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish): buntu-2204-lts, ubuntu-minimal-2204-lts SLES 12: sles-12, sles-12-sp5-sap SLES 15: sles-15, sles-15-sp2-sap, sles-15-sp3-sap, sles-15-sp4-sap, sles-15-sp5-sap, sles-15-sp6-sap OpenSUSE Leap 15: opensuse-leap (opensuse-leap-15-3- , opensuse-leap-15-4- ) Windows Server: 2016, 2019, 2022, Core 2016, Core 2019, Core 2022 † In beta agent policies, the agent columns map to an agent type specified to the gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create invocation: Ops Agent maps to agent type ops-agent .
- You can have beta and GA agent policies that apply to the same VM, but you need to ensure that the policies don't have conflicting purposes, for example, a beta policy that installs the Ops Agent and a GA policy that uninstalls the Ops Agent.
- You can create a policy for a Google Cloud project that governs existing and new VMs associated with that Google Cloud project, ensuring proper installation and uninstallation of the Ops Agent on those VMs.

### Collect Prometheus metrics \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 198
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The prometheus target resource has the following labels, which you can use for filtering and manipulating queried data: project id : The identifier of the Google Cloud project, like my-project , in which the Ops Agent is running. location : The Google Cloud region or zone in which the Ops Agent is running; for example, us-east1-a . cluster : Always gce for Prometheus metrics collected by using the Ops Agent. namespace : The Compute Engine instance ID of the VM on which the Ops Agent is running. job : The value of the job name field in the receiver configuration. instance : The instance label of the Prometheus target, taken from the receiver configuration; defaults to the target.
- To restart the agent, run the following PowerShell command: Restart-Service google-cloud-ops-agent -Force To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started: Get-Service google-cloud-ops-agent Prometheus metrics in Cloud Monitoring You can use the tools provided by Cloud Monitoring with the data collected by the Prometheus receiver.
- When Prometheus metrics are emitted by an application, directly or by using a library or exporter, the metrics can then be collected by an Ops Agent configured with a Prometheus receiver.
- This document describes the configuration and use of an Ops Agent metrics receiver that you can use to collect metrics from Prometheus on Compute Engine.

- Combining the collection of logs, metrics, and traces into a single process, the Ops Agent uses Fluent Bit for logs, which supports high-throughput logging, and the OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics and traces.
- To collect OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) traces, you must configure the agent to collect traces from an instrumented application; for more information, see Collect (OTLP) traces with the Ops Agent .
