- This sets the HTTP PROXY and HTTPS PROXY environment variables so that the agent can send data using outbound HTTPS: setx HTTP PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx HTTPS PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx no proxy "metadata.google.internal,169.254.169.254" /m Determine the agent version To determine the version of the Ops Agent on your system, run the following commands on your VM instance: Google Cloud console To see the version of your Ops Agent on a VM: Locate the entry for the VM in the Instances table in the Monitoring VM Instances page.
- However, the status might be inaccurate if the VM lacks necessary access scopes or if the associated service account has insufficient IAM roles. gcpdiag : gcpdiag provides more reliable and robust information about agent status than the VM Instances dashboard, verifying both agent installation and transmission of telemetry from the VM.
- The List view on the Inventory tab on the dashboard lists all VMs and includes a status column for your agent, as shown in the following screenshot: The Agent column reports the following values: Not detected : Either you don't have an agent installed or it is not running.
- Verify that the Ops Agent is running To verify that the Ops Agent is running, you can use either of the following: VM Instances dashboard : This dashboard lets you view the agent installation status across your VM fleet.

- Data visualization As you instantiate Google Cloud resources or register applications with App Hub , the dashboard service automatically creates Google Cloud-managed dashboards .
- To complete these tasks, you can use the dashboard and charting services: To control what data you view and the display format for that data, create a custom dashboard .
- For example, when a Google Cloud project contains multiple Compute Engine VM instances, the CPU utilization for each VM instance is a unique time series.

- Explore metric data The charts and tables on your dashboard display golden signals and other metric data that is relevant for the resources used by your application, service, or workload.
- For each supported App Hub region , this page lists at most 100 discovered services and 100 discovered workloads: The App Hub Type column displays the App Hub registration type : Service ( ) Workload ( ) The Functional Type column displays the App Hub functional type : Agent ( robot 2 ) MCP server ( ) From the Services and Workloads tab, you can do all of the following: Modify the data the table displays by using the view column Columns button.
- This is the project that you use to view your application's telemetry data: To get the permissions that you need to view log and metric data, and to create alerting policies and customize dashboards, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) on your App Hub host project or management project and any other projects listed in its default log scope.
- The following screenshot illustrates the dashboard for a workload: The registration status of a service or workload affects what data Application Monitoring displays on the dashboard for the service or workload: Registered : Application Monitoring uses the application-specific labels and attributes that supported infrastructure and instrumented applications attach to the telemetry they generate.
