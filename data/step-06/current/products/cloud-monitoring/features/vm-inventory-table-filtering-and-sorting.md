Evidence snippets:
- If you haven't done so already, install the beta component of the gcloud CLI by running the following command: gcloud components install beta To check if you have the beta component installed, run the following command: gcloud components list If you previously installed the beta component, verify that have the latest version: gcloud components update Uninstall any observability agents Before creating a VM Extension Manager policy to manage the Ops Agent on a VM, ensure that there are no instances of the Ops Agent or the legacy Monitoring agent and Logging agent already on the VM.
- For more information about sorting and filtering options, see gcloud beta compute global-vm-extension-policies list .
- For more information about sorting and filtering options, see gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies list .
- For example, suppose you created and rolled out a global policy by using the following command: gcloud beta compute global-vm-extension-policies create POLICY NAME \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --extensions=ops-agent \ --version=ops-agent=2.61.0 \ --rollout-predefined-plan=slow rollout \ --config-from-file=ops-agent="/usr/ops-agent-config.yaml" To extend the policy to VMs created in previously unused zones, restart the rollout by using the following command: gcloud beta compute global-vm-extension-policies update test-policy POLICY NAME \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --extensions=ops-agent \ --version=ops-agent=2.61.0 \ --rollout-predefined-plan=slow rollout \ --config-from-file=ops-agent="/usr/ops-agent-config.yaml" \ --rollout-retry-uuid= UUID Replace the following variables in the command: POLICY NAME : A name for the VM extension policy.

Evidence snippets:
- This sets the HTTP PROXY and HTTPS PROXY environment variables so that the agent can send data using outbound HTTPS: setx HTTP PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx HTTPS PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx no proxy "metadata.google.internal,169.254.169.254" /m Determine the agent version To determine the version of the Ops Agent on your system, run the following commands on your VM instance: Google Cloud console To see the version of your Ops Agent on a VM: Locate the entry for the VM in the Instances table in the Monitoring VM Instances page.
- However, the status might be inaccurate if the VM lacks necessary access scopes or if the associated service account has insufficient IAM roles. gcpdiag : gcpdiag provides more reliable and robust information about agent status than the VM Instances dashboard, verifying both agent installation and transmission of telemetry from the VM.
- The List view on the Inventory tab on the dashboard lists all VMs and includes a status column for your agent, as shown in the following screenshot: The Agent column reports the following values: Not detected : Either you don't have an agent installed or it is not running.
- The List view on the Inventory tab on the dashboard lists all VMs and includes a status column for your agent.
