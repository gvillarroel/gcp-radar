Evidence snippets:
- The full structure of the Prometheus receiver is shown in the following: metrics: receivers: prom application: type: prometheus config: scrape configs: - job name: ' STRING ' # must be unique across all Prometheus receivers scrape interval: # duration, like 10m or 15s scrape timeout: # duration, like 10m or 15s metrics path: # resource path for metrics, default = /metrics honor timestamps: # boolean, default = false scheme: # http or https, default = http params: - STRING : STRING basic auth: username: STRING password: SECRET password file: STRING authorization: type: STRING # default = Bearer credentials: SECRET credentials file: FILENAME oauth2: OAUTH2 # See Prometheus oauth2 follow redirects: # boolean, default = true enable http2: # boolean, default = true tls config: TLS CONFIG # See Prometheus tls config proxy url: STRING static configs: STATIC CONFIG # See Prometheus static config relabel configs: RELABEL CONFIG # See Prometheus relabel config metric relabel configs: METRIC RELABEL CONFIGS # See Prometheus metric relabel configs For examples of relabeling configs, see Additional receiver configuration .
- The following meta labels are available on targets for you to use in the relabel configs section: meta gce instance id : the numeric ID of the Compute Engine instance (local) meta gce instance name : the name of the Compute Engine instance (local); the Ops Agent automatically places this value in the mutable instance name label on your metrics. meta gce machine type : full or partial URL of the machine type of the instance; the Ops Agent automatically places this value in the mutable machine type label on your metrics. meta gce metadata NAME : each metadata item of the instance meta gce network : the network URL of the instance meta gce private ip : the private IP address of the instance meta gce interface ipv4 NAME : IPv4 address of each named interface meta gce project : the Google Cloud project in which the instance is running (local) meta gce public ip : the public IP address of the instance, if present meta gce tags : comma separated list of instance tags meta gce zone : the Compute Engine zone URL in which the instance is running The values of these labels are set when the Ops Agent starts.
- The prometheus target resource has the following labels, which you can use for filtering and manipulating queried data: project id : The identifier of the Google Cloud project, like my-project , in which the Ops Agent is running. location : The Google Cloud region or zone in which the Ops Agent is running; for example, us-east1-a . cluster : Always gce for Prometheus metrics collected by using the Ops Agent. namespace : The Compute Engine instance ID of the VM on which the Ops Agent is running. job : The value of the job name field in the receiver configuration. instance : The instance label of the Prometheus target, taken from the receiver configuration; defaults to the target.
- The following sections describe the query tools available in Cloud Monitoring with Metrics Explorer: PromQL Monitoring filters You can create Cloud Monitoring dashboards and alerting policies for your metrics.

Evidence snippets:
- The following tabs show the metric descriptor that each ingestion API creates: Prometheus API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "labels": [ { "key": "instance name" }, { "key": "machine type" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "prometheus target" ] } Monitoring API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "labels": [ { "key": "instrumentation source" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "gce instance", ...many other types deleted... ] } The following table summarizes some of the format differences imposed by the APIs used to ingest OTLP metrics: Prometheus API Monitoring API Metric domain prometheus.googleapis.com workload.googleapis.com OTLP metric name Modified during ingestion Used as provided Monitored resource prometheus target gce instance Ingestion formats and queries The metrics mode used in the OTLP receiver affects the way you query the resulting metrics in Cloud Monitoring when you build charts, dashboards, and alerting policies.
- Trivial PromQL queries for the example metrics look like the following: workload googleapis com:otlp test gauge{monitored resource="gce instance"} workload googleapis com:otlp test cumulative{monitored resource="gce instance"} The following screenshot shows the result of querying the workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.gauge metric: The following screenshot shows the result of querying the workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative metric: View metric usage and diagnostics in Cloud Monitoring The Cloud Monitoring Metrics Management page provides information that can help you control the amount you spend on billable metrics without affecting observability.
- The Monitoring metric types for the example metrics are mapped to PromQL as follows: workload googleapis com:otlp test gauge workload googleapis com:otlp test cumulative When the metric can be written against only one monitored-resource type, you don't need to specify the resource.
- Prometheus API: When you use the Prometheus API to ingest your application's metrics, each metric is transformed by using the standard OpenTelemetry-to-Prometheus transformation and mapped to a Cloud Monitoring monitored-resource type.
