Evidence snippets:
- The release introduces new monitored resource types and new Kubernetes metrics .
- July 13, 2021 Change Metrics Explorer, a stand-alone charting tool that lets you quickly chart and explore time-series data, has a new interface and supports enhanced aggregation options.
- Additionally, a new version of Metrics Explorer is available, and the metric-selection interface has been greatly improved, allowing arbitrary label filtering and group-by functionality.
- This interface, based on Metrics Explorer, offers fine-grained control over the selection of the metrics used in alerting conditions.

### Collect Prometheus metrics \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/ops-agent/prometheus](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/ops-agent/prometheus)
- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 162
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The simplest way to verify that your Prometheus data is being ingested is to use the Cloud Monitoring Metrics Explorer page in the Google Cloud console: In the Google Cloud console, go to the leaderboard Metrics explorer page: Go to Metrics explorer If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Monitoring .
- For Prometheus metrics, the monitored-resource type is prometheus target .
- Setting up the example requires the following resources, which you might have to install: git curl make python3 Go language, version 1.19 or higher Create or configure your application To obtain and run the JSON Exporter, use the following procedure: Clone the json exporter repository and check out the exporter by running the following commands: git clone https://github.com/prometheus-community/json exporter.git cd json exporter git checkout v0.5.0 Build the exporter by running the following command: make build Start the Python HTTP server by running the following command: python3 -m http.server 8000 & Start the JSON Exporter by running the following command: ./json exporter --config.file examples/config.yml & Query the JSON Exporter to verify that it is running and exposing metrics on port 7979: curl "http://localhost:7979/probe?module=default&target=http://localhost:8000/examples/data.json" If the query was successful, then you see output that resembles the following: HELP example global value Example of a top-level global value scrape in the json TYPE example global value untyped example global value{environment="beta",location="planet-mars"} 1234 HELP example value active Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value active untyped example value active{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value active{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 1 HELP example value boolean Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value boolean untyped example value boolean{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value boolean{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 0 HELP example value count Example of sub-level value scrapes from a json TYPE example value count untyped example value count{environment="beta",id="id-A"} 1 example value count{environment="beta",id="id-C"} 3 In this output, the strings like example value active are the metric names, with labels and values in braces.
- The full structure of the Prometheus receiver is shown in the following: metrics: receivers: prom application: type: prometheus config: scrape configs: - job name: ' STRING ' # must be unique across all Prometheus receivers scrape interval: # duration, like 10m or 15s scrape timeout: # duration, like 10m or 15s metrics path: # resource path for metrics, default = /metrics honor timestamps: # boolean, default = false scheme: # http or https, default = http params: - STRING : STRING basic auth: username: STRING password: SECRET password file: STRING authorization: type: STRING # default = Bearer credentials: SECRET credentials file: FILENAME oauth2: OAUTH2 # See Prometheus oauth2 follow redirects: # boolean, default = true enable http2: # boolean, default = true tls config: TLS CONFIG # See Prometheus tls config proxy url: STRING static configs: STATIC CONFIG # See Prometheus static config relabel configs: RELABEL CONFIG # See Prometheus relabel config metric relabel configs: METRIC RELABEL CONFIGS # See Prometheus metric relabel configs For examples of relabeling configs, see Additional receiver configuration .

### "Collect OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) metrics and traces \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/ops-agent/otlp](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/ops-agent/otlp)
- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 148
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The following tabs show the metric descriptor that each ingestion API creates: Prometheus API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "labels": [ { "key": "instance name" }, { "key": "machine type" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "prometheus target" ] } Monitoring API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "labels": [ { "key": "instrumentation source" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "gce instance", ...many other types deleted... ] } The following table summarizes some of the format differences imposed by the APIs used to ingest OTLP metrics: Prometheus API Monitoring API Metric domain prometheus.googleapis.com workload.googleapis.com OTLP metric name Modified during ingestion Used as provided Monitored resource prometheus target gce instance Ingestion formats and queries The metrics mode used in the OTLP receiver affects the way you query the resulting metrics in Cloud Monitoring when you build charts, dashboards, and alerting policies.
- These metrics are ingested into Cloud Monitoring with the following metric types, which function as names: prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test gauge/gauge prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter Metrics ingested by using the Prometheus API are written against the monitored-resource type prometheus target .
- These metrics are ingested into Cloud Monitoring with the following metric types, which function as names: workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.gauge workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative Metrics ingested by using the Monitoring API are written against the monitored-resource type gce instance .
- The Monitoring metric types for the example metrics are mapped to PromQL as follows: workload googleapis com:otlp test gauge workload googleapis com:otlp test cumulative When the metric can be written against only one monitored-resource type, you don't need to specify the resource.
