Evidence snippets:
- This sets the HTTP PROXY and HTTPS PROXY environment variables so that the agent can send data using outbound HTTPS: setx HTTP PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx HTTPS PROXY http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx no proxy 169.254.169.254 /m Determine the agent version To determine the version of the Monitoring agent on your system, run the following commands on your VM instance: DEBIAN / UBUNTU Run the following command on Debian or Ubuntu: dpkg-query --show --showformat ' ${ Package } ${ Version } ${ Architecture } ${ Status } \n' stackdriver-agent SLES / SUSE Run the following command on SUSE: rpm --query --queryformat '%{NAME} %{VERSION} %{RELEASE} %{ARCH}\n' stackdriver-agent WINDOWS There is presently no way to determine the version of the Monitoring agent running on Windows.

- Configure an HTTP proxy If you use an HTTP proxy for proxying requests to the Logging and Monitoring APIs, do the following: Linux Edit the following configuration file (create the file if it doesn't already exist): For agent versions 6.0.0 and higher, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-agent For agent versions earlier than 6.0.0, edit the appropriate file for your OS: For Debian and Ubuntu, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-agent For CentOS and SLES, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-collectd Note: If this file doesn't exist, create it.
- Run the following PowerShell command: Restart-Service -Name StackdriverMonitoring Upgrade the agent To upgrade the Monitoring agent to the latest release, use the following instructions: Note: If you upgraded your instance's Linux operating system to a new major release, then you should first remove the agent and then re-install it using the procedures on this page, instead of completing these upgrade procedures.

Evidence snippets:
- Supported operating systems You can apply an agent policy to Compute Engine VM instances running the operating systems shown in the following table: Operating system Ops Agent (GA & beta † policies) Logging agent (beta † policies only) Monitoring agent (beta † policies only) CentOS 8 Rocky Linux 8 RHEL 6 RHEL 7: rhel-7, rhel-7-6-sap-ha, rhel-7-7-sap-ha, rhel-7-9-sap-ha ‡ RHEL 8: rhel-8, rhel-8-4-sap-ha, rhel-8-6-sap-ha, rhel-8-8-sap-ha ‡ Debian 9 (Stretch) Debian 11 (Bullseye) Deep Learning VM Images based on Debian 11 (Bullseye) Ubuntu LTS 18.04 (Bionic Beaver): ubuntu-1804-lts, ubuntu-minimal-1804-lts Ubuntu LTS 20.04 (Focal Fossa): ubuntu-2004-lts, ubuntu-minimal-2004-lts Ubuntu LTS 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish): buntu-2204-lts, ubuntu-minimal-2204-lts SLES 12: sles-12, sles-12-sp5-sap SLES 15: sles-15, sles-15-sp2-sap, sles-15-sp3-sap, sles-15-sp4-sap, sles-15-sp5-sap, sles-15-sp6-sap OpenSUSE Leap 15: opensuse-leap (opensuse-leap-15-3- , opensuse-leap-15-4- ) Windows Server: 2016, 2019, 2022, Core 2016, Core 2019, Core 2022 † In beta agent policies, the agent columns map to an agent type specified to the gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create invocation: Ops Agent maps to agent type ops-agent .
- Here is an example of a phased rollout plan for Debian 11 VMs in a project called my project : Phase 1: Create a policy named ops-agents-policy-safe-rollout to install the legacy Logging agent and Monitoring agent on all VMs with the labels env=test and app=myproduct . gcloud beta compute instances \ ops - agents policies create ops - agents - policy - safe - rollout \ -- agent - rules = "type=logging,version=current-major,package-state=installed,enable-autoupgrade=true;type=metrics,version=current-major,package-state=installed,enable-autoupgrade=true" \ -- os - types = short - name = debian , version = 11 \ -- group - labels = env = test , app = myproduct \ -- project = my project For more information about specifying the operating system, see gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create .
- To enable the APIs, grant the necessary roles to the default service account, and enable the OS Config metadata for a project, run the script as follows: bash set-permissions.sh --project= PROJECT ID To additionally grant one of the OS Config roles to a user who does not have the Owner ( roles/owner ) role on the project, run the script as follows: bash set-permissions.sh --project= PROJECT ID \ --iam-user= USER EMAIL \ --iam-permission-role=guestPolicy [Admin Editor Viewer] To additionally grant one of the OS Config roles to a non-default service account, run the script as follows: bash set-permissions.sh --project= PROJECT ID \ --iam-service-account= SERVICE ACCT EMAIL \ --iam-permission-role=guestPolicy [Admin Editor Viewer] The diagnose.sh script Given a project ID, a Compute Engine instance ID, and the agent policy ID, the diagnose.sh script automatically collects the necessary information to help diagnose issues with the policy: The OS Config agent version The underlying OS Config guest policy The policies that are applicable to this Compute Engine instance The agent package repositories that are pulled on to this Compute Engine instance To invoke the script, run the following command: bash diagnose.sh --project-id= PROJECT ID \ --gce-instance-id= INSTANCE ID \ --policy-id= POLICY ID Terraform integration To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see Basic Terraform commands .
- To verify that the OS Config metadata is enabled, you can run the following command: gcloud compute project-info describe \ --project PROJECT ID \ grep "enable-osconfig\ enable-guest-attributes" -A 1 The expected output follows: - key: enable-guest-attributes value: 'TRUE' - key: enable-osconfig value: 'TRUE' Observability agents are installed, but not functioning properly For information about debugging specific agents, see the following documents: Troubleshoot the Ops Agent Troubleshoot the legacy Logging agent Troubleshoot the legacy Monitoring agent Enable debug-level logs for the OS Config agent It can be useful to enable debug-level logging in the OS Config agent when reporting an issue.
