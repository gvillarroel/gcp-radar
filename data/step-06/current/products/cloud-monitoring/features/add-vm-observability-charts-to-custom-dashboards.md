Evidence snippets:
- You can use these labels and the Prometheus receiver's relabel configs section to add additional metadata to your metrics about the VM from which they were ingested.
- Add VM metadata You can use the relabel configs section to add labels to metrics.
- Use of metrics in alerting policies and custom dashboards.
- The following meta labels are available on targets for you to use in the relabel configs section: meta gce instance id : the numeric ID of the Compute Engine instance (local) meta gce instance name : the name of the Compute Engine instance (local); the Ops Agent automatically places this value in the mutable instance name label on your metrics. meta gce machine type : full or partial URL of the machine type of the instance; the Ops Agent automatically places this value in the mutable machine type label on your metrics. meta gce metadata NAME : each metadata item of the instance meta gce network : the network URL of the instance meta gce private ip : the private IP address of the instance meta gce interface ipv4 NAME : IPv4 address of each named interface meta gce project : the Google Cloud project in which the instance is running (local) meta gce public ip : the public IP address of the instance, if present meta gce tags : comma separated list of instance tags meta gce zone : the Compute Engine zone URL in which the instance is running The values of these labels are set when the Ops Agent starts.

### "Collect OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) metrics and traces \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring\

Evidence snippets:
- The following tabs show the metric descriptor that each ingestion API creates: Prometheus API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "labels": [ { "key": "instance name" }, { "key": "machine type" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "prometheus target" ] } Monitoring API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "labels": [ { "key": "instrumentation source" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "gce instance", ...many other types deleted... ] } The following table summarizes some of the format differences imposed by the APIs used to ingest OTLP metrics: Prometheus API Monitoring API Metric domain prometheus.googleapis.com workload.googleapis.com OTLP metric name Modified during ingestion Used as provided Monitored resource prometheus target gce instance Ingestion formats and queries The metrics mode used in the OTLP receiver affects the way you query the resulting metrics in Cloud Monitoring when you build charts, dashboards, and alerting policies.
- After the Ops Agent has collected your metrics, you can use the features of Cloud Monitoring, including charts, dashboards, and alerting policies, to monitor your metrics.
- You can create charts, dashboards, and alerting policies in Monitoring for metrics of either metric format, but you refer to the metrics differently in queries.
- The metrics mode choice doesn't affect your ability to create charts, dashboards, and alerting policies in Monitoring.
