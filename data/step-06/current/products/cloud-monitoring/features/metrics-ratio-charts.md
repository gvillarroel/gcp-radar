### View and manage metric usage \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/metrics-management](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/metrics-management)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 192
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Reads from Metrics Explorer or charts on custom dashboards are "console" reads, and API reads from other sources are "other".
- It is possible have charts and alerting policies that refer to metrics with no data (inactive metrics) and to query such metrics; on the Metrics Management page, these metrics are considered used metrics, even though any read operations return no data.
- Find the metric in the table, and then click more vert Actions to do any of the following: To view a chart that displays the current metric, select View in Metrics Explorer .
- To analyze any of these charts in more detail, click more vert More options and select View in Metrics Explorer .

### "Collect OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) metrics and traces \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring\

- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Cloud Monitoring supports the following tools for querying metric data: A query-builder based interface built into tools like Metrics Explorer, the dashboard-builder interface, and the alert-policy configuration interface.
- After the Ops Agent has collected your metrics, you can use the features of Cloud Monitoring, including charts, dashboards, and alerting policies, to monitor your metrics.
- You can create charts, dashboards, and alerting policies in Monitoring for metrics of either metric format, but you refer to the metrics differently in queries.
- The following tabs show the metric descriptor that each ingestion API creates: Prometheus API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "labels": [ { "key": "instance name" }, { "key": "machine type" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "prometheus.googleapis.com/otlp test cumulative/counter", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "prometheus target" ] } Monitoring API { "name": "projects/ PROJECT ID /metricDescriptors/workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "labels": [ { "key": "instrumentation source" } ], "metricKind": "CUMULATIVE", "valueType": "DOUBLE", "type": "workload.googleapis.com/otlp.test.cumulative", "monitoredResourceTypes": [ "gce instance", ...many other types deleted... ] } The following table summarizes some of the format differences imposed by the APIs used to ingest OTLP metrics: Prometheus API Monitoring API Metric domain prometheus.googleapis.com workload.googleapis.com OTLP metric name Modified during ingestion Used as provided Monitored resource prometheus target gce instance Ingestion formats and queries The metrics mode used in the OTLP receiver affects the way you query the resulting metrics in Cloud Monitoring when you build charts, dashboards, and alerting policies.
