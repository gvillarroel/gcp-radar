Evidence snippets:
- Run the following PowerShell command: Restart-Service -Name StackdriverMonitoring Upgrade the agent To upgrade the Monitoring agent to the latest release, use the following instructions: Note: If you upgraded your instance's Linux operating system to a new major release, then you should first remove the agent and then re-install it using the procedures on this page, instead of completing these upgrade procedures.
- To install a specific version of the agent, run: sudo bash add-monitoring-agent-repo.sh --also-install \ --version= MAJOR VERSION.MINOR VERSION.PATCH VERSION Start the agent service sudo service stackdriver-agent start You can delete the installation script after it runs successfully.
- To install the agent silently, append the /S option to the invocation of the installer: & "${env:UserProfile}\StackdriverMonitoring-GCM-46.exe" /S Caution: Silent installation is an asynchronous operation.
- Configure an HTTP proxy If you use an HTTP proxy for proxying requests to the Logging and Monitoring APIs, do the following: Linux Edit the following configuration file (create the file if it doesn't already exist): For agent versions 6.0.0 and higher, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-agent For agent versions earlier than 6.0.0, edit the appropriate file for your OS: For Debian and Ubuntu, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-agent For CentOS and SLES, edit: /etc/default/stackdriver-collectd Note: If this file doesn't exist, create it.

Evidence snippets:
- Supported operating systems You can apply an agent policy to Compute Engine VM instances running the operating systems shown in the following table: Operating system Ops Agent (GA & beta † policies) Logging agent (beta † policies only) Monitoring agent (beta † policies only) CentOS 8 Rocky Linux 8 RHEL 6 RHEL 7: rhel-7, rhel-7-6-sap-ha, rhel-7-7-sap-ha, rhel-7-9-sap-ha ‡ RHEL 8: rhel-8, rhel-8-4-sap-ha, rhel-8-6-sap-ha, rhel-8-8-sap-ha ‡ Debian 9 (Stretch) Debian 11 (Bullseye) Deep Learning VM Images based on Debian 11 (Bullseye) Ubuntu LTS 18.04 (Bionic Beaver): ubuntu-1804-lts, ubuntu-minimal-1804-lts Ubuntu LTS 20.04 (Focal Fossa): ubuntu-2004-lts, ubuntu-minimal-2004-lts Ubuntu LTS 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish): buntu-2204-lts, ubuntu-minimal-2204-lts SLES 12: sles-12, sles-12-sp5-sap SLES 15: sles-15, sles-15-sp2-sap, sles-15-sp3-sap, sles-15-sp4-sap, sles-15-sp5-sap, sles-15-sp6-sap OpenSUSE Leap 15: opensuse-leap (opensuse-leap-15-3- , opensuse-leap-15-4- ) Windows Server: 2016, 2019, 2022, Core 2016, Core 2019, Core 2022 † In beta agent policies, the agent columns map to an agent type specified to the gcloud beta compute instances ops-agents policies create invocation: Ops Agent maps to agent type ops-agent .
- You can create a policy for a Google Cloud project that governs existing and new VMs associated with that Google Cloud project, ensuring proper installation and uninstallation of the Ops Agent on those VMs.
- Agent policies enable automated installation and maintenance of the Ops Agent across a fleet of Compute Engine VMs that match user-specified criteria.
- The following example creates a file called config.yaml that contains a policy that matches the label applied in the previous step: cat > config.yaml << EOF agentsRule: packageState: installed version: 2 .47.0 instanceFilter: inclusionLabels: - labels: KEY : VALUE EOF For more information about describing GA agent policies, see Configuration files for agent policies .
