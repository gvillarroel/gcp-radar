- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 46
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- You can install and manage the Ops Agent on a fleet of Compute Engine VMs globally or within a specific zone by using VM Extension Manager policies.
- For example, suppose you created and rolled out a global policy by using the following command: gcloud beta compute global-vm-extension-policies create POLICY NAME \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --extensions=ops-agent \ --version=ops-agent=2.61.0 \ --rollout-predefined-plan=slow rollout \ --config-from-file=ops-agent="/usr/ops-agent-config.yaml" To extend the policy to VMs created in previously unused zones, restart the rollout by using the following command: gcloud beta compute global-vm-extension-policies update test-policy POLICY NAME \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --extensions=ops-agent \ --version=ops-agent=2.61.0 \ --rollout-predefined-plan=slow rollout \ --config-from-file=ops-agent="/usr/ops-agent-config.yaml" \ --rollout-retry-uuid= UUID Replace the following variables in the command: POLICY NAME : A name for the VM extension policy.
- Troubleshoot extension policies This section provides information about troubleshooting the use of extension policies to manage the Ops Agent: gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies commands fail The extension policy is created, but the Ops Agent status is "not detected" Linux systemctl and Windows Service Manager don't work with the Ops Agent For information about troubleshooting the Ops Agent, see Troubleshoot the Ops Agent . gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies commands fail When a gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies command fails, the response includes troubleshooting suggestions.
- Install the Ops Agent with a fast rollout plan at higher priority (global only) To create a global policy that installs the latest version of the Ops Agent on by using a higher-than-default priority and the fast-rollout plan , use the following gcloud beta compute global-vm-extension-policies create command: gcloud beta compute global-vm-extension-policies create POLICY NAME \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --extensions=ops-agent \ --rollout-predefined-plan=fast rollout \ --priority=500 Replace the following variables in the command: POLICY NAME : A name for the VM extension policy.

- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 42
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For new policies, we recommend that you use VM Extension Manager policies for fleet-wide installation and management of the Ops Agent.
- Phase 2: Update that policy to target VMs in a single zone that have the labels env=prod and app=myproduct . gcloud beta compute instances \ ops-agents policies update ops-agents-policy-safe-rollout \ --group-labels=env=prod,app=myproduct \ --zones=us-central1-c \ Phase 3: Update that policy to clear the zones filter so it rolls out globally gcloud beta compute instances \ ops-agents policies update ops-agents-policy-safe-rollout \ --clear-zones Policies on VMs that predate OS Config You might need to manually install and configure the OS Config agent on VMs that predate OS Config.
- Agent policies use the VM Manager suite of tools in Compute Engine to manage OS policies , which can automate the deployment and maintenance of software configurations like the Google Cloud Observability agents: the Ops Agent, the legacy Monitoring agent, and the legacy Logging agent.
- With VM extension policies, you can provide and manage custom configuration for the Ops Agent and manage version control, including auto-upgrades and version pinning.

- To disable self-log collection, add a global section to your user-specified configuration file and set the default self log file collection option to the value false : logging: ... metrics: ... global: default self log file collection: false Log-rotation configuration Starting with Ops Agent version 2.31.0, you can also set up the agent's log-rotation feature by using the configuration files.
- This can be used to remove placeholder values, such as: httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : httpRequest.referer = "-" Sample Configurations The parse json processor would transform a JSON file containing { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } into a LogEntry structure that looks like this: { "jsonPayload" : { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } } This could then be transformed with modify fields into this LogEntry : { "httpRequest" : { "status" : 400 , "requestUrl" : "/index.html" , } } by using this Ops Agent configuration: logging : receivers : in : type : files include paths : - /var/log/http.json processors : parse json : type : parse json set http request : type : modify fields fields : httpRequest.status : move from : jsonPayload.http status type : integer httpRequest.requestUrl : move from : jsonPayload.path httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : jsonPayload.referer = "-" service : pipelines : pipeline : receivers : [ in ] processors : [ parse json , set http request ] This configuration reads JSON-formatted logs from /var/log/http.json and populates part of the httpRequest structure from fields in the logs.
