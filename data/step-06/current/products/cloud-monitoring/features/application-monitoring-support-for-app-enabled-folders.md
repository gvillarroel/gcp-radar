Evidence snippets:
- List applications To list the applications you have registered with App Hub, along with information like the number of incidents and the application's location, criticality, and environment, do the following: In the Google Cloud console, go to the Application monitoring page: Go to Application monitoring If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Monitoring .
- The following screenshot illustrates the dashboard for a workload: The registration status of a service or workload affects what data Application Monitoring displays on the dashboard for the service or workload: Registered : Application Monitoring uses the application-specific labels and attributes that supported infrastructure and instrumented applications attach to the telemetry they generate.
- Investigate an application To investigate the health of an application, do the following: In the Google Cloud console, go to the Application monitoring page: Go to Application monitoring If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Monitoring .
- To open the Application Monitoring dashboard for a service or workload, do the following: In the Google Cloud console, go to the Application monitoring page: Go to Application monitoring If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Monitoring .

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Configure the metrics scope Make sure that the metrics scope for your App Hub host project or management project lists all projects that store your application's metric data: For app-enabled folders, Google Cloud Observability attempts to synchronize the list of projects in your app-enabled folder with the list of projects in the metrics scope.
- Only configure scopes To get the permissions that you need to configure the observability scope, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: Observability Editor ( roles/observability.editor ) on your App Hub host project or management project Logs Configuration Writer ( roles/logging.configWriter ) on your App Hub host project or management project Monitoring admin ( roles/monitoring.admin ) on your App Hub host project or management project and on each project that you want to add to the metrics scope Cloud Trace User ( roles/cloudtrace.user ) on your App Hub host project or management project App Hub viewer ( roles/apphub.viewer ) on your App Hub host project or management project For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- If you are using an app-enabled folder and if you don't have an organization-level aggregated sink or nested folders, then we recommend following: Create an intercepting aggregated sink for your app-enabled folder , and route those logs to the Default log bucket of the management project for your app-enabled folder.
- These labels identify your application and your service or workload: apphub application location apphub application id apphub service id or apphub workload id You can also add user labels to an alerting policy by using the Google Cloud CLI, Terraform, or the Cloud Monitoring API.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 112
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The googlemanagedprometheus exporter converts the http.server.request.duration OpenTelemetry metric into a Prometheus metric that has the following properties: Name: prometheus/http server request duration seconds/histogram Metric: prometheus.googleapis.com/http server request duration seconds/histogram Resource types: prometheus target Unit: s Kind: CUMULATIVE Value type: DISTRIBUTION When your Google Cloud project contains the http server request duration seconds metric, then your Application Monitoring dashboards display the traffic level, server error rate and the latency for HTTP requests.
- Verify metric labels To verify that your application is sending Prometheus metrics, to your project, do the following: Verify that your application is sending Prometheus metrics to your project: In the Google Cloud console, go to the leaderboard Metrics explorer page: Go to Metrics explorer If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Monitoring .
- It also describes how to have your application export a metric that is used by Application Monitoring to report the traffic level, server error rate, or the latency for HTTP requests workloads that run on Google Kubernetes Engine.
- If you run workloads on Google Kubernetes Engine, then this approach exports the HTTP server metric that Application Monitoring uses to generate values for the traffic level, server error rate, and the latency for HTTP requests.
