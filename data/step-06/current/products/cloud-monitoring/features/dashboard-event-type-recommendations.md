### View and manage metric usage \_|\_ Cloud Monitoring \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/metrics-management](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/metrics-management)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 123
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For each metric, the table displays that metric's contribution to billable volume and provides links to to the alerting policies and custom dashboards associated with the metric, as shown in the following screenshot.
- For more information on the types of values a metric might write, see Value type .
- Both the frequency with which the metric is written—the sampling rate —and the type of data the metric writes—scalars or distributions—affect the amount of data ingested, regardless of whether ingestion is charged by bytes ingested or samples ingested. "Bytes ingested" means that charges are based on the volume of data ingested, measured in bytes.
- For example, to list active metrics that appear in no alerting policies and in no custom dashboards, add the following filters to the filter bar: Status: Active Alert Policies: (Empty) Custom Dashboards: (Empty) By default, when you add multiple filters, the table includes a row when the row meets all filters.

- For workloads, the dashboard also displays event annotations , which can help you correlate data from different sources when you are troubleshooting an issue.
- For each supported App Hub region , this page lists at most 100 discovered services and 100 discovered workloads: The App Hub Type column displays the App Hub registration type : Service ( ) Workload ( ) The Functional Type column displays the App Hub functional type : Agent ( robot 2 ) MCP server ( ) From the Services and Workloads tab, you can do all of the following: Modify the data the table displays by using the view column Columns button.
- The following screenshot illustrates the dashboard for a workload: The registration status of a service or workload affects what data Application Monitoring displays on the dashboard for the service or workload: Registered : Application Monitoring uses the application-specific labels and attributes that supported infrastructure and instrumented applications attach to the telemetry they generate.
- To open the flyout that displays both metric and log data, do one of the following: To filter log data only by the resource type and applicable variables, in the chart's toolbar, click more vert More chart options , and then select Inspect related logs .
