Evidence snippets:
- For example, to list active metrics that appear in no alerting policies and in no custom dashboards, add the following filters to the filter bar: Status: Active Alert Policies: (Empty) Custom Dashboards: (Empty) By default, when you add multiple filters, the table includes a row when the row meets all filters.
- For each metric, the table displays that metric's contribution to billable volume and provides links to to the alerting policies and custom dashboards associated with the metric, as shown in the following screenshot.
- Note: The Metrics Management page lists only alerting policies and custom dashboards defined in the current project; metrics listed with no alerting policies or custom dashboards might have alerting policies or custom dashboards in another project in your metrics scope.
- The following table includes regular expressions that might be useful for excluding metrics from statsd or similar dynamically named metrics: Block metrics with names containing Regex more than one underscore in a row . {2,}. more than 7 digits in a row (likely timestamp) . \d{7,}. really long segments (likely label-parsing errors) . [a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}. hexadecimal substrings, including GUIDs . [A-F0-9]{10,}.
