Evidence snippets:
- In your working directory, create the file main.py and add the following contents: import os import json from google.auth.transport import requests from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials from google auth oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow def authorize () - > Credentials : """Ensure valid credentials for calling the Meet REST API.""" CLIENT SECRET FILE = "./client secret.json" credentials = None if os . path . exists ( 'token.json' ): credentials = Credentials . from authorized user file ( 'token.json' ) if credentials is None : flow = InstalledAppFlow . from client secrets file ( CLIENT SECRET FILE , scopes = [ 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.created' , ]) flow . run local server ( port = 0 ) credentials = flow . credentials if credentials and credentials . expired : credentials . refresh ( requests .
- Enable the Google Meet REST API, the Google Workspace Events API, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub with the gcloud services enable command: gcloud services enable meet.googleapis.com workspaceevents.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com Install the Meet REST API client library Follow these steps to install the Meet REST API client library: Run the command: pip install google-apps-meet Edit the main.py file to import the client: from google.apps import meet v2 as meet Create a space Now that the Meet REST API is available, define a function to create a meeting space that can be subscribed to.
- Linux/macOS mkdir meet-tutorial cd meet-tutorial python3 -mvenv env source env/bin/activate Windows (command prompt) mkdir meet-tutorial cd meet-tutorial python3 -mvenv env env/bin/activate.bat Windows (PowerShell) mkdir meet-tutorial cd meet-tutorial python3 -mvenv env env/bin/activate.ps1 Create a Google Cloud project Google API Console In the Google API Console, go to Menu menu IAM & Admin Create a Project .
- The app prompts for authorization and creates a token.json file in the project working directory after the request is approved. python3 main.py Add the Meet REST API Now that the authorization code is complete, it's time to enable and call the Meet REST API.

Evidence snippets:
- OAuth scopes for settings Setting or accessing meetings settings requires the following OAuth scopes: Use case Scope code Set auto artifact generation for spaces created by other apps. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.settings Get or list artifacts from conferences created by other apps. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.readonly Get or list other pre-meeting settings of a meeting space created by a third-party app. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.created https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.readonly Read and edit the settings for all meeting spaces a user can access through any other app, such as Calendar. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.settings For more information on OAuth scopes, see Meet REST API scopes .
- Each method takes a path parameter with the create and list methods using the parent field to denote the meeting space, and the delete and get methods using the name field to filter the results based on the meeting space and the member name.
- When the moderation mode is on , the meeting organizer has control over the meeting with features such as co-host management (see spaces.members ) and feature restrictions using the moderationRestrictions field.
- When both features are enabled While each feature can be used separately, both transcripts and smart notes can also be used at the same time to create better post-meeting artifacts.
