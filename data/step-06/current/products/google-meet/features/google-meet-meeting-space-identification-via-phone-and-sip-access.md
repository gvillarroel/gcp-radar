# Google Meet meeting space identification via phone and SIP access

Product: Google Meet
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

Developers can identify and join a meeting space using the phoneAccess and gatewaySipAccess fields on the spaces resource.

## Extended Definition

Developers can identify and join a meeting space using the phoneAccess and gatewaySipAccess fields on the spaces resource.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

Evidence snippets:
- OAuth scopes for settings Setting or accessing meetings settings requires the following OAuth scopes: Use case Scope code Set auto artifact generation for spaces created by other apps. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.settings Get or list artifacts from conferences created by other apps. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.readonly Get or list other pre-meeting settings of a meeting space created by a third-party app. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.created https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.readonly Read and edit the settings for all meeting spaces a user can access through any other app, such as Calendar. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.settings For more information on OAuth scopes, see Meet REST API scopes .
- Each method takes a path parameter with the create and list methods using the parent field to denote the meeting space, and the delete and get methods using the name field to filter the results based on the meeting space and the member name.
- Set moderation and meeting access You can set how users join a meeting, the moderation modes, the feature restrictions, and the permissions users receive when they join a meeting, through the SpaceConfig object.
- When the moderation mode is on , the meeting organizer has control over the meeting with features such as co-host management (see spaces.members ) and feature restrictions using the moderationRestrictions field.
