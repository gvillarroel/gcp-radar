Evidence snippets:
- You can configure startup instructions by adding entrypoint to app.yaml. app . run ( host = "127.0.0.1" , port = 8080 , debug = True ) Quotas and limits App Engine automatically allocates resources to your application as traffic increases.
- The Google Cloud console Quota Details page also reports Secure Requests , Secure Incoming Bandwidth , and Secure Outgoing Bandwidth as separate values for informational purposes.
- Users may also experience increased latency because of requests waiting in the pending queue for available instances.
- App Engine pending queue prioritization During periods of heavy traffic, App Engine might place requests in a pending queue while waiting for an available instance with the following prioritization: App Engine prioritizes other queued requests over pending queued requests from Task queue .

Evidence snippets:
- Manage your connector Controlling egress traffic from a service By default, only requests to internal IP addresses and internal DNS names are routed through a Serverless VPC Access connector.
- Note that routing all outbound requests to your VPC network increases the amount of egress handled by the Serverless VPC Access connector and can incur charges .
- Using the urlfetch library ignores egress settings, and requests will not route through a Serverless VPC Access connector.
- Test the custom constraint To test the example that restricts ingress settings, deploy a connector in the project with network set to default : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create org-policy-test \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION ID \ --network = default The output is the following: Operation denied by custom org policies: ["customConstraints/custom.defaultNetworkConstraint": "Require network to not be set to default."] Example custom organization policies for common use cases The following table provides examples of custom constraints that you might find useful with Serverless VPC Access connectors: Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors can only use a specific network. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.allowlistNetworks resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.network == 'allowlisted-network'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : allowlistNetworks description : Require connectors to use a specific network.

Evidence snippets:
- Apps with basic scaling If you use basic scaling, App Engine attempts to keep your cost low, even though that may result in higher latency as the volume of incoming requests increases.
- As requests for your application increase, the number of dynamic instances may increase as well.
- Scaling types App Engine supports the following scaling types , which controls how and when instances are created: Automatic (default) Basic Manual You specify the scaling type in your app's app.yaml .
- Scaling dynamic instances App Engine applications that use basic or automatic scaling are powered by any number of dynamic instances at a given time, depending on the volume of incoming requests.
