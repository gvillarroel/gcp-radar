- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 68
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
- Enforce a custom constraint You can enforce a constraint by creating an organization policy that references it, and then applying that organization policy to a Google Cloud resource.
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- Create a connector using an existing subnet : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create CONNECTOR NAME \ --region REGION \ --subnet SUBNET NAME \ --subnet-project HOST PROJECT ID \ --min-instances MIN \ --max-instances MAX \ --machine-type MACHINE TYPE Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : a name for your connector, matching Compute Engine naming conventions , with the additional requirements that the name must be less than 21 characters long, and that hyphens (-) count as two characters.

Evidence snippets:
- Before you begin Before you can create App Engine firewall rules for your app, you must have one of the following App Engine IAM roles , which include the necessary privileges for creating or modifying firewall rules: App Engine Admin Editor Owner Creating firewall rules Use one of the following methods to create a firewall rule.
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Creating App Engine firewall rules Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- Examples: Use the following examples to help you create your firewall: Add a rule that allows an IPv6 address and subnet mask, and then test that rule to ensure it gets evaluated prior to your other rules: gcloud app firewall-rules create 123 --source-range fe80::3636:3bff:fecc:8778/128 --action allow gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip fe80::3636:3bff:fecc:8778 Add a rule to deny an IPv4 address and subnet mask, and then test that rule to ensure that it gets appropriately evaluated: gcloud app firewall-rules create 123456 --source-range "74.125.0.0/16" --action deny gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip 74 .125.0.8 Update and then test the default rule to ensure that it restricts all IP addresses that don't match any other rules: gcloud app firewall-rules update default --action deny gcloud app firewall-rules test-ip 123 .456.7.89 API To programmatically create firewall rules for your App Engine app, you can use the apps.firewall.ingressRules methods in the Admin API.
- Understanding App Engine firewall rules An App Engine firewall consists of an ordered list of rules that can allow or deny access from the specified IP address or range to your app.

- Final score: 51
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Service projects Advantages of creating connectors in the service projects: Isolation: Each connector has dedicated bandwidth and is unaffected by bandwidth use of connectors in other service projects.
- A user with the Compute Engine Security Admin role or a custom Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the compute.firewalls.create permission enabled for the host project must still manage firewall rules for the connector.
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Connecting to a Shared VPC network Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- This allows a standard environment service to access resources in your Shared VPC network, such as Compute Engine VM instances, Memorystore instances, and any other resources with an internal IP address.
