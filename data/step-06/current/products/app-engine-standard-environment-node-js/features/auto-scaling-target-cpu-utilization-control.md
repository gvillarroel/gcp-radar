Evidence snippets:
- The name of the new subnet begins with the "aet-" prefix. (Optional) To set scaling options for additional control over the connector, click Show Scaling Settings to display the scaling form.
- Test the custom constraint To test the example that restricts ingress settings, deploy a connector in the project with network set to default : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create org-policy-test \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION ID \ --network = default The output is the following: Operation denied by custom org policies: ["customConstraints/custom.defaultNetworkConstraint": "Require network to not be set to default."] Example custom organization policies for common use cases The following table provides examples of custom constraints that you might find useful with Serverless VPC Access connectors: Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors can only use a specific network. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.allowlistNetworks resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.network == 'allowlisted-network'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : allowlistNetworks description : Require connectors to use a specific network.
- Don't change the specified ports. gcloud compute firewall-rules create serverless-to-vpc-connector \ --allow tcp:667,udp:665-666,icmp \ --source-ranges = 35 .199.224.0/19 \ --direction = INGRESS \ --target-tags vpc-connector \ --network = VPC NETWORK gcloud compute firewall-rules create vpc-connector-to-serverless \ --allow tcp:667,udp:665-666,icmp \ --destination-ranges = 35 .199.224.0/19 \ --direction = EGRESS \ --target-tags vpc-connector \ --network = VPC NETWORK gcloud compute firewall-rules create vpc-connector-health-checks \ --allow tcp:667 \ --source-ranges = 35 .191.0.0/16,35.191.192.0/18,130.211.0.0/22 \ --direction = INGRESS \ --target-tags vpc-connector \ --network = VPC NETWORK Replace VPC NETWORK with the name of the VPC network to attach your connector to.
- Find the current attribute values To find the current attribute values for your connector, run the following in your terminal: gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors describe CONNECTOR NAME --region = REGION --project = PROJECT Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : the name of your connector REGION : the name of your connector's region PROJECT : the name of your Google Cloud project Monitor connector usage Monitoring usage over time can help you determine when to adjust a connector's settings.

Evidence snippets:
- Automatic scaling settings Description Target CPU utilization Sets the CPU utilization ratio threshold to specify the CPU usage threshold at which more instances will be started to handle traffic.
- Scaling types App Engine supports the following scaling types , which controls how and when instances are created: Automatic (default) Basic Manual You specify the scaling type in your app's app.yaml .
- You can configure the settings for automatic scaling to achieve a trade-off between the performance you want and the cost you can incur.
- This scaling factors in the automatic scaling settings that are provided on a per-version basis in the configuration file.

Evidence snippets:
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Setting up access control Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- In App Engine, there are a few separate use cases for setting up access control: Granting team members access to your Google Cloud project so they can set up services and deploy apps.
- This page provides an overview of setting up access control in each use case.
- If you don't assign an app-level default service account, Google Cloud uses the auto-created App Engine default service account ( PROJECT ID @appspot.gserviceaccount.com ).
