Evidence snippets:
- To perform these steps, you must have one of the following roles on the host project: Owner role ( roles/owner ) Compute Security Admin role ( roles/compute.securityAdmin ) Custom Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the compute.firewalls.create permission enabled For a basic configuration, apply the rules to allow serverless resources in any service project connected to the Shared VPC network to send requests to any resource in the network.
- You must have one of the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles: Compute Security Admin role Custom IAM role with the compute.firewalls.create permission enabled Deny connector traffic across your VPC network.

Evidence snippets:
- Example URLs Here are some examples of URLs for App Engine, showing both the appspot.com domain that App Engine assigns to your app and a custom domain, which you can set up for your app .
- REGION ID .r.appspot.com https:// CUSTOM DOMAIN Requests are received by any version that is configured for traffic in the default service.
- CUSTOM DOMAIN If you are using manually-scaled services , you can target and send a request to a instance by including the instance ID.
- Soft routing does not apply to custom domains; requests to them will return a HTTP 404 status code if the hostname is invalid.

Evidence snippets:
- Identity Platform Identity Platform is a customer identity and access management (CIAM) platform that lets organizations customize identity and authentication for user sign-up and sign-in in their applications.
- This solution is best if you want to authenticate users based on their Google Account, or if you are using Google Admin console for your domain.
- Similar to Identity Platform, Firebase Authentication supports multiple authentication methods (SAML, OIDC, email/password, social, mobile, and custom auth) to provide flexible integration options for any identity solution.
