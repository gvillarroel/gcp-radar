Evidence snippets:
- Go to Google Cloud console dashboard In the menu bar at the top of the dashboard, click the project dropdown menu and select the host project. gcloud Set the default project in the gcloud CLI to the host project by running the following in your terminal: gcloud config set project HOST PROJECT ID Replace the following: HOST PROJECT ID : the ID of the Shared VPC host project Create a Serverless VPC Access connector To send requests to your VPC network and receive the corresponding responses, you must create a Serverless VPC Access connector.
- Add the vpc access connector to your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector: name: projects/ HOST PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME Replace the following: HOST PROJECT ID : the ID of the Shared VPC host project REGION : the region of your connector CONNECTOR NAME : the name of your connector Deploy the service: gcloud app deploy After deploying, your service is able to send requests to your Shared VPC network and receive the corresponding responses.
- Click Save . gcloud Run the following in your terminal: gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding HOST PROJECT ID \ --member= PRINCIPAL \ --role=roles/vpcaccess.user Replace the following: HOST PROJECT ID : the ID of the Shared VPC host project PRINCIPAL : the principal that deploys your App Engine service.
- Click Save . gcloud Run the following in your terminal: gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding HOST PROJECT ID \ --member= PRINCIPAL \ --role=roles/vpcaccess.viewer Replace the following: HOST PROJECT ID : the ID of the Shared VPC host project PRINCIPAL : the principal who deploys App Engine services.

Evidence snippets:
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- For Shared VPC users who set up connectors in the Shared VPC host project, you can use the command gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors describe to list the projects in which there are serverless resources that use a given connector.

Evidence snippets:
- Accessing internal services The following considerations apply: For requests from a Shared VPC, traffic is only considered internal if the App Engine app is deployed in the Shared VPC host project.
- Shared VPC when the App Engine app is deployed in the Shared VPC host project.
- For requests from other App Engine services or from Cloud Run or Cloud Run functions in the same project, connect the service or function to a VPC network and route all egress through the connector, as described in Connecting to a Shared VPC network .
- Note that routing all outbound requests to your VPC network increases the amount of egress handled by the Serverless VPC Access connector and can incur charges .
