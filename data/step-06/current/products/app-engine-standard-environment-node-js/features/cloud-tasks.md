Evidence snippets:
- When a service receives standard HTTP traffic at high volume while also serving Task queue or Cloud Tasks traffic at much lower volume, there is a disproportionate impact on the latency of the Task queue or the Cloud Tasks traffic.
- App Engine pending queue prioritization During periods of heavy traffic, App Engine might place requests in a pending queue while waiting for an available instance with the following prioritization: App Engine prioritizes other queued requests over pending queued requests from Task queue .
- You should also consider serving latency sensitive requests from Cloud Tasks with a dedicated major version or service.
- Requests from App Engine Cloud Tasks also share this pending queue priority behavior for compatibility reasons.

- Create App Engine tasks in the form of an HTTP request and then place them in Cloud Tasks queues, see Create App Engine tasks .
- To run asynchronous tasks, you can: Create Cloud Tasks queues, see Create Cloud Tasks queues .
- For a more detailed overview, see Understand Cloud Tasks in the Cloud Tasks documentation.
- You can use the Cloud Tasks client library to run tasks in App Engine.

Evidence snippets:
- The following limits apply to task queues according to their type: Push Queue Limits Maximum task size 100KB Queue execution rate 500 task invocations per second per queue Maximum countdown/ETA for a task 30 days from the current date and time Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a batch 100 tasks Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a transaction 5 tasks Default maximum number of task queues 100 queues.
- Task Queue When a task executes, its associated requests count toward the application request quotas These limits apply to all task queues: Resource Daily limit Maximum rate Task Queue management calls (using the Google Cloud console) 10,000 n/a Resource Default limit Maximum number of queues (includes both push and pull queues but not the default queue) 100 queues.
