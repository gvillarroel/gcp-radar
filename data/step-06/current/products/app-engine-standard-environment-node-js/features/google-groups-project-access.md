Evidence snippets:
- In App Engine, there are a few separate use cases for setting up access control: Granting team members access to your Google Cloud project so they can set up services and deploy apps.
- Granting access to team members To give a developer access to your Google Cloud project, create one or both of the following: A user account , which is associated with a Google account and is intended to represent a specific individual on your project.
- Granting your app access to Cloud services Every call to a Cloud service needs to be authenticated and authorized, including calls from an App Engine app to other Cloud services such as Cloud Storage.
- Granting your users access to resources in a Google Cloud project.

Evidence snippets:
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- Create a connector using an existing subnet : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create CONNECTOR NAME \ --region REGION \ --subnet SUBNET NAME \ --subnet-project HOST PROJECT ID \ --min-instances MIN \ --max-instances MAX \ --machine-type MACHINE TYPE Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : a name for your connector, matching Compute Engine naming conventions , with the additional requirements that the name must be less than 21 characters long, and that hyphens (-) count as two characters.
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
- Grant your project permission to use Compute Engine VM images from the project with ID serverless-vpc-access-images .

Evidence snippets:
- App Engine firewall The App Engine firewall enables you to control access to your App Engine app through a set of rules that can either allow or deny requests from the specified ranges of IP addresses.
- Access control In each Google Cloud project, set up access control to determine who can access the services within the project, including App Engine.
- You can then create and modify your firewall rules to control the scope of access throughout your release process, allowing only certain organizations, either within your company or externally, to access your app as it makes its way to public availability.
- REGION ID .r.appspot.com To target specific resources in your App Engine app, use the -dot- syntax to separate each resource you want to target, for example: https:// VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT ID .
