Evidence snippets:
- Update gcloud components to the latest version: gcloud components update Ensure that the Serverless VPC Access API is enabled for your project: gcloud services enable vpcaccess.googleapis.com Create the connector using one of the following options: For more details and optional arguments, see the gcloud reference .
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.

- To increase the minimum or maximum number of instances for the connector, run the following command in your terminal: gcloud beta compute networks vpc-access connectors update CONNECTOR NAME --region = REGION --min-instances = MIN INSTANCES --max-instances = MAX INSTANCES Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : the name of your connector REGION : the name of your connector's region MIN INSTANCES : your preferred minimum number of instances.
