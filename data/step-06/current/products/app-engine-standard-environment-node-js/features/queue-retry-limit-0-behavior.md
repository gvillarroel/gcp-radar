- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- This table compares the performance features of the three scaling types: Feature Automatic scaling Basic scaling Manual scaling Request timeout 10 minutes for HTTP requests and task queue tasks.
- Before the queues become long enough to have a noticeable effect on your app's latency, App Engine automatically creates one or more new instances to handle the increasing load.
- 24 hours for HTTP requests and task queue tasks.
- One of the benefits App Engine standard environment's "pay for only what you need" platform as described earlier in Scaling Down is that the system autoscales the number of instances down to zero when there is no traffic.

Evidence snippets:
- Requests from App Engine Cloud Tasks also share this pending queue priority behavior for compatibility reasons.
- When a service receives standard HTTP traffic at high volume while also serving Task queue or Cloud Tasks traffic at much lower volume, there is a disproportionate impact on the latency of the Task queue or the Cloud Tasks traffic.
- Within the pending queue, App Engine treats requests from HTTP target Cloud Tasks as regular HTTP traffic.
- The following limits apply specifically to the use of request handlers: Limit Amount Request size 32 megabytes Response size 32 megabytes Request timeout Depends on the type of scaling your app uses Maximum total number of files (app files and static files) 10,000 total 1,000 per directory Maximum size of an application file 32 megabytes Maximum size of a static file 32 megabytes Maximum total size of all application and static files First 1 gigabyte is free $ 0.026 per gigabyte per month after first 1 gigabyte Pending request timeout 10 seconds Maximum size of a single request header field 8 kilobytes for second-generation runtimes in the standard environment.
