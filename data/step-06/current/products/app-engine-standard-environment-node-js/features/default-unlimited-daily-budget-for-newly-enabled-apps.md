Evidence snippets:
- Data Access audit logs are disabled by default and aren't written unless explicitly enabled (the exception is Data Access audit logs for BigQuery, which can't be disabled).
- The following are the audit log names, including variables for the resource identifiers: projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata access projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem event projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fpolicy folders/ FOLDER ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity folders/ FOLDER ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata access folders/ FOLDER ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem event folders/ FOLDER ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fpolicy billingAccounts/ BILLING ACCOUNT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity billingAccounts/ BILLING ACCOUNT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata access billingAccounts/ BILLING ACCOUNT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem event billingAccounts/ BILLING ACCOUNT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fpolicy organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata access organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem event organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fpolicy Note: The part of the log name following /logs/ must be URL-encoded.
- Audited operations The following table summarizes which API operations correspond to each audit log type in App Engine: Audit logs category App Engine operations Admin Activity audit logs apps.create apps.patch apps.repair apps.authorizedCertificates.create apps.authorizedCertificates.delete apps.authorizedCertificates.patch apps.domainMappings.create apps.domainMappings.delete apps.domainMappings.patch apps.firewall.ingressRules.batchUpdate apps.firewall.ingressRules.create apps.firewall.ingressRules.delete apps.firewall.ingressRules.patch apps.services.delete apps.services.patch apps.services.versions.create apps.services.versions.delete apps.services.versions.patch apps.services.versions.instances.debug apps.services.versions.instances.delete Data Access audit logs GetMemcacheItem SetMemcacheItem DeleteMemcacheItem FlushAllMemcacheItems Memcache audit logs only apply to operations made through Cloud Console.
- To read your Google Cloud project-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --project= PROJECT ID To read your folder-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : folders/ FOLDER ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --folder= FOLDER ID To read your organization-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --organization= ORGANIZATION ID To read your Cloud Billing account-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : billingAccounts/ BILLING ACCOUNT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --billing-account= BILLING ACCOUNT ID Add the --freshness flag to your command to read logs that are more than 1 day old.

Evidence snippets:
- Each App Engine application includes at least one service, the default service, which can hold many versions, depending on your app's billing status.
- For example, an app that handles your customer requests might include separate services that each handle different tasks, such as: API requests from mobile devices Internal, administration-type requests Backend processing such as billing pipelines and data analysis Each service in App Engine consists of the source code from your app and the corresponding App Engine configuration files.
- You can choose from several popular languages to develop your apps, and then let App Engine take care of provisioning servers and scaling your app instances based on demand.
- Services Use services in App Engine to factor your large apps into logical components that can securely share App Engine features and communicate with one another.
