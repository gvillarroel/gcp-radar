- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 159
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- For example: To update the default service of an App Engine app to accept traffic only from Cloud Load Balancing and VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update default --ingress = internal-and-cloud-load-balancing To update a service named "internal-requests" to accept traffic only from VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update internal-requests --ingress = internal-only Egress settings Note: Egress settings are not available for the PHP runtimes.
- Internal and Cloud Load Balancing Allows requests from the following resources: Resources allowed by the more restrictive Internal setting External Application Load Balancer Use the Internal and Cloud Load Balancing setting to accept requests from an external Application Load Balancer but not directly from the internet.
- For each service, the value in this column shows the ingress setting as one of All (default), Internal + Load Balancing , or Internal . gcloud To view the ingress setting for a service using the gcloud CLI: gcloud app services describe SERVICE Replace SERVICE with the name of your service.
- Note that routing all outbound requests to your VPC network increases the amount of egress handled by the Serverless VPC Access connector and can incur charges .

### "How requests are routed \_|\_ App Engine standard environment \_|\_ Google\

- Final score: 143
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- For example, you can create a dispatch file to route mobile requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/mobile/ to a mobile frontend, and route worker requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/work/ to a static backend: dispatch: Send all mobile traffic to the mobile frontend. - url: " /mobile/ " service: mobile-frontend Send all work to the one static backend. - url: " /work/ " service: static-backend Deploying the dispatch file To deploy the dispatch file using gcloud, run the following command: gcloud app deploy dispatch.yaml Routing with Cloud Load Balancing Cloud Load Balancing is a separate product that enables advanced network configurations for all of your applications running on Google Cloud.
- When HTTP(S) Load Balancing is enabled for serverless apps , you can: Configure your serverless app to serve from a dedicated IPv4 or IPv6 IP address that is not shared with other services.
- Requests that don't pass through Cloud Load Balancing are never intercepted and rerouted by the patterns that you have defined in your dispatch file: Sends the request to an available instance of a specific service and version: https:// VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT ID .
- When routing requests that are mapped to an App Engine serverless NEG, the load balancer only consults dispatch rules if the serverless NEG doesn't specify a service or version.

### "Communicating between your services \_|\_ App Engine standard environment\

- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Route the traffic over a Serverless VPC Access connector : For each App Engine version sending private traffic to other app endpoints, attach the version to a Serverless VPC Access connector belonging to one of the Google Cloud project's own networks, not a Shared VPC network.
- In the standard environment, attach each client version to a Serverless VPC Access connector on the Shared VPC network.
- Communication between services in different projects You can have private access between Google Cloud projects when apps running in projects belong to a Shared VPC network that is configured to invoke an app running in the Shared VPC network's host project.
- Note: The "internal" traffic setting blocks all traffic from additional Google Cloud services that do not use the VPC network, such as URLFetch, Cloud Tasks, and Pub/Sub, even within the same project.
