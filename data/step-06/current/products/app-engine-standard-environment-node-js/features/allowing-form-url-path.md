- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- When you have entered a value into each field, the equivalent YAML configuration for this custom constraint appears on the right. gcloud To create a custom constraint, create a YAML file using the following format: name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/ CONSTRAINT NAME resourceTypes : RESOURCE NAME methodTypes : - CREATE condition : " CONDITION " actionType : ACTION displayName : DISPLAY NAME description : DESCRIPTION Replace the following: ORGANIZATION ID : your organization ID, such as 123456789 .
- Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors have access to only a specific subnet. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.restrictSubnetForProject resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.subnet.name == 'allocated-subnet'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : restrictSubnetForProject description : This project is only allowed to use the subnet "allocated-subnet".

- One of the benefits App Engine standard environment's "pay for only what you need" platform as described earlier in Scaling Down is that the system autoscales the number of instances down to zero when there is no traffic.
- Scaling dynamic instances App Engine applications that use basic or automatic scaling are powered by any number of dynamic instances at a given time, depending on the volume of incoming requests.
- This table compares the performance features of the three scaling types: Feature Automatic scaling Basic scaling Manual scaling Request timeout 10 minutes for HTTP requests and task queue tasks.
