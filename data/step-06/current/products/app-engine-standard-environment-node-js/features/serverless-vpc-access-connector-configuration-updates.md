- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Comparison of configuration methods For Shared VPC, Serverless VPC Access connectors can be configured in two different ways.
- A user with the Compute Engine Security Admin role or a custom Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the compute.firewalls.create permission enabled for the host project must still manage firewall rules for the connector.
- If your organization uses Shared VPC , you can connect App Engine standard environment services directly to your Shared VPC network by using Serverless VPC Access .
- Serverless VPC Access connectors incur a monthly charge.

Evidence snippets:
- Route the traffic over a Serverless VPC Access connector : For each App Engine version sending private traffic to other app endpoints, attach the version to a Serverless VPC Access connector belonging to one of the Google Cloud project's own networks, not a Shared VPC network.
- Configure the client app to send all-traffic through the Serverless VPC Access connector, instead of configuring requests to use the private.googleapis.com IP range.
- In the standard environment, attach each client version to a Serverless VPC Access connector on the Shared VPC network.
- Ensure Private Google Access is enabled for the subnet used by the Serverless VPC Access connector.

Evidence snippets:
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- Test the custom constraint To test the example that restricts ingress settings, deploy a connector in the project with network set to default : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create org-policy-test \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION ID \ --network = default The output is the following: Operation denied by custom org policies: ["customConstraints/custom.defaultNetworkConstraint": "Require network to not be set to default."] Example custom organization policies for common use cases The following table provides examples of custom constraints that you might find useful with Serverless VPC Access connectors: Description Constraint syntax Require that Serverless VPC Access connectors can only use a specific network. name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.allowlistNetworks resourceTypes : - vpcaccess.googleapis.com/Connector methodTypes : - CREATE condition : "resource.network == 'allowlisted-network'" actionType : ALLOW displayName : allowlistNetworks description : Require connectors to use a specific network.
- Create a connector using an existing subnet : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create CONNECTOR NAME \ --region REGION \ --subnet SUBNET NAME \ --subnet-project HOST PROJECT ID \ --min-instances MIN \ --max-instances MAX \ --machine-type MACHINE TYPE Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : a name for your connector, matching Compute Engine naming conventions , with the additional requirements that the name must be less than 21 characters long, and that hyphens (-) count as two characters.
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
