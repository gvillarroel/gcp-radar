# App Engine Node.js deployment --no-cache option

Product: App Engine standard environment Node.js
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

The `gcloud beta app deploy --no-cache` option was added to force Node.js dependency installation during deployment by bypassing the build cache.

Evidence snippets:
- You can serve your app's static content directly from that app in App Engine, host your static content on a Google Cloud option like Cloud Storage, or use a third-party content delivery network (CDN).
- You also have the option to use an external or third-party database if that database is supported by your language and accessible from your App Engine instance.
- Similarly, both service2 and service3 are in separate directories, which contain each service's files, although service3 includes two versions of the YAML configuration file: In the following example, a single service has the optional dispatch.yaml file and two configuration files that represent different versions of that service, service1.yaml and service2.yaml : Design considerations for instance uptime Hardware or software failures that cause early termination or frequent instance restarts can occur without warning and can take considerable time to resolve.
- See the following topics for details about each of the optional features: cron.yaml configures regularly scheduled tasks that operate at defined times or regular intervals. dispatch.yaml overrides routing default rules by sending incoming requests to a specific service based on the path or hostname in the URL. index.yaml specifies which indexes your app needs if using Datastore queries.

Evidence snippets:
- Terraform You can use a Terraform resource to enable the vpcaccess.googleapis.com API. resource "google project service" "vpcaccess-api" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes service = "vpcaccess.googleapis.com" } You can use Terraform modules to create a VPC network and subnet and then create the connector. module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-serverless-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "serverless-subnet" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/28" subnet region = "us-central1" } ] } module "serverless-connector" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google//modules/vpc-serverless-connector-beta" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id vpc connectors = [{ name = "central-serverless" region = "us-central1" subnet name = module.test-vpc-module.subnets["us-central1/serverless-subnet"].name host project id = var.host project id # Specify a host project id for shared VPC machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } Uncomment to specify an ip cidr range , { name = "central-serverless2" region = "us-central1" network = module.test-vpc-module.network name ip cidr range = "10.10.11.0/28" subnet name = null machine type = "e2-standard-4" min instances = 2 max instances = 7 } ] depends on = [ google project service.vpcaccess-api ] } Configure your service to use a connector After you have created a Serverless VPC Access connector, you must configure each service in your App Engine app that you want to connect to your VPC network.
- Create a connector using an existing subnet : gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors create CONNECTOR NAME \ --region REGION \ --subnet SUBNET NAME \ --subnet-project HOST PROJECT ID \ --min-instances MIN \ --max-instances MAX \ --machine-type MACHINE TYPE Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : a name for your connector, matching Compute Engine naming conventions , with the additional requirements that the name must be less than 21 characters long, and that hyphens (-) count as two characters.
- To configure the egress behavior of your App Engine service: Add the egress setting attribute to the vpc access connector field of your service's app.yaml file: vpc access connector : name : projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /connectors/ CONNECTOR NAME egress setting : EGRESS SETTING Replace: PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID REGION with the region your connector is in CONNECTOR NAME with the name of your connector EGRESS SETTING with one of the following: private-ranges-only Default.
- However, if you create a connector in a service project and the connector targets a Shared VPC network in the host project, you must add firewall rules to allow necessary traffic for the connector's operation from the following ranges: Serverless infrastructure IP range : 35.199.224.0/19 Health check probe IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 , 35.191.192.0/18 , and 130.211.0.0/22 These ranges are used by the Google infrastructure underlying Cloud Run, Cloud Run functions, and App Engine standard environment.

- Available audit logs The following types of audit logs are available for App Engine: Admin Activity audit logs Includes "admin write" operations that write metadata or configuration information.
