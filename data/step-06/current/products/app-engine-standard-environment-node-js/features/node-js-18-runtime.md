Evidence snippets:
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Node.js Runtime Environment Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- The Node.js runtime for App Engine in the standard environment is declared in the app.yaml file: runtime : nodejs VERSION Where VERSION is the Node.js MAJOR version number.
- NPM build script By default, when you deploy the app in App Engine, the Node.js runtime executes npm run build if a build script is detected in package.json .
- Because minor and patch versions are automatically updated, if present, the engines.node property in your package.json file can only specify the major version and be compatible with the Node.js version specified in your app.yaml file.

- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Generally, your app.yaml file requires only the runtime element for a simple Node.js app in the standard environment, for example: runtime : nodejs24 App Engine provides default values for all other settings, including the F1 instance class , which determines the memory and CPU resources that are available to your app, and automatic scaling , which controls how and when new instances of your app are created.
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Defining runtime settings Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- An App Engine app is configured using an app.yaml file, that contains the runtime, handlers, scaling, and other general settings including environment variables.
- About app.yaml files You can specify the runtime configuration for your Node.js app, including versions and URLs, in the app.yaml file.

Evidence snippets:
- Because several of the legacy runtimes are no longer maintained by their respective open-source communities, as an App Engine developer, you may face hard choices on whether to invest time and effort in migrating to a newer runtime or else incur growing costs to retain your app on a legacy runtime.
- To reduce runtime migration complexity, Google Cloud now supports a set of App Engine legacy bundled services and their associated APIs on second-generation runtimes, which include Python 3 , Java 11+ , Go 1.12+ , and PHP 7+ .

- How apps access the App Engine legacy bundled services In runtime migration scenarios, you often also have the option to use Google Cloud products that offer similar functionality as the legacy bundled services.
