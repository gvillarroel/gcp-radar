Evidence snippets:
- For example, an app that handles your customer requests might include separate services that each handle different tasks, such as: API requests from mobile devices Internal, administration-type requests Backend processing such as billing pipelines and data analysis Each service in App Engine consists of the source code from your app and the corresponding App Engine configuration files.
- When you create your App Engine app, all your resources are created in the region that you choose, including your app code along with a collection of settings, credentials, and your app's metadata.
- Some of the resources used by instances in the App Engine flexible environment, such as disk, CPU, and memory, count towards the Compute Engine API quotas of your project.
- Each App Engine application includes at least one service, the default service, which can hold many versions, depending on your app's billing status.
