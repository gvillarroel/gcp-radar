- The Node.js runtime for App Engine in the standard environment is declared in the app.yaml file: runtime : nodejs VERSION Where VERSION is the Node.js MAJOR version number.
- Environment variables The following environment variables are set by the runtime: Environment variable Description GAE APPLICATION The ID of your App Engine application.
- NPM build script By default, when you deploy the app in App Engine, the Node.js runtime executes npm run build if a build script is detected in package.json .

Evidence snippets:
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Configuring warmup requests to improve performance Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- If warmup requests are enabled for your application, App Engine attempts to detect when your application needs a new instance and initiates a warmup request to initialize a new instance.
- Enabling warmup requests Warmup requests are used by the App Engine scheduler, which controls the auto scaling of instances based on user-supplied configuration.
- When deploying to Google App Engine, a webserver process such as Gunicorn will serve the app.

Evidence snippets:
- Generally, your app.yaml file requires only the runtime element for a simple Node.js app in the standard environment, for example: runtime : nodejs24 App Engine provides default values for all other settings, including the F1 instance class , which determines the memory and CPU resources that are available to your app, and automatic scaling , which controls how and when new instances of your app are created.
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Defining runtime settings Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- An App Engine app is configured using an app.yaml file, that contains the runtime, handlers, scaling, and other general settings including environment variables.
- About app.yaml files You can specify the runtime configuration for your Node.js app, including versions and URLs, in the app.yaml file.
