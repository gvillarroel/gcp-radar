Evidence snippets:
- Scaling dynamic instances App Engine applications that use basic or automatic scaling are powered by any number of dynamic instances at a given time, depending on the volume of incoming requests.
- You can specify thresholds for each of these metrics, as well as a minimum number instances to keep running at all times by configuring the automatic scaling element.
- By default, your app uses automatic scaling, which means App Engine will manage the number of idle instances.
- Scaling App Engine scales the number of instances automatically in response to processing volume.

Evidence snippets:
- The following limits apply specifically to the use of request handlers: Limit Amount Request size 32 megabytes Response size 32 megabytes Request timeout Depends on the type of scaling your app uses Maximum total number of files (app files and static files) 10,000 total 1,000 per directory Maximum size of an application file 32 megabytes Maximum size of a static file 32 megabytes Maximum total size of all application and static files First 1 gigabyte is free $ 0.026 per gigabyte per month after first 1 gigabyte Pending request timeout 10 seconds Maximum size of a single request header field 8 kilobytes for second-generation runtimes in the standard environment.
- The number of instances can be adjusted automatically as traffic changes.
- However, this is bound by the following restrictions: App Engine reserves automatic scaling capacity for applications with low latency, where the application responds to requests in less than one second.
- You can configure startup instructions by adding entrypoint to app.yaml. app . run ( host = "127.0.0.1" , port = 8080 , debug = True ) Quotas and limits App Engine automatically allocates resources to your application as traffic increases.

Evidence snippets:
- To increase the minimum or maximum number of instances for the connector, run the following command in your terminal: gcloud beta compute networks vpc-access connectors update CONNECTOR NAME --region = REGION --min-instances = MIN INSTANCES --max-instances = MAX INSTANCES Replace the following: CONNECTOR NAME : the name of your connector REGION : the name of your connector's region MIN INSTANCES : your preferred minimum number of instances.
- Update a connector You can update and monitor the following attributes of your connector by using the Google Cloud console, Google Cloud CLI, or the API: Machine (instance) type Minimum and maximum number of instances Recent throughput, number of instances, and CPU utilization Update machine type Caution: Changing machine type can cause some long-running connections to drop.
- To display charts for the connector's throughput, number of instances, and CPU utilization metrics over time by using the Google Cloud console: Go to the Serverless VPC Access overview page.
- Conversely, if you only want to update the maximum number of instances but not the minimum, you must still specify the minimum number of instances.
