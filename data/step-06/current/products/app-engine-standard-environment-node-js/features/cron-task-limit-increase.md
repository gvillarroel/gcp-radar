- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- This table compares the performance features of the three scaling types: Feature Automatic scaling Basic scaling Manual scaling Request timeout 10 minutes for HTTP requests and task queue tasks.
- Scaling and batches of requests If you are sending batches of requests to your services, for example, to a task queue for processing, a large number of instances will be created quickly.
- A service with basic scaling is configured by setting the maximum number of instances in the max instances parameter of the basic scaling setting.
- This allows tasks such as complex initializations and applications that rely on the state of the memory over time.

- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- The following limits apply specifically to the use of request handlers: Limit Amount Request size 32 megabytes Response size 32 megabytes Request timeout Depends on the type of scaling your app uses Maximum total number of files (app files and static files) 10,000 total 1,000 per directory Maximum size of an application file 32 megabytes Maximum size of a static file 32 megabytes Maximum total size of all application and static files First 1 gigabyte is free $ 0.026 per gigabyte per month after first 1 gigabyte Pending request timeout 10 seconds Maximum size of a single request header field 8 kilobytes for second-generation runtimes in the standard environment.
- You can configure startup instructions by adding entrypoint to app.yaml. app . run ( host = "127.0.0.1" , port = 8080 , debug = True ) Quotas and limits App Engine automatically allocates resources to your application as traffic increases.
- When a service receives standard HTTP traffic at high volume while also serving Task queue or Cloud Tasks traffic at much lower volume, there is a disproportionate impact on the latency of the Task queue or the Cloud Tasks traffic.
- You should also consider serving latency sensitive requests from Cloud Tasks with a dedicated major version or service.
