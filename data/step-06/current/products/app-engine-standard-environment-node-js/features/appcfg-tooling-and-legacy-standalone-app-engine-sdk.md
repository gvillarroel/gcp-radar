Evidence snippets:
- Home Documentation Application hosting App Engine Standard environment Guides Send feedback Configuring warmup requests to improve performance Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- If warmup requests are enabled for your application, App Engine attempts to detect when your application needs a new instance and initiates a warmup request to initialize a new instance.
- Enabling warmup requests Warmup requests are used by the App Engine scheduler, which controls the auto scaling of instances based on user-supplied configuration.
- When deploying to Google App Engine, a webserver process such as Gunicorn will serve the app.

Evidence snippets:
- Because several of the legacy runtimes are no longer maintained by their respective open-source communities, as an App Engine developer, you may face hard choices on whether to invest time and effort in migrating to a newer runtime or else incur growing costs to retain your app on a legacy runtime.
- To reduce runtime migration complexity, Google Cloud now supports a set of App Engine legacy bundled services and their associated APIs on second-generation runtimes, which include Python 3 , Java 11+ , Go 1.12+ , and PHP 7+ .

- How apps access the App Engine legacy bundled services In runtime migration scenarios, you often also have the option to use Google Cloud products that offer similar functionality as the legacy bundled services.
