Evidence snippets:
- See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License. from flask import Flask If entrypoint is not defined in app.yaml, App Engine will look for an app called app in main.py. app = Flask ( name ) @app . route ( "/" ) def hello (): """Return a friendly HTTP greeting.
- App Engine pending queue prioritization During periods of heavy traffic, App Engine might place requests in a pending queue while waiting for an available instance with the following prioritization: App Engine prioritizes other queued requests over pending queued requests from Task queue .
- You can configure startup instructions by adding entrypoint to app.yaml. app . run ( host = "127.0.0.1" , port = 8080 , debug = True ) Quotas and limits App Engine automatically allocates resources to your application as traffic increases.
- Requests from App Engine Cloud Tasks also share this pending queue priority behavior for compatibility reasons.
