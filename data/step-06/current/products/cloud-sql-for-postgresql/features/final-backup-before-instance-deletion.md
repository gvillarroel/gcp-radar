# Final backup before instance deletion

Product: Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

Cloud SQL can create a final backup before an instance is deleted so the data can be restored later to a new instance.

## Extended Definition

Cloud SQL can create a final backup before an instance is deleted so the data can be restored later to a new instance.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

Evidence snippets:
- For standard backups, since instance names can be used after an instance is deleted in Cloud SQL, retained backups are stored in your Google Cloud project with a field called instance deletion time .
- You can also set an Cloud SQL custom organization policy to take a final back at instance deletion for all instances in your organization and set a standard retention period.
- Final backup Final backups let you take a backup of your Cloud SQL instance before you delete the instance.
- Backup request types You can take on-demand, automated, or final backups for your Cloud SQL instances.

- Before you begin To manage retained backups in a Google Cloud project, you need the following permissions: Console Task Required permissions List backups cloudsql.backupRuns.list Describe a backup cloudsql.backupRuns.get Update a backup cloudsql.backupRuns.update Delete a backup cloudsql.backupRuns.delete gcloud Action Command Required permissions List backups gcloud sql backups list cloudsql.backupRuns.list Describe a backup gcloud sql backups describe cloudsql.backupRuns.get Update a backup gcloud sql backups patch cloudsql.backupRuns.update Delete a backup gcloud sql backups delete cloudsql.backupRuns.delete REST Action Method Required permissions List backups backups.listBackup cloudsql.backupRuns.list Describe a backup backups.getBackup cloudsql.backupRuns.get Update a backup backups.updateBackup cloudsql.backupRuns.update Delete a backup backups.deleteBackup cloudsql.backupRuns.delete List all backups for a deleted instance You can see a list of all retained and final backups for a deleted instance for your Google Cloud console project.
- MySQL PostgreSQL SQL Server You can manage backups after an instance is deleted if you elected to retain backups after instance deletion , or took a final backup prior to deleting your instance.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method PATCH -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /backups/ BACKUP ID ?update mask=description" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: Response { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /backups/ BACKUP ID ", "status": "DONE", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2024-02-15T00:10:22.078Z", "operationType": "UPDATE BACKUP", "name": " OPERATION ID ", "targetId": " BACKUP ID ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "targetProject": " PROJECT ID " } Delete a backup associated with a deleted instance You can delete a final or retained on-demand and automated backup for a deleted instance at any time.

Evidence snippets:
- Terraform To create a backup for a database, use a Terraform resource . resource "google sql database instance" "instance" { name = "postgres-instance-backup" region = "us-central1" database version = "POSTGRES 14" settings { tier = "db-custom-2-7680" backup configuration { enabled = true start time = "20:55" } } set deletion protection to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by use of Terraform whereas deletion protection enabled flag protects this instance at the GCP level. deletion protection = false } Apply the changes To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.
- To preserve your data, you can either take a final backup of your instance at time of deletion, enable retained backups for your instance before you delete it, or export your data to Cloud Storage before you delete it.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method PATCH -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID ", "status": "PENDING", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2020-01-16T02:32:12.281Z", "operationType": "UPDATE", "name": " OPERATION ID ", "targetId": " INSTANCE ID ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "targetProject": " PROJECT ID " } REST v1beta To update the final backup retention days setting, do the following: Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: PROJECT ID : the project ID INSTANCE ID : the instance ID RETENTION DAYS : the number of days to retain final backups HTTP method and URL: PATCH https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID Request JSON body: { "settings": { "FinalBackupConfig": { "retentionDays: RETENTION DAYS } } } To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
