Evidence snippets:
- Make the following replacements: INSTANCE NAME : the name of the Cloud SQL instance to which Private Service Connect endpoints in VPC networks can connect PROJECT ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance The following example shows a sample output for this command: gcloud sql instances describe myinstance \ --project = 12345 ... pscServiceAttachmentLink: projects/45678/regions/myregion/serviceAttachments/myserviceattachment REST Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: PROJECT ID : the ID or project number of the Google Cloud project that contains the instance INSTANCE NAME : the name of the instance HTTP method and URL: GET https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE NAME To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
- To connect to the Cloud SQL instance, use the internal IP address. psql "sslmode=disable dbname= DATABASE NAME user= USERNAME hostaddr= IP ADDRESS " Make the following replacements: DATABASE NAME : the name of the Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL database that's contained within the instance USERNAME : the name of the user that's connecting to the instance IP ADDRESS : the endpoint's IP address Connect using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is a connector that provides secure access to an instance with Private Service Connect enabled without a need for authorized networks or for configuring SSL.
- If you use Private Service Connect to connect to a Cloud SQL instance from multiple VPC networks, then each network has its own administrator. dns.admin Grants full control over Cloud DNS resources, including DNS zones and records. cloudsql.admin Provides full control of a Cloud SQL instance and controls the instance over its lifecycle. cloudsql.instanceUser Provides access to the Cloud SQL instance.
- You can find the tenant project ID in the service attachment URL shown in the output: ADMIN PROJECT= PROJECT ID INSTANCE NAME= INSTANCE NAME TENANT PROJECT ID=$(gcloud --project=$ADMIN PROJECT sql instances describe $INSTANCE NAME grep pscServiceAttachmentLink cut -f 2 -d "/") Replace the following: PROJECT ID : the project ID for the Google Cloud project you're using.
