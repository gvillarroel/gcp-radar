Evidence snippets:
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method PATCH -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ REPLICA INSTANCE NAME ", "status": "PENDING", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2020-01-16T02:32:12.281Z", "operationType": "CREATE REPLICA", "name": " OPERATION ID ", "targetId": " REPLICA INSTANCE NAME ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "targetProject": " PROJECT ID " } Configure read replicas for IAM database authentication If you enable the cloudsql.iam authentication flag on the primary instance, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL enables it on the read replicas automatically.
- However, if you don't enable this flag on the primary instance, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL doesn't enable it on the read replicas.
- MySQL PostgreSQL SQL Server This page describes how to create a read replica for a Cloud SQL instance.
- Follow steps 4-6 for each new cascading replica that you want to create. gcloud Create the new replica by specifying your primary replica as the primary instance using the --master-instance-name flag: gcloud sql instances create REPLICA NAME \ --master-instance-name = PARENT REPLICA NAME \ Replace the following: REPLICA NAME : the unique ID for the replica that you are creating PARENT REPLICA NAME : the name of the parent replica After you create the cascading replica, you can see that the changes made to the primary instance are replicated through all the replicas in the cascading replicas chain. curl To create a replica under the parent replica, edit the following JSON code sample, and save it to a file called request.json : { "masterInstanceName" : " PARENT REPLICA NAME " , "project" : " PROJECT ID " , "name" : " REPLICA NAME " , "region" : " REPLICA REGION " , "settings" : { "tier" : " MACHINE TYPE " , } } Run the following command: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer " $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -d @request.json "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances" Troubleshoot Issue Troubleshooting Read replica didn't start replicating on creation.
