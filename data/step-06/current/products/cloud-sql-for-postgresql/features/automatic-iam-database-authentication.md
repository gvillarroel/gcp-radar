- Automatic IAM database authentication Automatic IAM database authentication lets you hand off requesting and managing access tokens to an intermediary Cloud SQL connector , such as the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or one of the Cloud SQL Language Connectors.
- Feature Built-in database authentication IAM database authentication (individual) IAM group authentication Authentication method Password Temporary authentication token Temporary authentication token Network traffic encryption SSL not required SSL required SSL required User management Manual Centralized through IAM Centralized through IAM and Cloud Identity groups IAM group authentication IAM group authentication lets you manage Cloud SQL users at a group level.
- Cloud SQL IAM database authentication for different instance scenarios Read replicas IAM database authentication is not enabled in a read replica automatically, even when it is enabled on the primary instance.
- Automatic IAM database authentication requires the use of a Cloud SQL connector and is supported by the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy , the Go connector , the Java connector , and the Python connector .

Evidence snippets:
- IAM database authentication Built-in authentication Description IAM database authentication lets you authenticate to databases with Google Cloud IAM user and service accounts by using short-lived access tokens instead of passwords.
- When you're using IAM database authentication and want to refresh your OAuth 2.0 access tokens automatically.
- For more information, see automatic IAM database authentication .
- Summary Recommendation : Unless you have applications or workflows that depend on built-in database authentication, use IAM database authentication whenever possible.

- Terraform To add IAM user and service accounts on an instance with IAM database authentication enabled, use a Terraform resource . resource "google sql database instance" "default" { name = "postgres-db-auth-instance-name-test" region = "us-west4" database version = "POSTGRES 14" settings { tier = "db-custom-2-7680" database flags { name = "cloudsql.iam authentication" value = "on" } } } Specify the email address of the IAM user to add to the instance This resource does not create a new IAM user account; this account must already exist resource "google sql user" "iam user" { name = "test-user@example.com" instance = google sql database instance.default.name type = "CLOUD IAM USER" } Specify the email address of the IAM service account to add to the instance This resource does not create a new IAM service account; this service account must already exist Create a new IAM service account resource "google service account" "default" { account id = "cloud-sql-postgres-sa" display name = "Cloud SQL for Postgres Service Account" } resource "google sql user" "iam service account user" { Note: for PostgreSQL only, Google Cloud requires that you omit the ".gserviceaccount.com" suffix from the service account email due to length limits on database usernames. name = trimsuffix(google service account.default.email, ".gserviceaccount.com") instance = google sql database instance.default.name type = "CLOUD IAM SERVICE ACCOUNT" } Apply the changes To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.
- Delete the changes To delete your changes, do the following: To disable deletion protection, in your Terraform configuration file set the deletion protection argument to false . deletion protection = "false" Apply the updated Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes at the prompt: terraform apply Remove resources previously applied with your Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes at the prompt: terraform destroy REST v1 Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: PROJECT ID : the project ID INSTANCE ID : the instance ID for the instance you are adding the user to USERNAME : the email address for the user USER TYPE : the Cloud SQL user type, which is one of the following IAM user types: CLOUD IAM USER CLOUD IAM SERVICE ACCOUNT CLOUD IAM GROUP ROLE 1 , ROLE 2 ..., ROLE N : the database role or roles to assign to the IAM user, service account, or group HTTP method and URL: POST https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID /users Request JSON body: { "name": " USERNAME ", "type": " USER TYPE ", "databaseRoles": [ " ROLE 1 ", " ROLE 2 " ] } To send your request, expand one of these options: curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell) Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell , which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI .
