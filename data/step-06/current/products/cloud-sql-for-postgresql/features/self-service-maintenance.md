Evidence snippets:
- After you check your current maintenance version , you can apply a fix by performing a self-service maintenance update to the latest release.
- Please use this table to find the name of the maintenance version to apply, and use that version or the latest version available: PostgreSQL version Maintenance version PostgreSQL 9.6 POSTGRES 9 6 24.R20220710.01 02 PostgreSQL 10 POSTGRES 10 21.R20220710.01 02 PostgreSQL 11 POSTGRES 11 16.R20220710.01 02 PostgreSQL 12 POSTGRES 12 11.R20220710.01 02 PostgreSQL 13 POSTGRES 13 7.R20220710.01 02 After you have identified the name of the maintenance version, please upgrade to the target maintenance version , performing the corresponding update of your instances (to the latest maintenance version).
- To use this version of the extension, update your instance to one of the following: POSTGRES 17 0.R20241011.00 03 (for PostgreSQL instances, version 17) [PostgreSQL version].R20240910.01 17 (for PostgreSQL instances, versions 13 to 16) For more information, see Self-service maintenance .
