Evidence snippets:
- To install the DB Context Enrichment extension, follow these steps: Install the DB Context Enrichment Gemini CLI extension: gemini extensions install https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/db-context-enrichment Note: The extension requires a Gemini API key at installation to authenticate with the Gemini API and enable context generation.
- To prepare the environment, perform the following steps: Install Gemini CLI Install the DB Context Enrichment extension Setup database connection Install Gemini CLI To install Gemini CLI, see Get Started with Gemini CLI .
- Generate Context The extensions installed earlier empower Gemini CLI to help you author context in the form of a JSON file.
- Enable required services Enable the following services for your project: Data Analytics API with Gemini Gemini for Google Cloud API Dataplex Universal Catalog API Prepare a Cloud SQL instance Make sure that you have access to an existing Cloud SQL instance or create a new one.

Evidence snippets:
- For example, a log might have information similar to the following: { insertId: "..." logName: "projects/.../logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata access" protoPayload: { @type: "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog" authenticationInfo: { principalEmail: "..." } authorizationInfo: [ 0: { granted: true permission: "cloudsql.instances.login" resource: "instances/..." resourceAttributes: { } } ] methodName: "cloudsql.instances.login" request: { @type: "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.sql.authorization.v1.InstancesLoginRequest" clientIpAddress: "..." database: "..." databaseSessionId: ... instance: "projects/.../locations/us-central1/instances/..." user: "..." } requestMetadata: { callerIp: "..." destinationAttributes: { } requestAttributes: { auth: { } time: "..." } } resourceName: "instances/..." serviceName: "cloudsql.googleapis.com" status: { } } receiveTimestamp: "..." resource: { labels: { database id: "...:..." project id: "..." region: "us-central" } type: "cloudsql database" } severity: "INFO" timestamp: "..." } Troubleshoot a login failure When an attempt to log in fails, PostgreSQL returns a minimal error message for security reasons.
