Evidence snippets:
- How server certificate rotation works Cloud SQL provides ways to rotate your server certificate, so the new certificate can be seamlessly swapped in before the old certificate expires.
- For instances that use the per-instance CA, shared CA, or customer-managed CA hierarchies, about three months before the server certificate expires for a Cloud SQL instance, the project owners receive an email from Cloud SQL, stating that the certificate rotation process has begun for that instance.
- For connections that use Cloud SQL Auth Proxy or Cloud SQL Language Connectors, the connections are automatically encrypted with SSL/TLS along with client and server identity verification without requiring you to download a server CA certificate and client certificate.
- Optionally, your SSL/TLS connection can perform server identity verification by validating the server certificate installed on the Cloud SQL instance and client identity verification by validating the client certificate installed on the client.

Evidence snippets:
- RotateServerCertificate Rotates the server certificate version to one previously added with the addServerCertificate method. addServerCa Adds a new trusted Certificate Authority (CA) version for the specified instance. addServerCertificate Add a new trusted server certificate version for the specified instance using Certificate Authority Service (CAS) server CA. clone Creates a Cloud SQL instance as a clone of the source instance. delete Deletes a Cloud SQL instance. demote Demotes an existing standalone instance to be a Cloud SQL read replica for an external database server. demoteMaster Demotes the stand-alone instance to be a Cloud SQL read replica for an external database server. export Exports data from a Cloud SQL instance to a Cloud Storage bucket as a SQL dump or CSV file. failover Initiates a manual failover of a high availability (HA) primary instance to a standby instance, which becomes the primary instance. get Retrieves a resource containing information about a Cloud SQL instance. import Imports data into a Cloud SQL instance from a SQL dump or CSV file in Cloud Storage. insert Creates a new Cloud SQL instance. list Lists instances under a given project. listServerCas Lists all of the trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) for the specified instance. patch Partially updates settings of a Cloud SQL instance by merging the request with the current configuration. pointInTimeRestore Point in time restore for an instance managed by Google Cloud Backup and Disaster Recovery. preCheckMajorVersionUpgrade Execute MVU Pre-checks promoteReplica Promotes the read replica instance to be an independent Cloud SQL primary instance. reencrypt Reencrypt CMEK instance with latest key version. resetSslConfig Deletes all client certificates and generates a new server SSL certificate for the instance. restart Restarts a Cloud SQL instance. restoreBackup Restores a backup of a Cloud SQL instance. rotateServerCa Rotates the server certificate to one signed by the Certificate Authority (CA) version previously added with the addServerCA method. startReplica Starts the replication in the read replica instance. stopReplica Stops the replication in the read replica instance. switchover Switches over from the primary instance to the DR replica instance. truncateLog Truncate MySQL general and slow query log tables MySQL only. update Updates settings of a Cloud SQL instance.

- If you must use the requireSsl flag for backward compatibility, then only the following value pairs are valid: For PostgreSQL and MySQL: sslMode=ALLOW UNENCRYPTED AND ENCRYPTED and requireSsl=false sslMode=ENCRYPTED ONLY and requireSsl=false sslMode=TRUSTED CLIENT CERTIFICATE REQUIRED and requireSsl=true For SQL Server: sslMode=ALLOW UNENCRYPTED AND ENCRYPTED and requireSsl=false sslMode=ENCRYPTED ONLY and requireSsl=true The value of sslMode has priority over the value of requireSsl .
