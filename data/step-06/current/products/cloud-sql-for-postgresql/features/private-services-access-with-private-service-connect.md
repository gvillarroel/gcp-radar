Evidence snippets:
- For more information, see Configure both private services access and Private Service Connect . gcloud To create an instance with Private Service Connect enabled for the instance, use the gcloud sql instances create command: gcloud sql instances create INSTANCE NAME \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION NAME \ --enable-private-service-connect \ --allowed-psc-projects = ALLOWED PROJECTS \ --availability-type = AVAILABILITY TYPE \ --no-assign-ip \ --tier = MACHINE TYPE \ --database-version = DATABASE VERSION Make the following replacements: INSTANCE NAME : the name of the instance.
- Use the following sample to create an IPv4 Private Service Connect endpoint. resource "google compute address" "default" { name = "psc-compute-address" region = "us-central1" address type = "INTERNAL" subnetwork = "default" # Replace value with the name of the subnet here. address = "10.128.0.42" # Replace value with the IP address to reserve. } data "google sql database instance" "default" { name = resource.google sql database instance.default.name } resource "google compute forwarding rule" "default" { name = "psc-forwarding-rule-${google sql database instance.default.name}" region = "us-central1" network = "default" ip address = google compute address.default.self link load balancing scheme = "" target = data.google sql database instance.default.psc service attachment link allow psc global access = true } Use the following sample to create an IPv6 Private Service Connect endpoint. resource "google compute network" "ipv6 default" { name = "net-ipv6" auto create subnetworks = false enable ula internal ipv6 = true } resource "google compute subnetwork" "ipv6 default" { name = "subnet-internal-ipv6" ip cidr range = "10.0.0.0/16" region = "us-central1" stack type = "IPV4 IPV6" ipv6 access type = "INTERNAL" network = google compute network.ipv6 default.id } resource "google compute address" "ipv6 default" { name = "psc-compute-ipv6-address-${google sql database instance.default.name}" region = "us-central1" address type = "INTERNAL" subnetwork = google compute subnetwork.ipv6 default.name ip version = "IPV6" } resource "google compute forwarding rule" "ipv6 ilb example" { name = "ipv6-psc-forwarding-rule-${google sql database instance.default.name}" region = "us-central1" load balancing scheme = "" target = data.google sql database instance.default.psc service attachment link network = google compute network.ipv6 default.name subnetwork = google compute subnetwork.ipv6 default.name ip address = google compute address.ipv6 default.id allow psc global access = true } To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID ", "status": "PENDING", "user": USER , "insertTime": "2025-05-13T20:44:23.064Z", "operationType": "UPDATE", "targetId": " INSTANCE ID ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "targetProject": " PROJECT ID "," } Test connectivity To test inbound connectivity to a Cloud SQL instance with Private Service Connect enabled, set the IP address of the Private Service Connect endpoint to be the destination IP address. gcloud To create a connectivity test for a Cloud SQL instance with Private Service Connect enabled, use the gcloud network-management connectivity-tests create command: gcloud network-management connectivity-tests create CONNECTIVITY TEST NAME \ --source-instance = SOURCE INSTANCE \ --destination-cloud-sql-instance = DESTINATION CLOUD SQL INSTANCE \ --destination-network = DESTINATION NETWORK \ --destination-port = DESTINATION PORT \ --protocol = tcp Make the following replacements: CONNECTIVITY TEST NAME : the name of the connectivity test.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE NAME ", "status": "RUNNING", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2020-01-16T02:32:12.281Z", "startTime": "2023-06-14T18:48:35.499Z", "operationType": "CREATE", "name": " OPERATION ID ", "targetId": " INSTANCE NAME ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "targetProject": " PROJECT ID " } Get the service attachment After creating a Cloud SQL instance with Private Service Connect enabled, get the service attachment URI and use it to create the Private Service Connect endpoint. gcloud To view summary information about an instance with Private Service Connect enabled, such as the pscServiceAttachmentLink field which displays the URI that points to the service attachment of the instance, use the gcloud sql instances describe command: gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE NAME \ --project = PROJECT ID Note: The service attachment URI is used to create the Private Service Connect endpoint.

Evidence snippets:
- To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the Required permissions section: Required permissions The following permissions are required to manage a private services access connection: compute.addresses.create compute.addresses.list compute.globalAddresses.create compute.globalAddresses.createInternal compute.globalAddresses.list compute.networks.list compute.networks.use servicenetworking.services.addPeering serviceusage.services.list You might also be able to get these permissions with custom roles or other predefined roles .
- Configure private services access for Cloud SQL Important: When you create a private connection between your VPC network and the Cloud SQL service, it becomes available for use by any Google service that supports private services access.
- The following example allocates an IP range that allows resources in the VPC network my-vpc-network to connect to Cloud SQL instances using private IP. gcloud compute addresses create google-managed-services-my-vpc-network \ --global \ --purpose = VPC PEERING \ --prefix-length = 16 \ --network = projects/myprojectid/global/networks/myvpcnetwork \ --project = my-project Terraform To allocate an IP address range, use a Terraform resource . resource "google compute global address" "private ip address" { name = "private-ip-address" purpose = "VPC PEERING" address type = "INTERNAL" prefix length = 16 network = google compute network.peering network.id } Apply the changes To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.
- If you see an error about either the compute.globalAddresses.list permission or the compute.projects.get permission for the project, run this gcloud command: gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding HOST PROJECT NAME \ --member = serviceAccount:service- HOST PROJECT NUMBER @service-networking.iam.gserviceaccount.com \ --role = roles/servicenetworking.serviceAgent Change the private service access configuration You can change the allocated address range of a private service connection without modifying any existing Cloud SQL instances.

Evidence snippets:
- The range name should comply with RFC-1035 and be within 1-63 characters. ( gcloud alpha sql instances create ). --enable-google-private-path : If you use this parameter, then you allow other Google Cloud services, such as BigQuery, to access data in Cloud SQL and make queries against this data over a private connection.
- For Private IP-only instances, enabling Data API access lets authorized users connect and execute SQL statements from the public internet.
