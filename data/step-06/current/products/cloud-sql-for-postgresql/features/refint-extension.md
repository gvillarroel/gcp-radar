# refint extension

Product: Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

The refint extension checks foreign key constraints between referencing and referenced tables.

## Extended Definition

The refint extension checks foreign key constraints between referencing and referenced tables.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

Evidence snippets:
- Disable the foreign key checks for the mysql client session and access the table. mysql> SET SESSION FOREIGN KEY CHECKS = 0 ; Inspect the parent and child tables and identify the mismatches between the foreign key and referenced key columns. mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE parent table ; mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE child table ; Verify the corresponding columns have similar data types.
- If it detects the discrepancy, it blocks the access to that table. mysql> select from db.table ; ERROR 1146 ( 42S02 ) : Table db.table doesn ' t exist Turning off foreign key checks for the MySQL session allows access to the table again.
- Turn off 'foreign key checks' and try again. [ Warning ] InnoDB: Cannot open table db/table from the internal data dictionary of InnoDB though the .frm file for the table exists.
- Table db.table doesn't exist If one or more InnoDB table(s) disappeared after a MySQL restart and the MySQL error log has the following warnings at the same time, it is due to the foreign key and referenced key columns being out-of-sync. [ Warning ] InnoDB: Load table db.table failed, the table has missing foreign key indexes.
