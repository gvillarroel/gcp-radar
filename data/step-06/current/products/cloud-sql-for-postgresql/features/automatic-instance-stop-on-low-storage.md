Evidence snippets:
- RotateServerCertificate Rotates the server certificate version to one previously added with the addServerCertificate method. addServerCa Add a new trusted Certificate Authority (CA) version for the specified instance. addServerCertificate Add a new trusted server certificate version for the specified instance using Certificate Authority Service (CAS) server CA. clone Creates a Cloud SQL instance as a clone of the source instance. delete Deletes a Cloud SQL instance. demote Demotes an existing standalone instance to be a Cloud SQL read replica for an external database server. demoteMaster Demotes the stand-alone instance to be a Cloud SQL read replica for an external database server. executeSql Execute SQL statements. export Exports data from a Cloud SQL instance to a Cloud Storage bucket as a SQL dump or CSV file. failover Initiates a manual failover of a high availability (HA) primary instance to a standby instance, which becomes the primary instance. get Retrieves a resource containing information about a Cloud SQL instance. import Imports data into a Cloud SQL instance from a SQL dump or CSV file in Cloud Storage. insert Creates a new Cloud SQL instance. list Lists instances under a given project. listServerCas Lists all of the trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) for the specified instance. patch Partially updates settings of a Cloud SQL instance by merging the request with the current configuration. pointInTimeRestore Point in time restore for an instance managed by Google Cloud Backup and Disaster Recovery. promoteReplica Promotes the read replica instance to be an independent Cloud SQL primary instance. reencrypt Reencrypt CMEK instance with latest key version. resetSslConfig Deletes all client certificates and generates a new server SSL certificate for the instance. restart Restarts a Cloud SQL instance. restoreBackup Restores a backup of a Cloud SQL instance. rotateServerCa Rotates the server certificate to one signed by the Certificate Authority (CA) version previously added with the addServerCA method. startReplica Starts the replication in the read replica instance. stopReplica Stops the replication in the read replica instance. switchover Switches over from the primary instance to the DR replica instance. truncateLog Truncate MySQL general and slow query log tables MySQL only. update Updates settings of a Cloud SQL instance.
- This can be either ASYNCHRONOUS or SYNCHRONOUS . (Deprecated) This property was only applicable to First Generation instances. storageAutoResizeLimit string ( Int64Value format) The maximum size to which storage capacity can be automatically increased.
- CLOUD SQL AUTOMATION The record is managed by Cloud SQL, which will create, update, and delete the DNS records for the zone automatically when the Cloud SQL database instance is created or updated.
- PscAutoConnectionConfig Settings for an automatically-setup Private Service Connect consumer endpoint that is used to connect to a Cloud SQL instance.

- For example, you can use NSSM to configure the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy as a Windows service, and NSSM monitors the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy and restarts it automatically if it stops responding.
- If a replica failover or switchover operation occurs for the primary instance, then the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy detects changes to the DNS record automatically.
