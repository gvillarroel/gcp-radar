Evidence snippets:
- You can use this to track the last time that a row in a database table is modified. pg background (version 1.2): lets you run arbitrary commands in a background worker. pg squeeze (version 1.5): removes unused space from a table and lets you use an index to sort records or rows (tuples) of the table. tcn (version 1.0): provides a trigger function that notifies listeners of changes to the content of database tables.
- January 17, 2025 Feature Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL version 17 adds support for the following extensions and plugins: Extensions and plugins ip4r oracle fdw orafce pg background pg bigm pgfincore pg hint plan pg partman pg proctab pgrouting pg similarity pgtap pgtt pg wait sampling PL/Proxy plv8 postgresql anonymizer postgresql hll prefix temporal tables Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL version 17 doesn't support: rdkit pg squeeze To use these extensions and plugins in your PostgreSQL 17 instance, update your instance to the POSTGRES 17 2.R20241011.00 11 maintenance version.
- Use this flag when you're deciding whether to run a VACUUM . autovacuum vacuum insert threshold : specify the minimum number of inserted records or rows (tuples) that you need to run a VACUUM in any database table. effective io concurrency : set the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that can run simultaneously. hash mem multiplier : compute the maximum amount of memory that hash-based operations can use. logical decoding work mem : specify the maximum amount of memory that logical decoding can use before some of the decoded changes are written to a local disk. maintenance io concurrency : set the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that can run simultaneously for maintenance work that's done for client sessions. vacuum failsafe age : specify the maximum age (in transactions) that a database table's pg class.relfrozenxid field can attain before a VACUUM takes extraordinary measures to avoid a system-wide wraparound failure for transaction IDs. vacuum multixact failsafe age : specify the maximum age (in multiple transactions) that a database table's pg class.relminmxid field can attain before a VACUUM takes extraordinary measures to avoid a system-wide wraparound failure for multiple transaction IDs.
- Extension and plugin versions pg cron is upgraded from 1.4.1 to 1.5. pg partman is upgraded from 4.7.0 to 4.7.3. postgresql-hll is upgraded from 2.16 to 2.17. pg repack is upgraded from 1.4.7 to 1.4.8. wal2json is upgraded from 2.4 to 2.5. pg hint plan is upgraded, as follows: from 1.3.7 to 1.3.8 (for PostgreSQL versions 11-13) from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1 (for PostgreSQL version 14) from 1.4.0 to 1.5.0 (for PostgreSQL version 15) If you use a maintenance window, then the updates to the minor, extension, and plugin versions happen according to the timeframe that you set in the window.

Evidence snippets:
- Export data using the custom format from Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL To use the custom format, from a command line, run pg dump : pg dump \ -U USERNAME \ --format = custom \ --no-owner \ --no-acl \ DATABASE NAME > DATABASE NAME .dmp Export data from multiple files in parallel from Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL You can only use the directory output format to export data from multiple files in parallel .
- This format is not compatible with pg restore , and must be imported using the Google Cloud console import command or psql client. --no-acl This flag is required if your dump would otherwise contain statements to grant or revoke membership in a SUPERUSER role. --clean This optional flag enables you to include the DROP <object> SQL statement that's required to drop (clean) database objects before you import them. --if-exists This optional flag enables you to include the IF EXISTS SQL statement with each DROP statement that's produced by the clean flag.
- To export all PostgreSQL databases, run the following command: pg dumpall \ -h HOST NAME -l DATABASE NAME --exclude-database = cloudsqladmin \ --exclude-database = template > pg dumpall.sql To view role passwords when dumping roles with pg dumpall , set the cloudsql.pg authid select role flag to a PostgreSQL role name.
- Import from a dump file created with the custom format to Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL If the dump file was created with custom format, run the following command: pg restore \ --list DATABASE NAME .dmp sed -E 's/(.
