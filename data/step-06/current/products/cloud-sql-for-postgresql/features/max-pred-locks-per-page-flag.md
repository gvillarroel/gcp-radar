Evidence snippets:
- February 08, 2022 Feature Cloud SQL supports the max parallel maintenance workers , max parallel workers , max parallel workers per gather , and max pred locks per transaction flags: max parallel maintenance workers sets the maximum number of parallel workers that can be started by a single utility command. max parallel workers sets the maximum number of workers that the system can support for parallel operations. max parallel workers per gather sets the maximum number of workers that can be started by a single Gather or Gather Merge node. max pred locks per transaction controls the average number of object locks allocated for each transaction.
- October 26, 2021 Feature Cloud SQL now supports the max pred locks per page and max pred locks per relation flags.
- Use this flag when you're deciding whether to run a VACUUM . autovacuum vacuum insert threshold : specify the minimum number of inserted records or rows (tuples) that you need to run a VACUUM in any database table. effective io concurrency : set the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that can run simultaneously. hash mem multiplier : compute the maximum amount of memory that hash-based operations can use. logical decoding work mem : specify the maximum amount of memory that logical decoding can use before some of the decoded changes are written to a local disk. maintenance io concurrency : set the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that can run simultaneously for maintenance work that's done for client sessions. vacuum failsafe age : specify the maximum age (in transactions) that a database table's pg class.relfrozenxid field can attain before a VACUUM takes extraordinary measures to avoid a system-wide wraparound failure for transaction IDs. vacuum multixact failsafe age : specify the maximum age (in multiple transactions) that a database table's pg class.relminmxid field can attain before a VACUUM takes extraordinary measures to avoid a system-wide wraparound failure for multiple transaction IDs.

- Integration with Vertex AI --enable-google-ml-integration Enables Cloud SQL instances to connect to Vertex AI to pass requests for real-time predictions and insights to the AI. --database-flags cloudsql.enable google ml integration=on By turning this flag on, Cloud SQL can integrate with Vertex AI.
- The maximum number of instances you can have in a single project depends on the network architecture of those instances: New SQL network architecture: You can have up to 1000 instances per project.
