- Maintenance schedule Maintenance window --maintenance-window-day , --maintenance-window-hour Determines a one-hour window when Cloud SQL can perform disruptive maintenance on your instance.
- AUTOMATIC ROTATION DURING MAINTENANCE : With this option, automatic server certificate rotation is enabled during Cloud SQL scheduled maintenance or self-service maintenance updates.
- Managed Connection Pooling lets you scale your workloads by optimizing resource utilization and connection latency Cloud SQL instances using pooling and multiplexing.
