Evidence snippets:
- Set the password for the postgres user: gcloud sql users set-password postgres \ --instance = INSTANCE NAME \ --password = PASSWORD Terraform To create an instance, use a Terraform resource . resource "google sql database instance" "postgres pvp instance name" { name = "postgres-pvp-instance-name" region = "asia-northeast1" database version = "POSTGRES 14" root password = "abcABC123!" settings { tier = "db-custom-2-7680" password validation policy { min length = 6 reuse interval = 2 complexity = "COMPLEXITY DEFAULT" disallow username substring = true password change interval = "30s" enable password policy = true } } set deletion protection to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by use of Terraform whereas deletion protection enabled flag protects this instance at the GCP level. deletion protection = false } Apply the changes To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.
- For Private IP-only instances, enabling Data API access lets authorized users connect and execute SQL statements from the public internet.
- This integration lets you apply large language models (LLMs), which are hosted in Vertex AI, to a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL database.
