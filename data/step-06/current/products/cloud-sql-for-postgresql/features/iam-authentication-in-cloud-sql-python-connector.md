- Configuration options Cloud SQL Auth Proxy , or Cloud SQL Language Connectors, including Cloud SQL Java connector Cloud SQL Python connector Cloud SQL Go connector Cloud SQL Node.js connector The following Google Cloud services use an embedded Cloud SQL Auth Proxy when you connect to a Cloud SQL instance over public IP address: Cloud Run App Engine flexible environment App Engine standard environment To configure SSL/TLS certificates on the Cloud SQL instance and for your client, do the following: Choose a server CA mode for your instance .
- Tools for connecting to Cloud SQL The following table contains some options for connecting to Cloud SQL: Connection option More information Cloud SQL Auth Proxy About the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Connecting using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Connecting using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Docker Image gcloud CLI gcloud sql connect Cloud SQL language connectors Connect using Cloud SQL Connectors for Java, Python and Go.
- Using a direct connection provides the following benefits: Lower latency compared to connections using Cloud SQL connectors.
- Remove networking options from an instance Cloud SQL supports the removal of the following networking options from an instance: Public IP from an instance with both private services access and public IP Public IP from an instance with public IP, private services access, and Private Service Connect Private Service Connect from an instance with both Private Service Connect and private services access Private Service Connect from an instance with Private Service Connect, private services access, and public IP Enable networking options for an instance You can enable Cloud SQL supports enabling the following connection options for instances: Private services access on an instance with public IP only Private Service Connect on an instance with private services access only Private Service Connect on an instance with both private services access and public IP Public IP on an instance with private services access only Limitations You can't create an instance with both a public IP address and Private Service Connect.
