Evidence snippets:
- For this reason, we don't recommend that you use manual IAM database authentication for long-lived processes or applications that rely on connection pooling.
- Feature Built-in database authentication IAM database authentication (individual) IAM group authentication Authentication method Password Temporary authentication token Temporary authentication token Network traffic encryption SSL not required SSL required SSL required User management Manual Centralized through IAM Centralized through IAM and Cloud Identity groups IAM group authentication IAM group authentication lets you manage Cloud SQL users at a group level.
- Manual IAM database authentication Manual IAM database authentication requires the IAM principal to explicitly pass the access token for the password attribute in the client connection request.
- With automatic IAM database authentication, users need to pass only the IAM database username in a connection request from the client.
