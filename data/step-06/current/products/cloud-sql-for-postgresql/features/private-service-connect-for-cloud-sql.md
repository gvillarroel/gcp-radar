Evidence snippets:
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE NAME ", "status": "RUNNING", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2020-01-16T02:32:12.281Z", "startTime": "2023-06-14T18:48:35.499Z", "operationType": "CREATE", "name": " OPERATION ID ", "targetId": " INSTANCE NAME ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "targetProject": " PROJECT ID " } Retrieve the endpoint By retrieving the internal IP address, which is the Private Service Connect endpoint for an instance, you can use this endpoint to connect to the instance . gcloud To view information about an instance, including the IP address that's the Private Service Connect endpoint for the instance, use the gcloud sql instances describe command: gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE NAME \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --format = 'json(settings.ipConfiguration.pscConfig.pscAutoConnections)' Make the following replacements: INSTANCE NAME : the name of the Cloud SQL instance.
- Execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE NAME " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#instance", "state": "RUNNABLE", "databaseVersion": "POSTGRES 13", "settings": { "authorizedGaeApplications": [], "tier": "db-custom-2-7680", "kind": "sql#settings", "availabilityType": "REGIONAL", "pricingPlan": "PER USE", "replicationType": "SYNCHRONOUS", "activationPolicy": "ALWAYS", "ipConfiguration": { "authorizedNetworks": [], "pscConfig": { "allowedConsumerProjects": [ " ALLOWED PROJECTS " ], "pscAutoConnections": { consumerNetwork:"projects/ PARENT PROJECT /global/networks/ CONSUMER NETWORK ", consumerNetworkStatus:" CONSUMER NETWORK STATUS ", consumerProject:" CONSUMER PROJECT ", ipAddress:" IP ADDRESS ", status:" STATUS " }, "pscEnabled": true }, "ipv4Enabled": false }, } The following fields exist for instances that have Private Service Connect enabled for them: allowedConsumerProjects : a list of the allowed projects for the instance.
- Optionally, you can create Private Service Connect endpoints manually . gcloud To create an instance with Private Service Connect enabled for the instance, use the gcloud sql instances create command: gcloud sql instances create INSTANCE NAME \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION NAME \ --enable-private-service-connect \ --allowed-psc-projects = ALLOWED PROJECTS \ --availability-type = AVAILABILITY TYPE \ --no-assign-ip \ --tier = MACHINE TYPE \ --database-version = DATABASE VERSION \ --psc-auto-connections = network = CONSUMER NETWORK ,project = CONSUMER PROJECT Make the following replacements: INSTANCE NAME : the name of the instance.
- The following flags are invalidated or impacted: --no-assign-ip: use this flag because instances with Private Service Connect enabled aren't supported to use other connectivity types such as external IP connections --authorized-networks: you can't use this flag to add authorized networks --network: you can't use this flag because it's associated with private services access --allocated-ip-range-name: you can't use this flag because allowed IP range names aren't supported You can't configure an instance that has Private Service Connect enabled to use private services access or external IP connections.

Evidence snippets:
- You can use Private Service Connect for the following purposes: Connect to a Cloud SQL instance from multiple VPC networks that belong to different groups, teams, projects, or organizations Connect to either a primary instance or any of its read replicas Private Service Connect endpoint You can use Private Service Connect endpoints to access Cloud SQL instances privately from your consumer VPC networks.
- Limitations When using a Private Service Connect interface with a network attachment to create outbound connections to your network from your Cloud SQL instance, note the following limitations: Enabling or disabling Private Service Connect outbound connectivity requires downtime.
- Private Service Connect outbound connections You can attach a Private Service Connect interface to your existing Cloud SQL Private Service Connect-enabled instances using a network attachment to allow your Cloud SQL instance to make outbound connections to your network.
- To use Private Service Connect backends, you must setup the following resources for each serving port on which you want to access a given Cloud SQL instance: Private Service Connect Network Endpoint Group (NEG) , which must reference the service attachment and a serving port of the Cloud SQL instance.
