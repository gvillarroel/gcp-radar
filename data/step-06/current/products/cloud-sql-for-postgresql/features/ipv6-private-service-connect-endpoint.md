Evidence snippets:
- Use the following sample to create an IPv4 Private Service Connect endpoint. resource "google compute address" "default" { name = "psc-compute-address" region = "us-central1" address type = "INTERNAL" subnetwork = "default" # Replace value with the name of the subnet here. address = "10.128.0.42" # Replace value with the IP address to reserve. } data "google sql database instance" "default" { name = resource.google sql database instance.default.name } resource "google compute forwarding rule" "default" { name = "psc-forwarding-rule-${google sql database instance.default.name}" region = "us-central1" network = "default" ip address = google compute address.default.self link load balancing scheme = "" target = data.google sql database instance.default.psc service attachment link allow psc global access = true } Use the following sample to create an IPv6 Private Service Connect endpoint. resource "google compute network" "ipv6 default" { name = "net-ipv6" auto create subnetworks = false enable ula internal ipv6 = true } resource "google compute subnetwork" "ipv6 default" { name = "subnet-internal-ipv6" ip cidr range = "10.0.0.0/16" region = "us-central1" stack type = "IPV4 IPV6" ipv6 access type = "INTERNAL" network = google compute network.ipv6 default.id } resource "google compute address" "ipv6 default" { name = "psc-compute-ipv6-address-${google sql database instance.default.name}" region = "us-central1" address type = "INTERNAL" subnetwork = google compute subnetwork.ipv6 default.name ip version = "IPV6" } resource "google compute forwarding rule" "ipv6 ilb example" { name = "ipv6-psc-forwarding-rule-${google sql database instance.default.name}" region = "us-central1" load balancing scheme = "" target = data.google sql database instance.default.psc service attachment link network = google compute network.ipv6 default.name subnetwork = google compute subnetwork.ipv6 default.name ip address = google compute address.ipv6 default.id allow psc global access = true } To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.
- Create a service connection policy A service connection policy lets you authorize a specified service class to create a Private Service Connect endpoint in your consumer VPC network.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE ID ", "status": "PENDING", "user": USER , "insertTime": "2025-05-13T20:44:23.064Z", "operationType": "UPDATE", "targetId": " INSTANCE ID ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ PROJECT ID /operations/ OPERATION ID ", "targetProject": " PROJECT ID "," } Test connectivity To test inbound connectivity to a Cloud SQL instance with Private Service Connect enabled, set the IP address of the Private Service Connect endpoint to be the destination IP address. gcloud To create a connectivity test for a Cloud SQL instance with Private Service Connect enabled, use the gcloud network-management connectivity-tests create command: gcloud network-management connectivity-tests create CONNECTIVITY TEST NAME \ --source-instance = SOURCE INSTANCE \ --destination-cloud-sql-instance = DESTINATION CLOUD SQL INSTANCE \ --destination-network = DESTINATION NETWORK \ --destination-port = DESTINATION PORT \ --protocol = tcp Make the following replacements: CONNECTIVITY TEST NAME : the name of the connectivity test.

Evidence snippets:
- The connection propagation feature in NCC benefits the following use case for Private Service Connect deployments: You can use a common services VPC network to create multiple Private Service Connect endpoints.
- For example, if you have three VPC networks that have to connect to your instance, then you must create three Private Service Connect endpoints—one endpoint for each VPC network.
- Cloud SQL locates the service connection policy in these networks and creates a Private Service Connect endpoint that points to the service attachment of the instance.
- Service connection policy A service connection policy lets you authorize a specified service class to create a Private Service Connect connection between VPC networks.
