- Set the password for the postgres user: gcloud sql users set-password postgres \ --instance = INSTANCE NAME \ --password = PASSWORD Terraform To create an instance, use a Terraform resource . resource "google sql database instance" "postgres pvp instance name" { name = "postgres-pvp-instance-name" region = "asia-northeast1" database version = "POSTGRES 14" root password = "abcABC123!" settings { tier = "db-custom-2-7680" password validation policy { min length = 6 reuse interval = 2 complexity = "COMPLEXITY DEFAULT" disallow username substring = true password change interval = "30s" enable password policy = true } } set deletion protection to true, will ensure that one cannot accidentally delete this instance by use of Terraform whereas deletion protection enabled flag protects this instance at the GCP level. deletion protection = false } Apply the changes To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.
- Memory must be: 0.9 to 6.5 GB per vCPU A multiple of 256 MB At least 3.75 GB (3840 MB) For example, the following command creates a Cloud SQL Enterprise edition instance with two vCPUs and 7,680 MB of memory: gcloud sql instances create myinstance \ --database-version = POSTGRES 16 \ --cpu = 2 \ --memory = 7680MB \ --region = us-central1 The following command creates a Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition instance with four cores: gcloud sql instances create myinstance \ --database-version = POSTGRES 16 \ --tier = db-perf-optimized-N-4 \ --edition = ENTERPRISE PLUS \ --region = us-central1 See Custom instance configuration for more information about how to size --cpu and --memory .

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- You're trying to use a custom SAN to add more than three DNS names to the server certificate of a Cloud SQL instance.
- Execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers ` -Uri "https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT NAME " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "compute#forwardingRule", "id": " ENDPOINT ID ", "creationTimestamp": "2024-05-09T12:03:21.383-07:00", "name": " ENDPOINT NAME ", "region": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME ", "IPAddress": " IP ADDRESS ", "target": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME /serviceAttachments/ SERVICE ATTACHMENT NAME ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION NAME /forwardingRules/ ENDPOINT NAME ", "network": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /global/networks/default", "serviceDirectoryRegistrations": [ { "namespace": "goog-psc-default" } ], "networkTier": "PREMIUM", "labelFingerprint": " LABEL FINGERPRINT ID ", "fingerprint": " FINGERPRINT ID ", "pscConnectionId": " CONNECTION ID ", "pscConnectionStatus": "ACCEPTED", "allowPscGlobalAccess": true } Verify that the status of the endpoint is ACCEPTED .
- Log into the database and run this command: SELECT datname, usename, application name as appname, client addr, state, now () - backend start as conn age, now () - state change as last activity age FROM pg stat activity WHERE backend type = 'client backend' ORDER BY 6 DESC LIMIT 20 Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames: Host: localhost. is not in the cert's altnames .
- These settings remain after a session is closed, mimicking a .conf configuration: ALTER DATABASE dbname SET TIMEZONE TO ' timezone ' ; ALTER USER username SET TIMEZONE TO ' timezone ' ; These settings apply only to new connections to the database.
