Evidence snippets:
- Execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -Headers $headers -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances/ INSTANCE NAME " Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: { "kind": "sql#instance", "state": "RUNNABLE", "databaseVersion": "POSTGRES 13", "settings": { "authorizedGaeApplications": [], "tier": "db-custom-2-7680", "kind": "sql#settings", "availabilityType": "REGIONAL", "pricingPlan": "PER USE", "replicationType": "SYNCHRONOUS", "activationPolicy": "ALWAYS", "ipConfiguration": { "authorizedNetworks": [], "pscConfig": { "allowedConsumerProjects": [ " ALLOWED PROJECTS " ], "pscAutoConnections": { consumerNetwork:"projects/ PARENT PROJECT /global/networks/ CONSUMER NETWORK ", consumerNetworkStatus:" CONSUMER NETWORK STATUS ", consumerProject:" CONSUMER PROJECT ", ipAddress:" IP ADDRESS ", status:" STATUS " }, "pscEnabled": true }, "ipv4Enabled": false }, } The following fields exist for instances that have Private Service Connect enabled for them: allowedConsumerProjects : a list of the allowed projects for the instance.
- Optionally, you can create Private Service Connect endpoints manually . gcloud To create an instance with Private Service Connect enabled for the instance, use the gcloud sql instances create command: gcloud sql instances create INSTANCE NAME \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION NAME \ --enable-private-service-connect \ --allowed-psc-projects = ALLOWED PROJECTS \ --availability-type = AVAILABILITY TYPE \ --no-assign-ip \ --tier = MACHINE TYPE \ --database-version = DATABASE VERSION \ --psc-auto-connections = network = CONSUMER NETWORK ,project = CONSUMER PROJECT Make the following replacements: INSTANCE NAME : the name of the instance.
- Terraform To create an instance with Private Service Connect enabled for the instance, use the google sql database instance Terraform resource . resource "google sql database instance" "default" { name = "postgres-instance" region = "us-central1" database version = "POSTGRES 14" settings { tier = "db-custom-2-7680" availability type = "REGIONAL" backup configuration { enabled = true } ip configuration { psc config { psc enabled = true allowed consumer projects = [] } ipv4 enabled = false } } } To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.
- Use the following sample to create an IPv4 Private Service Connect endpoint. resource "google compute address" "default" { name = "psc-compute-address" region = "us-central1" address type = "INTERNAL" subnetwork = "default" # Replace value with the name of the subnet here. address = "10.128.0.42" # Replace value with the IP address to reserve. } data "google sql database instance" "default" { name = resource.google sql database instance.default.name } resource "google compute forwarding rule" "default" { name = "psc-forwarding-rule-${google sql database instance.default.name}" region = "us-central1" network = "default" ip address = google compute address.default.self link load balancing scheme = "" target = data.google sql database instance.default.psc service attachment link allow psc global access = true } Use the following sample to create an IPv6 Private Service Connect endpoint. resource "google compute network" "ipv6 default" { name = "net-ipv6" auto create subnetworks = false enable ula internal ipv6 = true } resource "google compute subnetwork" "ipv6 default" { name = "subnet-internal-ipv6" ip cidr range = "10.0.0.0/16" region = "us-central1" stack type = "IPV4 IPV6" ipv6 access type = "INTERNAL" network = google compute network.ipv6 default.id } resource "google compute address" "ipv6 default" { name = "psc-compute-ipv6-address-${google sql database instance.default.name}" region = "us-central1" address type = "INTERNAL" subnetwork = google compute subnetwork.ipv6 default.name ip version = "IPV6" } resource "google compute forwarding rule" "ipv6 ilb example" { name = "ipv6-psc-forwarding-rule-${google sql database instance.default.name}" region = "us-central1" load balancing scheme = "" target = data.google sql database instance.default.psc service attachment link network = google compute network.ipv6 default.name subnetwork = google compute subnetwork.ipv6 default.name ip address = google compute address.ipv6 default.id allow psc global access = true } To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.

Evidence snippets:
- Summary Recommendation : For improved security, we recommend that you configure your instance with a private IP address type unless you have specific requirements for an internet-accessible Cloud SQL instance, or if you're connecting from a client that doesn't meet the requirements for a VPC.
- Private networking options when using a private IP address When you configure your instance to use a private IP address, you can choose the following private networking options: private services access, Private Service Connect, or both.
- IP address type: private or public When you first create your Cloud SQL instance, you can choose whether to configure the instance with a public IP address , a private IP address , or a combination of both .
- Remove networking options from an instance Cloud SQL supports the removal of the following networking options from an instance: Public IP from an instance with both private services access and public IP Public IP from an instance with public IP, private services access, and Private Service Connect Private Service Connect from an instance with both Private Service Connect and private services access Private Service Connect from an instance with Private Service Connect, private services access, and public IP Enable networking options for an instance You can enable Cloud SQL supports enabling the following connection options for instances: Private services access on an instance with public IP only Private Service Connect on an instance with private services access only Private Service Connect on an instance with both private services access and public IP Public IP on an instance with private services access only Limitations You can't create an instance with both a public IP address and Private Service Connect.
