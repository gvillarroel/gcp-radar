Evidence snippets:
- February 07, 2024 Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL Feature The rollout of the following extensions and flags is underway : Extensions autoinc (version 1.0): provides functions for incrementing fields automatically.
- Flags cloudsql.enable pg squeeze : enables the pg squeeze extension for Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL squeeze.max xlock time : sets the time (in milliseconds) that the extension uses to finalize the processing for modifying a table squeeze.worker autostart : starts a background worker automatically squeeze.worker role : specifies the role for the background worker The rollout of the following minor versions, extension versions, and plugin versions is underway : Minor versions 11.21 is upgraded to 11.22.
- You can use this to track the last time that a row in a database table is modified. pg background (version 1.2): lets you run arbitrary commands in a background worker. pg squeeze (version 1.5): removes unused space from a table and lets you use an index to sort records or rows (tuples) of the table. tcn (version 1.0): provides a trigger function that notifies listeners of changes to the content of database tables.
- These filters are space-efficient data structures that you can use to test whether an element is a member of a set. insert username (version 1.0): provides functions for storing the current user's name into a text field.
