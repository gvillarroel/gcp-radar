Evidence snippets:
- This format is not compatible with pg restore , and must be imported using the Google Cloud console import command or psql client. --no-acl This flag is required if your dump would otherwise contain statements to grant or revoke membership in a SUPERUSER role. --clean This optional flag enables you to include the DROP <object> SQL statement that's required to drop (clean) database objects before you import them. --if-exists This optional flag enables you to include the IF EXISTS SQL statement with each DROP statement that's produced by the clean flag.
- Export data using the custom format from Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL To use the custom format, from a command line, run pg dump : pg dump \ -U USERNAME \ --format = custom \ --no-owner \ --no-acl \ DATABASE NAME > DATABASE NAME .dmp Export data from multiple files in parallel from Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL You can only use the directory output format to export data from multiple files in parallel .
- If you're using the pg dumpall utility to export all PostgreSQL databases of a cluster that aren't managed by Cloud SQL, then you don't have to use the exclude-database=cloudsqladmin flag.
- In addition, you must remove all of the following: Extension-related statements, if Cloud SQL does not support that extension.
