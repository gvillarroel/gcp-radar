- Run the following commands: GRANT pg signal backend TO USERNAME ; Find the process ID of the blocked or stuck process: SELECT pid, username, state, query FROM pg stat activity ; Stop a running or idle process using these commands: SELECT pg cancel backend ( pid ) FROM pg stat activity WHERE username = ' USERNAME ' ; SELECT pg terminate backend ( pid ) FROM pg stat activity WHERE username = ' USERNAME ' ; Instance is nearing 100% consumption of transaction IDs.
- Connect to the database and run the following query: SELECT datname, username, application name as appname, client addr, state, now() - backend start as conn age, now() - xact start as xact age, now() - query start as query age, now() - state change as last activity age, wait event type, wait event, query FROM pg stat activity WHERE state <> 'idle' ORDER BY 8 DESC LIMIT 20; You want to find out what units are being used for a specific field.
- These settings remain after a session is closed, mimicking a .conf configuration: ALTER DATABASE dbname SET TIMEZONE TO ' timezone ' ; ALTER USER username SET TIMEZONE TO ' timezone ' ; These settings apply only to new connections to the database.
