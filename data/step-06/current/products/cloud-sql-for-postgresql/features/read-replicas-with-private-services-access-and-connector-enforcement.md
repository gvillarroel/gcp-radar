Product: Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

Evidence snippets:
- It also can't replicate from an instance that supports external IP connections or from an instance that's configured with private services access . gcloud To create a read replica of an instance, use the gcloud sql instances create command: gcloud sql instances create REPLICA INSTANCE NAME \ --master-instance-name = PRIMARY INSTANCE NAME \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION NAME \ --enable-private-service-connect \ --allowed-psc-projects = ALLOWED PROJECTS \ --availability-type = AVAILABILITY TYPE \ --no-assign-ip Make the following replacements: REPLICA INSTANCE NAME : the name of the replica instance.
- Save the request body in a file named request.json , and execute the following command: $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" } Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Headers $headers -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" -InFile request.json -Uri "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ project-id /instances" Select-Object -Expand Content You should receive a JSON response similar to the following: Response { "kind": "sql#operation", "targetLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ project-id /instances/ instance-id ", "status": "PENDING", "user": "user@example.com", "insertTime": "2020-01-21T22:43:37.981Z", "operationType": "CREATE REPLICA", "name": " operation-id ", "targetId": " instance-id ", "selfLink": "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/sql/v1beta4/projects/ project-id /operations/ operation-id ", "targetProject": " project-id " } Create a read replica of an instance with Private Service Connect enabled To create a read replica of an instance with Private Service Connect enabled, use gcloud CLI or the API.
- If the primary instance has a private IP connection and the instance accepts database connections from Cloud SQL Language Connectors only, then you can't create read replicas for the instance.
- Follow steps 4-6 for each new cascading replica that you want to create. gcloud Create the new replica by specifying your primary replica as the primary instance using the --master-instance-name flag: gcloud sql instances create REPLICA NAME \ --master-instance-name = PARENT REPLICA NAME \ Replace the following: REPLICA NAME : the unique ID for the replica that you are creating PARENT REPLICA NAME : the name of the parent replica After you create the cascading replica, you can see that the changes made to the primary instance are replicated through all the replicas in the cascading replicas chain. curl To create a replica under the parent replica, edit the following JSON code sample, and save it to a file called request.json : { "masterInstanceName" : " PARENT REPLICA NAME " , "project" : " PROJECT ID " , "name" : " REPLICA NAME " , "region" : " REPLICA REGION " , "settings" : { "tier" : " MACHINE TYPE " , } } Run the following command: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer " $( gcloud auth print-access-token ) -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -d @request.json "https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /instances" Troubleshoot Issue Troubleshooting Read replica didn't start replicating on creation.

Evidence snippets:
- To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the Required permissions section: Required permissions The following permissions are required to manage a private services access connection: compute.addresses.create compute.addresses.list compute.globalAddresses.create compute.globalAddresses.createInternal compute.globalAddresses.list compute.networks.list compute.networks.use servicenetworking.services.addPeering serviceusage.services.list You might also be able to get these permissions with custom roles or other predefined roles .
- Home Documentation Databases Cloud SQL PostgreSQL Guides Send feedback Configure private services access Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
- If you see an error about either the compute.globalAddresses.list permission or the compute.projects.get permission for the project, run this gcloud command: gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding HOST PROJECT NAME \ --member = serviceAccount:service- HOST PROJECT NUMBER @service-networking.iam.gserviceaccount.com \ --role = roles/servicenetworking.serviceAgent Change the private service access configuration You can change the allocated address range of a private service connection without modifying any existing Cloud SQL instances.
- Configure private services access for Cloud SQL Important: When you create a private connection between your VPC network and the Cloud SQL service, it becomes available for use by any Google service that supports private services access.

Evidence snippets:
- For more information, see Configure both private services access and Private Service Connect . gcloud To create an instance with Private Service Connect enabled for the instance, use the gcloud sql instances create command: gcloud sql instances create INSTANCE NAME \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --region = REGION NAME \ --enable-private-service-connect \ --allowed-psc-projects = ALLOWED PROJECTS \ --availability-type = AVAILABILITY TYPE \ --no-assign-ip \ --tier = MACHINE TYPE \ --database-version = DATABASE VERSION Make the following replacements: INSTANCE NAME : the name of the instance.
