Evidence snippets:
- Some locations including global and nam-eur-asia1 aren't available for Cloud EKM.
- Compatibility Supported key managers You can store external keys in the following external key management partner systems: Supported today: Fortanix Futurex Thales Services that support CMEK with Cloud EKM The following services support integration with Cloud KMS for external (Cloud EKM) keys: Agent Assist AlloyDB for PostgreSQL Apigee API hub Application Integration Artifact Registry Backup and DR Service: Backup Vault Container and Backups at rest Backup for GKE BigQuery Bigtable Cloud Composer Cloud Data Fusion Cloud Healthcare API Cloud Logging: Data in the Log Router and Data in Logging storage Cloud Run Cloud Run functions Cloud SQL Cloud Storage Cloud Tasks Cloud Workstations Compute Engine: Persistent disks , Snapshots , Custom images , and Machine images Customer Experience Insights Database Migration Service: MySQL migrations - data written to databases , PostgreSQL migrations - Data written to databases , PostgreSQL to AlloyDB migrations - Data written to databases , SQL Server migrations - Data written to databases , and Oracle to PostgreSQL data at rest Dataflow Dataform Dataplex Universal Catalog Dataproc Metastore Datastream Dialogflow CX Document AI Eventarc Advanced ( Preview ) Eventarc Standard Filestore Firestore Google Cloud Managed Lustre Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka Google Cloud NetApp Volumes Google Distributed Cloud Google Kubernetes Engine: Data on VM disks and Application-layer secrets Integration Connectors Looker (Google Cloud core) Managed Service for Apache Spark: Dataproc clusters data on VM disks and Dataproc serverless data on VM disks Memorystore for Redis Memorystore for Redis Cluster Memorystore for Valkey Migrate to Virtual Machines: Data migrated from VMware, AWS, and Azure VM sources and Data migrated from disk and machine image sources Parameter Manager Pub/Sub Secret Manager Secure Source Manager Security Command Center Spanner Speech-to-Text Vertex AI Vertex AI Workbench instances Workflows Workload Manager Important: All other services are not compatible with Cloud External Key Manager for CMEK.
- Considerations When you use a Cloud EKM key, Google has no control over the availability of your externally managed key in the external key management partner system.
- Cloud EKM over the internet: available in most Google Cloud locations where Cloud KMS is available, including regional and multi-regional locations.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For guidance about how Google Cloud services can help meet the requirements of different compliance frameworks, see the following resources: Protecting healthcare data on Google Cloud Cloud Compliance & Regulations Resources Google Cloud FedRAMP implementation guide PCI Data Security Standard compliance Summary of best practices The following table summarizes the best practices recommended in this document: Topic Task Decide whether to use CMEK Use CMEK if you require any of the capabilities enabled by CMEK .
- If you want to follow a different granularity strategy, consider the following trade-offs of different patterns: High granularity keys —for example, one key for each individual resource More control to safely disable key versions: Disabling or destroying a key version that is used for a narrow scope has lower risk of affecting other resources than disabling or destroying a shared key.
- The following table lists which IAM roles are typically associated with which job function: IAM role Description NIST SP 800-152 designation roles/cloudkms.admin Provides access to Cloud KMS resources, except for access to restricted resource types and cryptographic operations.
- For most organizations, this strategy provides a good balance between the overhead of maintaining many highly granular keys and the potential risks of using less granular keys that are shared between many projects, services, or resources.

- To create an EKM connection for manually managed external keys, run the following command: curl "https://cloudkms.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /ekmConnections" \ --request "POST" \ --header "authorization: Bearer TOKEN " \ --header "content-type: application/json" \ --header "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT ID " \ --data '{ "name": " EKM CONNECTION ", "serviceResolvers": [ { "serviceDirectoryService": " SERVICE DIRECTORY SERVICE ", "hostname": " HOSTNAME ", "serverCertificates": [ { SERVER CERTIFICATES } ] } ] }' Replace the following: PROJECT ID : the ID of the project where you want to create the EKM connection.
- This information is also visible each time you use the Google Cloud console to create a Cloud EKM key. service- PROJECT NUMBER @gcp-sa-ekms.iam.gserviceaccount.com Ensure gcloud CLI is up to date If you're going to use the Google Cloud CLI, ensure that it's up-to-date with the following command: gcloud CLI gcloud components update Prepare a VPC network There are two options when setting up a VPC network: Auto mode network Custom mode network By default, new projects contain an auto mode network that is pre-populated with firewall rules .
- API To set the default EKM connection for a location, use the EkmConfig.patch method: curl "https://cloudkms.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /ekmConfig" \ --request "PATCH" \ --header "authorization: Bearer TOKEN " \ --header "content-type: application/json" \ --data '{"defaultEkmConnection": "projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ LOCATION /ekmConnections/ DEFAULT EKM CONNECTION "}' Replace the following: PROJECT ID : the ID of the project for which you want to set a default EKM connection.
