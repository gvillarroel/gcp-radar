- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Operational overhead: Using highly granular keys might require administrative effort or additional tooling for automation to provision a large number of Cloud KMS resources and to manage access controls for service agents so they can only use the appropriate keys.
- Monitor key usage You can view key usage with the Cloud KMS inventory API to help you identify Google Cloud resources in your organization that are dependent on and protected by Cloud KMS keys.
- This dashboard can be used to monitor the state, usage, and availability of your key versions and corresponding resources they protect.
- Multi-region resources can't use a regional key ring.
