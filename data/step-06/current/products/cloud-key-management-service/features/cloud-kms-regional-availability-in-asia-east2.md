Evidence snippets:
- Operational overhead: Using highly granular keys might require administrative effort or additional tooling for automation to provision a large number of Cloud KMS resources and to manage access controls for service agents so they can only use the appropriate keys.
- Monitor key usage You can view key usage with the Cloud KMS inventory API to help you identify Google Cloud resources in your organization that are dependent on and protected by Cloud KMS keys.
- This dashboard can be used to monitor the state, usage, and availability of your key versions and corresponding resources they protect.
- Multi-region resources can't use a regional key ring.

- EKM key management from Cloud KMS When using Cloud EKM through a VPC with an external key management partner that supports the Cloud EKM control plane, you can use the Cloud KMS EKM management mode to simplify the process of maintaining external keys in your external key management partner and in Cloud EKM.
- With EKM key management from Cloud KMS enabled, Cloud EKM can request the following changes in your EKM: Create a key: When you create an externally managed key in Cloud KMS using a compatible EKM connection, Cloud EKM sends your key creation request to your EKM.
- The following metrics can help you understand your EKM usage: cloudkms.googleapis.com/ekm/external/request latencies cloudkms.googleapis.com/ekm/external/request count For more information about these metrics, see cloudkms metrics .
