Evidence snippets:
- This page shows you how to use Organization Policy Service custom constraints to restrict specific operations on the following Google Cloud resources: cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Project cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/Folder To learn more about Organization Policy, see Custom organization policies .
- Test the policy Create a project with project ID sampleDemoProject in the organization: gcloud projects create sampleDemoProject \ --organization = ORGANIZATION ID The output is the following: PERMISSION DENIED: The caller does not have permission Example custom organization policies for common use cases This table provides syntax examples for some common custom constraints.
- As the organization policy administrator , you can define an organization policy, which is a set of restrictions called constraints that apply to Google Cloud resources and descendants of those resources in the Google Cloud resource hierarchy .
- However, if you want more granular, customizable control over the specific fields that are restricted in your organization policies, you can also create custom constraints and use those custom constraints in an organization policy.
