- When you enforce mandatory tags, you can only create resources that comply with your organization's tagging policies; that is, resources are bound with the tag values for the mandatory tag keys specified in the policy.
- The following table lists some of the differences between tags and labels: Tags Labels Resource structure Tag keys, tag values, and tag bindings are all discrete resources Not a resource in itself, but metadata for resources Definition Defined at the organization or project level Defined by each resource Access control Management and attachment of tags requires Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles Attachment of labels requires IAM roles , which vary based on the service resource Prerequisite for attachment The tag key and tag value must be defined before a tag can be attached to a resource No prerequisites for attachment Inheritance Tag bindings are inherited by children of the resource in the Google Cloud hierarchy Not inherited by children of the resource Deletion requirements Tags can't be deleted unless no tag bindings for that tag exist Can be removed from a resource at any time Naming requirements Requirements for tag values and tag keys Requirements for labels Key-value name length 256 characters maximum 63 characters maximum Allow and deny policy support Tags can be referenced by allow policy conditions and deny policy conditions No allow and deny policy support Organization policy support Tags on some resources can be referenced by organization policy conditional constraints No organization policy support Cloud Billing integration Perform chargebacks, audits, and other cost allocation analysis, export Cloud Billing cost data to BigQuery Filter resources by label in Cloud Billing, export Cloud Billing data to BigQuery For more information about labels, see Creating and managing labels .
