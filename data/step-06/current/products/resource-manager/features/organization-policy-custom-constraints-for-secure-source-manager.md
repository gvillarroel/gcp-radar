- This page shows you how to use Organization Policy Service custom constraints to restrict specific operations on the following Google Cloud resources: essentialcontacts.googleapis.com/Contact To learn more about Organization Policy, see Custom organization policies .
- Test the policy Try creating a contact for a different category: gcloud essential-contacts create --email = randomemail@example.com --language = en --notification-categories = security The output is similar to the following: (gcloud.essential-contacts.create) FAILED PRECONDITION: Precondition check failed. - '@type': type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.ErrorInfo domain: iam.googleapis.com metadata: customConstraints: customConstraints/custom.onlyTechnicalNotificationsAllowed reason: CUSTOM ORG POLICY VIOLATION - '@type': type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.DebugInfo detail: '[ORIGINAL ERROR] generic::failed precondition: com.google.apps.framework.auth.IamFailedPreconditionException: Operation denied by custom org policy: ["customConstraints/custom.onlyTechnicalNotificationsAllowed": "The contact can only be subscribed to technical notifications."].

- Before you begin, you need to know the following: Your organization ID A project ID Create the constraint Save the following file as constraint-technical-notification.yaml : name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/custom.onlyTechnicalNotificationsAllowed resourceTypes : - essentialcontacts.googleapis.com/TechnicalNotifications methodTypes : - CREATE - UPDATE condition : "resource.notificationCategorySubscriptions \ [0 \ ] == 'TECHNICAL' && resource.notificationCategorySubscriptions.size()==1" actionType : ALLOW displayName : TechnicalNotifications description : The contact can only be subscribed to technical notifications.
- When you have entered a value into each field, the equivalent YAML configuration for this custom constraint appears on the right. gcloud To create a custom constraint, create a YAML file using the following format: name : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /customConstraints/ CONSTRAINT NAME resourceTypes : RESOURCE NAME methodTypes : - CREATE - UPDATE condition : " CONDITION " actionType : ACTION displayName : DISPLAY NAME description : DESCRIPTION Replace the following: ORGANIZATION ID : your organization ID, such as 123456789 .
