Evidence snippets:
- Enter the following query and click Run query : severity>=DEBUG log id("GCEGuestAgentManager") "The agent config file is not valid" Linux Run the following command on the Linux Compute Engine VM: journalctl -u google-guest-agent-manager grep "The agent config file is not valid" Windows Run the following command on the Windows Compute Engine VM: Get-Eventlog -Source google guest agent manager -LogName Application Where-Object {$ .Message -like " The agent config file is not valid "} If you see logs containing the string The agent config file is not valid , then the custom configuration for the Ops Agent you provided when creating or updating the extension policy is invalid.
- Troubleshoot extension policies This section provides information about troubleshooting the use of extension policies to manage the Ops Agent: gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies commands fail The extension policy is created, but the Ops Agent status is "not detected" Linux systemctl and Windows Service Manager don't work with the Ops Agent For information about troubleshooting the Ops Agent, see Troubleshoot the Ops Agent . gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies commands fail When a gcloud beta compute zone-vm-extension-policies command fails, the response includes troubleshooting suggestions.
- Enter the following query and click Run query : log id("GCEGuestAgentManager") Linux Run the following command on the Compute Engine VM: journalctl -u google-guest-agent-manager Windows Run the following command on the Compute Engine VM: Get-Eventlog -Source google guest agent manager -LogName Application If you see logs containing a string like Failed to install plugin "ops-agent-plugin" ... , or the query returns no logs, then the extension policy failed to install the Ops Agent.
- Enable the APIs Grant roles required to use the Ops Agent To get the permissions that you need to use the Ops Agent to write logs and metrics, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your service account: To write logs: Logging Logs Writer ( roles/logging.logWriter ) To write metrics: Monitoring Metric Writer ( roles/monitoring.metricWriter ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .

Evidence snippets:
- The Ops Agent collects logs and metrics on Compute Engine instances, sending your logs to Cloud Logging and your metrics to Cloud Monitoring.

Evidence snippets:
- For more information about the metrics collected, see Metrics ingested by the receivers . logging : receivers : syslog : type : files include paths : - /var/log/messages - /var/log/syslog service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ syslog ] metrics : receivers : hostmetrics : type : hostmetrics collection interval : 60s processors : metrics filter : type : exclude metrics metrics pattern : [] service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ hostmetrics ] processors : [ metrics filter ] Windows By default, the Ops Agent collects Windows event logs from System , Application , and Security channels, as well as host metrics, IIS metrics, and SQL Server metrics.
- This can be used to remove placeholder values, such as: httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : httpRequest.referer = "-" Sample Configurations The parse json processor would transform a JSON file containing { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } into a LogEntry structure that looks like this: { "jsonPayload" : { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } } This could then be transformed with modify fields into this LogEntry : { "httpRequest" : { "status" : 400 , "requestUrl" : "/index.html" , } } by using this Ops Agent configuration: logging : receivers : in : type : files include paths : - /var/log/http.json processors : parse json : type : parse json set http request : type : modify fields fields : httpRequest.status : move from : jsonPayload.http status type : integer httpRequest.requestUrl : move from : jsonPayload.path httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : jsonPayload.referer = "-" service : pipelines : pipeline : receivers : [ in ] processors : [ parse json , set http request ] This configuration reads JSON-formatted logs from /var/log/http.json and populates part of the httpRequest structure from fields in the logs.
- This processor supplies an empty metrics pattern value, so it doesn't exclude any metrics. processors : metrics filter : type : exclude metrics metrics pattern : [] To disable the collection of all process metrics by the Ops Agent, add the following to your config.yaml file: metrics: processors: metrics filter: type: exclude metrics metrics pattern: - agent.googleapis.com/processes/ This excludes process metrics from collection in the metrics filter processor that applies to the default pipeline in the metrics service.
- Metrics service The metrics service customizes verbosity for the Ops Agent metrics module's own logs and links metrics receivers and processors together into pipelines.
