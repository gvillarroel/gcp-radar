- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- To perform aggregate operations on your log entries, like counting the number of log entries that contain a specific pattern, upgrade the log bucket to use Observability Analytics, and then run queries from the Observability Analytics page of the Google Cloud console.
- Analyze results by using Observability Analytics You can aggregate, analyze, and chart your log data by using SQL queries in the Observability Analytics page when your project contains log buckets that are upgraded to use Observability Analytics.
- For information about using SQL to write queries, see Query and view logs in Observability Analytics .
- For more information about investigations, see the following documentation: Troubleshoot issues with Gemini Cloud Assist investigations Create a Gemini Cloud Assist investigation Manage Gemini Cloud Assist investigations View similar log entries You can view log entries that are similar to a selected log entry, which lets you focus on logs of interest.
