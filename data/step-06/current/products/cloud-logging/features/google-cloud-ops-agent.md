- The entire metrics configuration looks like the following: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [] The following example shows the built-in service configuration for Windows: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : - hostmetrics - iis - mssql processors : - metrics filter The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics submodule to be debug instead: metrics : service : log level : debug Collection of self logs By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
- To disable self-log collection, add a global section to your user-specified configuration file and set the default self log file collection option to the value false : logging: ... metrics: ... global: default self log file collection: false Log-rotation configuration Starting with Ops Agent version 2.31.0, you can also set up the agent's log-rotation feature by using the configuration files.

Evidence snippets:
- Enable the APIs Grant roles required to use the Ops Agent To get the permissions that you need to use the Ops Agent to write logs and metrics, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your service account: To write logs: Logging Logs Writer ( roles/logging.logWriter ) To write metrics: Monitoring Metric Writer ( roles/monitoring.metricWriter ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .

- Verify that the Ops Agent is collecting telemetry If the Ops Agent has been successfully installed and is running correctly, then it sends metrics to Cloud Monitoring and logs to Cloud Logging.
- Enable the APIs required to use the Ops Agent To use the Ops Agent to write logs and metrics, you must enable the Cloud Logging API and Cloud Monitoring API on your Google Cloud project.
