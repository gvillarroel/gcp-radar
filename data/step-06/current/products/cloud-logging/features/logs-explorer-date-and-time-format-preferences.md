- Enable the APIs Grant roles required to use the Ops Agent To get the permissions that you need to use the Ops Agent to write logs and metrics, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your service account: To write logs: Logging Logs Writer ( roles/logging.logWriter ) To write metrics: Monitoring Metric Writer ( roles/monitoring.metricWriter ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- For example, suppose you created and rolled out a global policy by using the following command: gcloud beta compute global-vm-extension-policies create POLICY NAME \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --extensions=ops-agent \ --version=ops-agent=2.61.0 \ --rollout-predefined-plan=slow rollout \ --config-from-file=ops-agent="/usr/ops-agent-config.yaml" To extend the policy to VMs created in previously unused zones, restart the rollout by using the following command: gcloud beta compute global-vm-extension-policies update test-policy POLICY NAME \ --project= PROJECT ID \ --extensions=ops-agent \ --version=ops-agent=2.61.0 \ --rollout-predefined-plan=slow rollout \ --config-from-file=ops-agent="/usr/ops-agent-config.yaml" \ --rollout-retry-uuid= UUID Replace the following variables in the command: POLICY NAME : A name for the VM extension policy.
- Grant roles required to use VM Extension Manager To get the permissions that you need to create, view, modify, and delete VM extension policies, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project: To create extension policies: VM Extension Policy Admin ( roles/compute.vmExtensionPolicyAdmin ) To view extension policies: VM Extension Policy Viewer ( roles/compute.vmExtensionPolicyViewer ) VM Extension Policy Admin ( roles/compute.vmExtensionPolicyAdmin ) To modify extension policies: VM Extension Policy Admin ( roles/compute.vmExtensionPolicyAdmin ) To delete extension policies: VM Extension Policy Admin ( roles/compute.vmExtensionPolicyAdmin ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .

Evidence snippets:
- For example, to retrieve and display the log entries with a resource type of global , run the following command: gcloud logging read "resource.type=global" The command returns a result similar to the following: --- insertId : jpj9zjf73t1mn jsonPayload : message : My second entry weather : partly cloudy logName : projects / myloggingproject / logs / my - test - log receiveTimestamp : '2018-11-01T18:39:31.114507977Z' resource : labels : project id : myloggingproject type : global timestamp : '2018-11-01T18:39:31.114507977Z' --- insertId : vd4m1if7h7u1a logName : projects / myloggingproject / logs / my - test - log receiveTimestamp : '2018-11-01T18:39:19.718100792Z' resource : labels : project id : myloggingproject type : global textPayload : A simple entry timestamp : '2018-11-01T18:39:19.718100792Z' For information about reading logs, see the gcloud logging read reference documentation.
- To read a list of log entries from Logging, do the following: Go to the API reference page for the entries.list API method: Go to entries.list API page Configure and run the API command: Replace PROJECT ID in the following text: "resourceNames": [ "projects/ PROJECT ID " ], "filter": "resource.type=global", "orderBy": "timestamp desc" Copy the updated text from the previous step, and paste it into the Request body field of APIs Explorer.
- The method returns a response similar to the following: { "entries": [ { "textPayload": "A simple entry", "insertId": "vd4m1if7h7u1a", "resource": { "type": "global", "labels": { "project id": "myloggingproject" } }, "timestamp": "2018-11-01T18:39:19.718100792Z", "logName": "projects/myloggingproject/logs/my-test-log", "receiveTimestamp": "2018-11-01T18:39:19.718100792Z" }, { "insertId": "jpj9zjf73t1mn", "jsonPayload": { "message": "My second entry", "weather": "partly cloudy" }, "resource": { "type": "global", "labels": { "project id": "myloggingproject" } }, "timestamp": "2018-11-01T18:39:31.114507977Z", "logName": "projects/myloggingproject/logs/my-test-log", "receiveTimestamp": "2018-11-01T18:39:31.114507977Z" } ] } View log entries in the Logs Explorer To view log entries in the Google Cloud console, you can use the Logs Explorer.
