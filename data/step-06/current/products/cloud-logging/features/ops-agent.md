- Source ID: `site-docs-root-2`
- Final score: 258
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Enter the following query and click Run query : severity>=DEBUG log id("GCEGuestAgentManager") "The agent config file is not valid" Linux Run the following command on the Linux Compute Engine VM: journalctl -u google-guest-agent-manager grep "The agent config file is not valid" Windows Run the following command on the Windows Compute Engine VM: Get-Eventlog -Source google guest agent manager -LogName Application Where-Object {$ .Message -like " The agent config file is not valid "} If you see logs containing the string The agent config file is not valid , then the custom configuration for the Ops Agent you provided when creating or updating the extension policy is invalid.
- Verify the installation of the Ops Agent This section describes how to do the following: Verify the status or version of an Ops Agent installation Verify that the Ops Agent is collecting telemetry Verify the status or version of an Ops Agent installation To determine the status or version of the Ops Agent, use one of the following Google Cloud console pages: Compute Engine In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page: Go to VM instances If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Compute Engine .
- Enter the following query and click Run query : log id("GCEGuestAgentManager") Linux Run the following command on the Compute Engine VM: journalctl -u google-guest-agent-manager Windows Run the following command on the Compute Engine VM: Get-Eventlog -Source google guest agent manager -LogName Application If you see logs containing a string like Failed to install plugin "ops-agent-plugin" ... , or the query returns no logs, then the extension policy failed to install the Ops Agent.
- Verify that the Ops Agent is collecting telemetry If the Ops Agent has been successfully installed and is running correctly, then it sends metrics to Cloud Monitoring and logs to Cloud Logging.
