Evidence snippets:
- JSON example: { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } YAML example: bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the IAM documentation .
- For example, if the bindings grant 50 different roles to user:alice@example.com , and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the bindings in the Policy . etag string ( bytes format) etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
- To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation . bindings[] object ( Binding ) Associates a list of members , or principals, with a role .
- Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3 .

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 70
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- If you don't add a condition to this role, then the principal has access to all log views on all user-defined log buckets in the Google Cloud project.
- In the Select a role menu, select Logs Views Accessor .
- Before you begin Ensure the following: To get the permissions that you need to configure an aggregated sink, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your organization: To create log buckets and sinks in a project: Logs Configuration Writer ( roles/logging.configWriter ) - your project To create an aggregated sink: Logs Configuration Writer ( roles/logging.configWriter ) - your organization To grant roles to principals: Owner ( roles/owner ) - your project For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- In the following steps, you grant a principal the role of roles/logging.viewAccessor along with an IAM condition that restricts the grant to the view named AllLogs : In the Google Cloud console, go to the IAM page: Go to IAM If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is IAM & Admin .
