- The entire metrics configuration looks like the following: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [] The following example shows the built-in service configuration for Windows: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : - hostmetrics - iis - mssql processors : - metrics filter The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics submodule to be debug instead: metrics : service : log level : debug Collection of self logs By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
- This processor supplies an empty metrics pattern value, so it doesn't exclude any metrics. processors : metrics filter : type : exclude metrics metrics pattern : [] To disable the collection of all process metrics by the Ops Agent, add the following to your config.yaml file: metrics: processors: metrics filter: type: exclude metrics metrics pattern: - agent.googleapis.com/processes/ This excludes process metrics from collection in the metrics filter processor that applies to the default pipeline in the metrics service.
