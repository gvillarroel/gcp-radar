Evidence snippets:
- You might also be able to get the required permissions through custom roles or other predefined roles .
- Clean up To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used on this page, delete the Google Cloud project with the resources. (Optional) To delete the log entries you created, run the following gcloud command: gcloud logging logs delete my-test-log If you don't delete your log entries, then they expire and are removed.
- For example, if a Compute Engine VM instance is configured with the default API settings, then the list command completes with a permission denied error: ERROR: (gcloud.logging.read) PERMISSION DENIED: Request had insufficient authentication scopes.
- Write a log entry with unstructured data to the log my-test-log , run the gcloud logging write command: gcloud logging write my - test - log "A simple entry." After the command completes, you see the message: Created log entry .
