Evidence snippets:
- For more information about the metrics collected, see Metrics ingested by the receivers . logging : receivers : syslog : type : files include paths : - /var/log/messages - /var/log/syslog service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ syslog ] metrics : receivers : hostmetrics : type : hostmetrics collection interval : 60s processors : metrics filter : type : exclude metrics metrics pattern : [] service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ hostmetrics ] processors : [ metrics filter ] Windows By default, the Ops Agent collects Windows event logs from System , Application , and Security channels, as well as host metrics, IIS metrics, and SQL Server metrics.
- This can be used to remove placeholder values, such as: httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : httpRequest.referer = "-" Sample Configurations The parse json processor would transform a JSON file containing { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } into a LogEntry structure that looks like this: { "jsonPayload" : { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } } This could then be transformed with modify fields into this LogEntry : { "httpRequest" : { "status" : 400 , "requestUrl" : "/index.html" , } } by using this Ops Agent configuration: logging : receivers : in : type : files include paths : - /var/log/http.json processors : parse json : type : parse json set http request : type : modify fields fields : httpRequest.status : move from : jsonPayload.http status type : integer httpRequest.requestUrl : move from : jsonPayload.path httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : jsonPayload.referer = "-" service : pipelines : pipeline : receivers : [ in ] processors : [ parse json , set http request ] This configuration reads JSON-formatted logs from /var/log/http.json and populates part of the httpRequest structure from fields in the logs.
- The entire metrics configuration looks like the following: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [] The following example shows the built-in service configuration for Windows: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : - hostmetrics - iis - mssql processors : - metrics filter The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics submodule to be debug instead: metrics : service : log level : debug Collection of self logs By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
- To disable self-log collection, add a global section to your user-specified configuration file and set the default self log file collection option to the value false : logging: ... metrics: ... global: default self log file collection: false Log-rotation configuration Starting with Ops Agent version 2.31.0, you can also set up the agent's log-rotation feature by using the configuration files.

### "Install and manage the Ops Agent by using VM Extension Manager policies\

- Final score: 212
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Verify that the Ops Agent is collecting telemetry If the Ops Agent has been successfully installed and is running correctly, then it sends metrics to Cloud Monitoring and logs to Cloud Logging.
- When the Ops Agent has been installed on the VM and is collecting logs and metrics, the agent's status is marked with a green checkmark next to the Ops Agent label.
- Running the Ops Agent and the legacy agents on the same VM can cause ingestion of duplicate logs or conflicts in metrics ingestion.
- Enter the following query and click Run query : severity>=DEBUG log id("GCEGuestAgentManager") "The agent config file is not valid" Linux Run the following command on the Linux Compute Engine VM: journalctl -u google-guest-agent-manager grep "The agent config file is not valid" Windows Run the following command on the Windows Compute Engine VM: Get-Eventlog -Source google guest agent manager -LogName Application Where-Object {$ .Message -like " The agent config file is not valid "} If you see logs containing the string The agent config file is not valid , then the custom configuration for the Ops Agent you provided when creating or updating the extension policy is invalid.

Evidence snippets:
- Detailed fields inside the LogEntry are as follows. iis access logs contain the following fields in the LogEntry : Field Type Description httpRequest.referer string Contents of the Referer header httpRequest.remoteIp string IP of the client that made the request httpRequest.requestMethod string HTTP method httpRequest.requestUrl string Request URL (typically just the path part of the URL) httpRequest.serverIp string The server's IP and port that was requested httpRequest.status number HTTP status code httpRequest.userAgent string Contents of the User-Agent header jsonPayload.sc substatus number The substatus error code jsonPayload.sc win32 status number The Windows status code jsonPayload.time taken number The length of time that the action took, in milliseconds jsonPayload.user string Authenticated username for the request timestamp string ( Timestamp ) Time the request was received Configure v1 metrics collection The Ops Agent on a Microsoft Windows VM automatically collects IIS v1 metrics.
- Example configuration The following commands create the configuration to collect and ingest telemetry for IIS: $ ErrorActionPreference = ' Stop ' This config gets merged with the built - in Ops Agent config , which already includes the v1 receiver in the default pipeline .
- Configure the Ops Agent for IIS Following the guide to configure the Ops Agent , add the required elements to collect telemetry from IIS instances, and restart the agent .
- What is monitored Starting with version 2.15.0, the Ops Agent can collect two different sets of metrics: The v1 metrics: agent.googleapis.com/iis/ .
