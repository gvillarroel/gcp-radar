- The entire metrics configuration looks like the following: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [] The following example shows the built-in service configuration for Windows: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : - hostmetrics - iis - mssql processors : - metrics filter The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics submodule to be debug instead: metrics : service : log level : debug Collection of self logs By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
- The valid types are: files : Collect logs by tailing files on disk. fluent forward (Ops Agent versions 2.12.0 and later): Collect logs sent via the Fluent Forward protocol over TCP. tcp (Ops Agent versions 2.3.0 and later): Collect logs in JSON format by listening to a TCP port.

Evidence snippets:
- To enable the APIs, grant the necessary roles to the default service account, and enable the OS Config metadata for a project, run the script as follows: bash set-permissions.sh --project= PROJECT ID To additionally grant one of the OS Config roles to a user who does not have the Owner ( roles/owner ) role on the project, run the script as follows: bash set-permissions.sh --project= PROJECT ID \ --iam-user= USER EMAIL \ --iam-permission-role=guestPolicy [Admin Editor Viewer] To additionally grant one of the OS Config roles to a non-default service account, run the script as follows: bash set-permissions.sh --project= PROJECT ID \ --iam-service-account= SERVICE ACCT EMAIL \ --iam-permission-role=guestPolicy [Admin Editor Viewer] The diagnose.sh script Given a project ID, a Compute Engine instance ID, and the agent policy ID, the diagnose.sh script automatically collects the necessary information to help diagnose issues with the policy: The OS Config agent version The underlying OS Config guest policy The policies that are applicable to this Compute Engine instance The agent package repositories that are pulled on to this Compute Engine instance To invoke the script, run the following command: bash diagnose.sh --project-id= PROJECT ID \ --gce-instance-id= INSTANCE ID \ --policy-id= POLICY ID Terraform integration To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see Basic Terraform commands .
- To verify that the OS Config metadata is enabled, you can run the following command: gcloud compute project-info describe \ --project PROJECT ID \ grep "enable-osconfig\ enable-guest-attributes" -A 1 The expected output follows: - key: enable-guest-attributes value: 'TRUE' - key: enable-osconfig value: 'TRUE' Observability agents are installed, but not functioning properly For information about debugging specific agents, see the following documents: Troubleshoot the Ops Agent Troubleshoot the legacy Logging agent Troubleshoot the legacy Monitoring agent Enable debug-level logs for the OS Config agent It can be useful to enable debug-level logging in the OS Config agent when reporting an issue.
- To view OS Config agent logs in Logs Explorer , use the following filter: resource . type = "gce instance" logId ( OSConfigAgent ) To view OS Config agent logs, do the following: CentOS, RHEL, SLES, SUSE Run the following command: gcloud compute ssh INSTANCE ID \ --project PROJECT ID \ -- sudo cat /var/log/messages \ grep "OSConfigAgent\ google-fluentd\ stackdriver-agent" Debian, Ubuntu Run the following command: gcloud compute ssh INSTANCE ID \ --project PROJECT ID \ -- sudo cat /var/log/syslog \ grep "OSConfigAgent\ google-fluentd\ stackdriver-agent" Windows Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
- Grant the Identity and Access Management roles Logs Writer ( roles/logging.logWriter ) and Monitoring Metric Writer ( roles/monitoring.metricWriter ) to the Compute Engine default service account so that the agents can write logs and metrics to the Logging and Cloud Monitoring APIs.

Evidence snippets:
- Detailed fields inside the LogEntry are as follows. iis access logs contain the following fields in the LogEntry : Field Type Description httpRequest.referer string Contents of the Referer header httpRequest.remoteIp string IP of the client that made the request httpRequest.requestMethod string HTTP method httpRequest.requestUrl string Request URL (typically just the path part of the URL) httpRequest.serverIp string The server's IP and port that was requested httpRequest.status number HTTP status code httpRequest.userAgent string Contents of the User-Agent header jsonPayload.sc substatus number The substatus error code jsonPayload.sc win32 status number The Windows status code jsonPayload.time taken number The length of time that the action took, in milliseconds jsonPayload.user string Authenticated username for the request timestamp string ( Timestamp ) Time the request was received Configure v1 metrics collection The Ops Agent on a Microsoft Windows VM automatically collects IIS v1 metrics.
- Any dashboards are automatically installed after you configure the integration and the Ops Agent has begun collecting metric data.
- The integration also collects information from access logs.
- The following table shows the mapping of v1 metrics to v2 metrics: v1 metric ( agent.googleapis.com/iis/ ) v2 metric ( workload.googleapis.com/ ) current connections iis.connection.active network/transferred bytes count iis.network.io new connection count iis.connection.attempt.count request count iis.request.count Prerequisites To collect IIS telemetry, you must install the Ops Agent : For metrics v1, install version 1.0.0 or higher.
