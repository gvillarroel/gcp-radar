Evidence snippets:
- By default, user-defined log-based metrics are calculated from all logs received by the Logging API for the Google Cloud project, regardless of any inclusion filters or exclusion filters that might apply to the Google Cloud project.
- In Cloud Monitoring, log-based metrics use the following naming patterns: System: logging.googleapis.com/ SYSTEM METRIC NAME User-defined: logging.googleapis.com/user/ USER METRIC NAME Note that user-defined log-based metrics include the string user .
- Sources of log-based metrics You can use the metrics defined by Cloud Logging to collect general usage information, and you can define your own log-based metric to capture information specific to your application or business.
- Bucket-scoped log-based metrics are useful when you use aggregated sinks to route log entries to a log bucket, and when you route log entries from one project to a log bucket in another project.

Evidence snippets:
- Examples Update the destination of a project sink: gcloud logging sinks update PROJECT ID storage.googleapis.com/my-second-gcs-bucket Deleting sinks Use the gcloud logging sinks delete command, corresponding to the API method projects.sinks.delete : You stop routing its log entries when you delete a sink: gcloud logging sinks delete SINK NAME Examples Delete sink syslog-sink-1 in the current project: gcloud logging sinks delete syslog-sink-1 Log-based metrics To manage log-based metrics, use the gcloud logging metrics command group, corresponding to the API methods at projects.metrics .
