- The entire metrics configuration looks like the following: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [] The following example shows the built-in service configuration for Windows: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : - hostmetrics - iis - mssql processors : - metrics filter The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics submodule to be debug instead: metrics : service : log level : debug Collection of self logs By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
