Evidence snippets:
- The Ops Agent, which combines the collection of metrics and logging into a single agent, is the eventual replacement for the legacy agents.
- If the Ops Agent doesn't support your use case, then you can still use the Logging agent.
- This sets the http proxy and https proxy environment variables so that the agent can send data using outbound HTTPS: setx http proxy http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx https proxy http:// proxy-ip : proxy-port /m setx no proxy 169.254.169.254 /m Determine the agent version To determine the version of the Logging agent on your system, run the following commands on your VM instance: DEBIAN / UBUNTU Run the following command on Debian or Ubuntu: dpkg-query --show --showformat ' ${ Package } ${ Version } ${ Architecture } ${ Status } \n' google-fluentd google-fluentd-catch-all-config google-fluentd-catch-all-config-structured SLES / SUSE Run the following command on SUSE: rpm --query --queryformat '%{NAME} %{VERSION} %{RELEASE} %{ARCH}\n' google-fluentd google-fluentd-catch-all-config google-fluentd-catch-all-config-structured WINDOWS Connect to your instance using RDP or a similar tool and login to Windows.
- Run the following PowerShell commands: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/windows/StackdriverLogging-v1-22.exe", "${env:UserProfile}\StackdriverLogging-v1-22.exe") & "${env:UserProfile}\StackdriverLogging-v1-22.exe" Alternatively, you can browse to the following URL to download and run the agent's installer: https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/windows/StackdriverLogging-v1-22.exe Caution: You must download the installer to a non-system directory, such as C:\Users\[USERNAME] .
