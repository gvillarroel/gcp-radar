Evidence snippets:
- For more information about the metrics collected, see Metrics ingested by the receivers . logging : receivers : syslog : type : files include paths : - /var/log/messages - /var/log/syslog service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ syslog ] metrics : receivers : hostmetrics : type : hostmetrics collection interval : 60s processors : metrics filter : type : exclude metrics metrics pattern : [] service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [ hostmetrics ] processors : [ metrics filter ] Windows By default, the Ops Agent collects Windows event logs from System , Application , and Security channels, as well as host metrics, IIS metrics, and SQL Server metrics.
- The entire metrics configuration looks like the following: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : [] The following example shows the built-in service configuration for Windows: metrics : service : pipelines : default pipeline : receivers : - hostmetrics - iis - mssql processors : - metrics filter The following service configuration customizes log verbosity for the metrics submodule to be debug instead: metrics : service : log level : debug Collection of self logs By default, the Ops Agent's Fluent Bit self logs are sent to Cloud Logging.
- This processor supplies an empty metrics pattern value, so it doesn't exclude any metrics. processors : metrics filter : type : exclude metrics metrics pattern : [] To disable the collection of all process metrics by the Ops Agent, add the following to your config.yaml file: metrics: processors: metrics filter: type: exclude metrics metrics pattern: - agent.googleapis.com/processes/ This excludes process metrics from collection in the metrics filter processor that applies to the default pipeline in the metrics service.
- To disable self-log collection, add a global section to your user-specified configuration file and set the default self log file collection option to the value false : logging: ... metrics: ... global: default self log file collection: false Log-rotation configuration Starting with Ops Agent version 2.31.0, you can also set up the agent's log-rotation feature by using the configuration files.

Evidence snippets:
- Combining the collection of logs, metrics, and traces into a single process, the Ops Agent uses Fluent Bit for logs, which supports high-throughput logging, and the OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics and traces.
- Metrics collected include: cpu metrics disk metrics iis metrics (Windows only) interface metrics gpu metrics (Linux only) memory metrics mssql metrics (Windows only) pagefile metrics (Windows only) swap metrics network metrics processes metrics agent self metrics : Third-party application support Curated integrations for third-party application metrics , which collect common app metrics and offer sample dashboards and alert policies.

- Verify that the Ops Agent is collecting telemetry If the Ops Agent has been successfully installed and is running correctly, then it sends metrics to Cloud Monitoring and logs to Cloud Logging.
- When the Ops Agent has been installed on the VM and is collecting logs and metrics, the agent's status is marked with a green checkmark next to the Ops Agent label.
