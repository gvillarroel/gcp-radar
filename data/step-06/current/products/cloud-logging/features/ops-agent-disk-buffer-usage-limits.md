- This can be used to remove placeholder values, such as: httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : httpRequest.referer = "-" Sample Configurations The parse json processor would transform a JSON file containing { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } into a LogEntry structure that looks like this: { "jsonPayload" : { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } } This could then be transformed with modify fields into this LogEntry : { "httpRequest" : { "status" : 400 , "requestUrl" : "/index.html" , } } by using this Ops Agent configuration: logging : receivers : in : type : files include paths : - /var/log/http.json processors : parse json : type : parse json set http request : type : modify fields fields : httpRequest.status : move from : jsonPayload.http status type : integer httpRequest.requestUrl : move from : jsonPayload.path httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : jsonPayload.referer = "-" service : pipelines : pipeline : receivers : [ in ] processors : [ parse json , set http request ] This configuration reads JSON-formatted logs from /var/log/http.json and populates part of the httpRequest structure from fields in the logs.

Evidence snippets:
- This option in combination with buffer chunk limit determines the maximum disk space fluentd takes for buffering. buffer queue full action string exception Controls the buffer behavior when the buffer queue is full.
- The Logging agent uses fluentd input plugins to retrieve and pull event logs from external sources, such as files on disk, or to parse incoming log records.
- Buffer-related configuration options The following configuration options let you adjust the Logging agent's internal buffering mechanism.
- For more information, see traceSampled on the LogEntry page. "logging.googleapis.com/trace sampled": false Time-related fields In general, time-related information about a log entry is stored in the timestamp field of the LogEntry object: { insertId: "1ad8d08f-6529-47ea-832e-467f869a2da4" ... resource: {2} timestamp: "2023-10-30T16:33:15.505196Z" } When the source for a log entry is structured data, the Logging agent uses the following rules to search the fields in the jsonPayload entry for time-related information: Search for a timestamp field that is a JSON object that includes the seconds and nanos fields, representing, respectively, a signed number of seconds from the UTC epoch and a nonnegative number of fractional seconds: jsonPayload: { ... "timestamp": { "seconds": CURRENT SECONDS, "nanos": CURRENT NANOS } } If the previous search fails, then search for a pair of timestampSeconds and timestampNanos fields: jsonPayload: { ... "timestampSeconds": CURRENT SECONDS, "timestampNanos": CURRENT NANOS } If the previous search fails, then search for a time field that is a string in RFC 3339 format: jsonPayload: { ... "time": CURRENT TIME RFC3339 } When time-related information is found, the Logging agent uses that information to set the value of the LogEntry.timestamp , and it doesn't copy that information from the structured record into the LogEntry.jsonPayload object.

Evidence snippets:
- If both commands display a file, then the file denoted by GOOGLE APPLICATION CREDENTIALS is used. { "type" : "service account" , "project id" : "[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]" , "private key id" : "[YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY-ID]" , "private key" : "[YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY]" , "client email" : "[YOUR-PROJECT-NUMBER]-[YOUR-KEY]@developer.gserviceaccount.com" , "client id" : "[YOUR-CLIENT-ID]" , "auth uri" : "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth" , "token uri" : "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token" , "auth provider x509 cert url" : "{x509-cert-url}" , "client x509 cert url" : "{client-x509-cert-url}" } Discrepancies between credential configurations may cause the agent to use credentials different from what your service requires.
- Verify Compute Engine credentials For a Compute Engine VM instance to run the agent without private-key credentials, the instance must have suitable access scopes and the service account identity being used by the instance must have suitable IAM permissions.
- If these spikes are just temporary, the Logging agent buffers the logs and later catches up to eventually process them.
- So when the log throughput spikes, the agent might hit a CPU usage limit.
