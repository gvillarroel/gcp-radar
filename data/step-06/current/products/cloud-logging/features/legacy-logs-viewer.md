Evidence snippets:
- Before you begin To get the permissions that you need to use the Logs Explorer to view log entries, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: To view log entries in the Required bucket and those in the Default view on the Default bucket, or to select a log scope: Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) on your project, folder, or organization.
- To view all log entries in the Required and Default buckets: Private Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.privateLogViewer ) on your project, folder, or organization.
- Set preferences for viewing log data To customize how your logs data is presented in the query results, click the settings Preferences button, and select View , Format , or Manage summary fields : To show or hide the Timeline and Fields panes, to hide summary chips in your query results, or to change the sorting order of your logs, select View .
- The toolbar in the Query pane displays the resources searched for log entries: Project logs and Default : Log entries that originate in the selected project, folder, or organization are returned.
