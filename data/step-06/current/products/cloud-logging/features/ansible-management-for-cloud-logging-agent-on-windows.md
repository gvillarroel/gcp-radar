- This can be used to remove placeholder values, such as: httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : httpRequest.referer = "-" Sample Configurations The parse json processor would transform a JSON file containing { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } into a LogEntry structure that looks like this: { "jsonPayload" : { "http status" : "400" , "path" : "/index.html" , "referer" : "-" } } This could then be transformed with modify fields into this LogEntry : { "httpRequest" : { "status" : 400 , "requestUrl" : "/index.html" , } } by using this Ops Agent configuration: logging : receivers : in : type : files include paths : - /var/log/http.json processors : parse json : type : parse json set http request : type : modify fields fields : httpRequest.status : move from : jsonPayload.http status type : integer httpRequest.requestUrl : move from : jsonPayload.path httpRequest.referer : move from : jsonPayload.referer omit if : jsonPayload.referer = "-" service : pipelines : pipeline : receivers : [ in ] processors : [ parse json , set http request ] This configuration reads JSON-formatted logs from /var/log/http.json and populates part of the httpRequest structure from fields in the logs.

Evidence snippets:
- To send logs via the fluentd in forward plugin, read the following instructions: Execute the following command on the VM with the Logging agent installed: echo '{"code": "send-log-via-fluent-cat", "message": "This is a log from in forward plugin."}' /opt/google-fluentd/embedded/bin/fluent-cat log-via-in-forward-plugin Check the Logs Explorer to see the ingested log entry: { insertId: "1kvvmhsg1ib4689" jsonPayload: { code: "send-log-via-fluent-cat" message: "This is a log from in forward plugin." } labels: { compute.googleapis.com/resource name: "add-structured-log-resource" } logName: "projects/my-sample-project-12345/logs/log-via-in-forward-plugin" receiveTimestamp: "2018-03-21T02:11:27.981020900Z" resource: { labels: { instance id: "5351724540900470204" project id: "my-sample-project-12345" zone: "us-central1-c" } type: "gce instance" } timestamp: "2018-03-21T02:11:22.717692494Z" } Streaming structured (JSON) log records from application code You can enable connectors in various languages to send structured logs from application code; for more information, review the fluentd documentation .
- Setting labels statically If you don't have this information in the payload, and simply want to add a static metadata label called environment , add the following to your output plugin configuration in the main configuration file ( /etc/google-fluentd/google-fluentd.conf on Linux or C:\Program Files (x86)\Stackdriver\LoggingAgent\fluent.conf on Windows): Configure all sources to output to Cloud Logging <match > @type google cloud labels { "environment" : "production" } ... </match> In this case, instead of using a map to replace one label with another, we use a labels setting to attach a label with a given literal value to a log entry, regardless of whether the entry already has a label or not.

Evidence snippets:
- Metrics collected include: cpu metrics disk metrics iis metrics (Windows only) interface metrics gpu metrics (Linux only) memory metrics mssql metrics (Windows only) pagefile metrics (Windows only) swap metrics network metrics processes metrics agent self metrics : Third-party application support Curated integrations for third-party application metrics , which collect common app metrics and offer sample dashboards and alert policies.
- Combining the collection of logs, metrics, and traces into a single process, the Ops Agent uses Fluent Bit for logs, which supports high-throughput logging, and the OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics and traces.
- The Cloud Monitoring Metrics Management page provides information that can help you control the amount you spend on billable metrics without affecting observability.
- You can install the Ops Agent on Managed Service for Apache Spark clusters that use image version 2.2 and later to collect syslog logs and host metrics.
