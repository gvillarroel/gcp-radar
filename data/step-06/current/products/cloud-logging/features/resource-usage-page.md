Evidence snippets:
- Clicking this prepopulated form automatically fills the request body, but you need to supply a valid PROJECT ID in each of the log names. { "resourceNames": [ "projects/ PROJECT ID " ], "pageSize": 5, "filter": "logName : projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" } Click Execute .
- The following are the audit log names, including variables for the resource identifiers: projects / PROJECT ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Factivity projects / PROJECT ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fdata access projects / PROJECT ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fsystem event projects / PROJECT ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fpolicy folders / FOLDER ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Factivity folders / FOLDER ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fdata access folders / FOLDER ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fsystem event folders / FOLDER ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fpolicy billingAccounts / BILLING ACCOUNT ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Factivity billingAccounts / BILLING ACCOUNT ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fdata access billingAccounts / BILLING ACCOUNT ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fsystem event billingAccounts / BILLING ACCOUNT ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fpolicy organizations / ORGANIZATION ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Factivity organizations / ORGANIZATION ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fdata access organizations / ORGANIZATION ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fsystem event organizations / ORGANIZATION ID / logs / cloudaudit . googleapis . com % 2 Fpolicy Caller identities in audit logs Audit logs record the identity that performed the logged operations on the Google Cloud resource.
- To display all audit logs, enter either of the following queries into the query-editor field, and then click Run query : logName:"cloudaudit.googleapis.com" protoPayload."@type"="type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog" To display the audit logs for a specific resource and audit log type, in the Query builder pane, do the following: In Resource type , select the Google Cloud resource whose audit logs you want to see.
- Required roles To view audit logs, you must have the appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions and roles: To get the permissions that you need to get read-only access to Admin Activity, Policy Denied, and System Event audit logs, ask your administrator to grant you the Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) IAM role on your project.

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 177
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Enable the APIs Required roles To get the permissions that you need to create a Compute Engine instance, install Apache, and to view metric data, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your project: Compute Instance Admin (v1) ( roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1 ) Logs Viewer ( roles/logging.viewer ) Monitoring Editor ( roles/monitoring.editor ) OSPolicyAssignment Admin ( roles/osconfig.osPolicyAssignmentAdmin ) Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) Service Usage Admin ( roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin ) For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- Restart the Ops Agent: To restart the agent, run the following command on your instance: sudo systemctl restart google-cloud-ops-agent To confirm that the agent restarted, run the following command and verify that the components "Metrics Agent" and "Logging Agent" started: sudo systemctl status "google-cloud-ops-agent " View Apache web server logs To view your logs in the Google Cloud console, use the Logs Explorer: In the Google Cloud console, go to the segment Logs Explorer page: Go to Logs Explorer If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Logging .
- In the following expression, paste the copied ID into the PROJECT ID field, and then copy the expression into the query editor: resource.type = "gce instance" logName =( "projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/apache access" OR "projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/apache error" ) When the previous query is run, only apache access and apache error log entries are shown.
- The email notification you receive looks similar to the following: To view the new log entries, do the following: In the Google Cloud console, go to the segment Logs Explorer page: Go to Logs Explorer If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Logging .
