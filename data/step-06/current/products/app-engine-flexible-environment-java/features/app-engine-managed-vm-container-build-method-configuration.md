Evidence snippets:
- Enable billing in your new Google Cloud project by creating a new billing account or setting an existing one: Go to Billing Download and install the Google Cloud CLI and then initialize the gcloud CLI: Download the SDK Run the following gcloud command to create an App Engine application and specify in which geographical region that you want your app to run: gcloud app create Due to changes in the default behavior for how Cloud Build uses service accounts in new projects, and secure-by-default organization policy changes , you might need to grant additional roles to your deploying service account.
- Navigate to the nginx directory where the sample code is located, for example: cd appengine-custom-runtimes-samples/nginx Running Hello World on your local machine You can test the sample app by downloading and installing Docker , and then running the Hello World container on your local machine.
- Code review Hello World is the simplest possible App Engine app, as it creates a single container that runs only one service and one version.
- This Dockerfile installs the nginx web server and copies some basic configuration: The standard nginx container just runs nginx.
