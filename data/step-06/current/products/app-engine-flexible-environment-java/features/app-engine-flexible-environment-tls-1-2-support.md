- SSL certificate types App Engine supports the following certificate types: Single Domain/Hostname Self-signed Wildcard Subject Alternative Name (SAN) / Multi Domain It requires some things of your certificates and keys: Private Key and Certificate should be uploaded in PEM format.
- To obtain a certificate for use with your App Engine app: Generate your private key and a certificate signing request (CSR) by using the openssl tool: Run the following command from a directory where you want to create the server.csr file: openssl req - nodes - newkey rsa : 2048 - keyout [ MY PRIVATE KEY ] . key - out [ MY CSR ] . csr where: [MY PRIVATE KEY].key is the generated file where your private key is stored.
- To move from your own SSL certificates to Google-managed SSL certificates, or to add managed SSL certificates to an existing app with a custom domain, update your domain mapping: In the Google Cloud console, go to App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains : Go to Custom Domains Select the domain you want to secure, and click Enable managed security .

- For example: To update the default service of an App Engine app to accept traffic only from Cloud Load Balancing and VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update default --ingress = internal-and-cloud-load-balancing To update a service named "internal-requests" to accept traffic only from VPC networks that are in the same project: gcloud app services update internal-requests --ingress = internal-only Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- Accessing internal services The following considerations apply: For requests from a Shared VPC, traffic is only considered internal if the App Engine app is deployed in the Shared VPC host project.
- For example, to view the ingress settings and other information for the default service run: gcloud app services describe default Edit ingress settings Console Go to the App Engine Services page.
