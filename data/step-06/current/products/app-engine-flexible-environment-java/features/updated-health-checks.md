- Specifically, you cannot customize the 404 response page when no servlet mapping is defined for a URL, the 403 quota error page, or the 500 server error page that appears after an App Engine internal error. web.xml features not supported The following web.xml features are not supported by App Engine: App Engine supports the <load-on-startup> element for servlet declarations.
- Here is a web.xml example that maps all URL paths ( / ) to the servlet class = mysite.server.ComingSoonServlet : <web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app 3 1.xsd" version="3.1"> <servlet> <servlet-name>comingsoon</servlet-name> <servlet-class>mysite.server.ComingSoonServlet</servlet-class> </servlet> <servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>comingsoon</servlet-name> <url-pattern>/ </url-pattern> </servlet-mapping> </web-app> Servlets and URL paths web.xml defines mappings between URL paths and the servlets that handle requests with those paths.
- This file is named web.xml , and resides in the app's WAR under the WEB-INF/ directory. web.xml is part of the servlet standard for web applications.

- App Engine continues to send health check requests and restarts the instance if an unhealthy instance continues to fail to respond to a predetermined number of consecutive health checks.
- NTP with App Engine flexible environment The App Engine flexible environment has network time protocol (NTP) services which use Google NTP servers.
- As the instance goes through these health checks, the App Engine logs can indicate that the instance is in any of the following states: Healthy .

Evidence snippets:
- If your App Engine flexible environment app is not configured to use Shared VPC , the App Engine flexible environment creates up to two hidden VPC firewall rules, depending on whether your app uses split health checks (default) or legacy health checks.
- Service IP range for requests sent to the App Engine standard environment IP range for requests sent to the App Engine flexible environment App Engine Cron 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32 Compute Engine instances with external IP addresses External IP address of the instance External IP address of the instance Compute Engine instances without an external IP address 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Compute Engine instances without an external IP address using Cloud NAT for outbound connections 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Cloud Scheduler jobs using App Engine HTTP and App Engine tasks in Cloud Tasks (including App Engine Task Queues) 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.2/32 Cloud Storage or Blobstore 0.1.0.30/32 Not applicable URL Fetch 0.1.0.40/32 0.1.0.40/32 Warming requests 0.1.0.3/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny Not applicable Depending on your use case, these additional instructions might apply when configuring App Engine firewall rules: Requests from newly created or updated App Engine Cron jobs sent to either the App Engine standard or flexible environment come from 0.1.0.2 .
- Direction of traffic : Ingress Action on match : Allow Source IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 and 130.211.0.0/22 Protocols and ports : tcp : 8443 (for legacy health checks) or 10402 (for split health checks) Priority : 1000 Preventing access to cached content The App Engine firewall sits behind mechanisms that cache content, for example web proxies and browsers.
- App Engine flexible example Your app running in the flexible environment has two services: frontend service and backend service , and has a firewall configured to deny traffic by default. frontend service uses Cloud Tasks with App Engine HTTP to send messages to backend service .
