### "How requests are handled \_|\_ App Engine flexible environment \_|\_ Google\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/how-requests-are-handled](https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/how-requests-are-handled)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 97
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Avoid performing background work in your app, and review your code to make sure all asynchronous operations finish before you deliver your response.
- Handling asynchronous background work Background work is any work that your app performs for a request after you have delivered your HTTP response.
- With Cloud Tasks, HTTP requests are long-lived and return a response only after any asynchronous work ends.
- Warning: Performing asynchronous background work can result in higher billing.

### "Quickstart: Create a custom runtime app in the App Engine flexible environment\

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/custom-runtimes/create-app](https://docs.cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/custom-runtimes/create-app)
- Source ID: `site-docs-reference`
- Final score: 65
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- You can generally select the region nearest to your app's users, but you should consider the locations where App Engine is available as well as the locations of the other Google Cloud products and services that your app uses.
- Before you begin Before running the sample app in this quickstart, you need to set up your environment and create a new Google Cloud project for App Engine: Create a new Google Cloud project by using the Google Cloud console: Open the Google Cloud console: Go to Projects Click Create Project and then name your new Google Cloud project.
- Navigate to the nginx directory where the sample code is located, for example: cd appengine-custom-runtimes-samples/nginx Running Hello World on your local machine You can test the sample app by downloading and installing Docker , and then running the Hello World container on your local machine.
- App Engine Locations App Engine is regional , which means the infrastructure that runs your apps is located in a specific region, and Google manages it so that it is available redundantly across all of the zones within that region .
