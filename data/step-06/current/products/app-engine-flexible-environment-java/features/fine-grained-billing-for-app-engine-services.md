- To read your Google Cloud project-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --project= PROJECT ID To read your folder-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : folders/ FOLDER ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --folder= FOLDER ID To read your organization-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --organization= ORGANIZATION ID To read your Cloud Billing account-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : billingAccounts/ BILLING ACCOUNT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --billing-account= BILLING ACCOUNT ID Add the --freshness flag to your command to read logs that are more than 1 day old.
- Console In the Google Cloud console, you can use the Logs Explorer to retrieve your audit log entries for your Google Cloud project, folder, or organization: Note: You can't view audit logs for Cloud Billing accounts in the Google Cloud console.
