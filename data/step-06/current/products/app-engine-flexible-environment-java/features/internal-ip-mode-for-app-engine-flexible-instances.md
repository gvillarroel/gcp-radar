- To enable and disable debug mode in gcloud : Use the gcloud app instances enable-debug command to debug the VMs for a particular instance and version, as follows: gcloud app --project PROJECT-ID instances enable-debug Replace PROJECT-ID with your own project ID, and follow the prompts to specify the instance version to debug.
- To connect to an instance in the console: Visit the Google Cloud console instances page for your project: Go to the instances page Click SSH in the far right of the row containing the instance you want to access: This puts the instance into debug mode, and opens an SSH session for the instance in a terminal window.
- When finished debugging, disable debug mode as follows: gcloud app --project PROJECT-ID instances disable-debug Follow the prompts to specify the instance version When you disable debug mode, the VM is stopped and a new instance of your app is started, running on a clean, new VM.
