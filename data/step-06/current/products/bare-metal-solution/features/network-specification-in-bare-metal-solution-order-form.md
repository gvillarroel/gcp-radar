- Consider using a single VPC network with global dynamic routing enabled if your Bare Metal Solution environment will require access to other Google Cloud regions to connect to any of the following resources: Other Bare Metal Solution environments VMs in other regions Other Google Cloud services Your on-premises sites in other geographical locations Using a VPC network with global dynamic routing and custom advertisement mode , you can set up a routed environment to connect your Bare Metal Solution instances directly to your Google Cloud and extended on-premises environments in other regions, without any additional configuration in Google Cloud.

- Use a uniform LUN size Create no more than two ASM disk groups Stripe ASM disk groups across all LUNs in all volumes Use LUNs and volumes with the same performance characteristics in the same disk group Do not share storage volumes across multiple RAC clusters Know the required IOPS and throughput capacity before you create ASM disk groups Leave the multipath configuration as-is Configure important settings for ASM Create your ASM disk group with external redundancy Reboot your Bare Metal Solution servers after ASM disk creation Use a uniform LUN size The LUN size you select should be representative of the unit of growth.
- Set the ORACLEASM SCANORDER variable If you're using Oracle ASMLib, then to stop Oracle ASM from selecting your single path ASM device first, set the scan order as follows: ORACLEASM SCANORDER="dm" ORACLEASM SCANEXCLUDE="sd" We require this setting because the Bare Metal Solution storage environment uses DM devices that you can view in /proc/partitions file.
- These instructions use 10g as a value, but the behavior is the same for 19c Grid Infrastructure as well. (Follow MOS Note : 1679409.1) Create your ASM disk group with external redundancy The storage provided by Bare Metal Solution uses NETAPP RAID-DP , which is a form of RAID 6 that protects data even if two disks fail.
