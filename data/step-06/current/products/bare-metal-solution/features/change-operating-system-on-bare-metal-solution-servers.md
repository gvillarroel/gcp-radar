Evidence snippets:
- Operating system When setting up your operating system on a Bare Metal Solution server, we recommend you perform the following actions.
- Bare Metal Solution servers come with a 20GB root file system which might not be sufficient.
- To configure jumbo frames on Bare Metal Solution servers for Oracle RAC: View the settings of your Bare Metal Solution private network to confirm that jumbo frames have been configured: gcloud bms networks describe NETWORK NAME -- project = PROJECT ID -- region = REGION grep jumboFramesEnabled Sample output: jumboFramesEnabled : true Identify the network interfaces and their mtu size: ip link show grep mtu Sample output: 1 : lo : < LOOPBACK , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 2 : enp55s0f1 : < NO - CARRIER , BROADCAST , MULTICAST , UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 3 : enp55s0f2 : < NO - CARRIER , BROADCAST , MULTICAST , UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 4 : enp55s0f3 : < NO - CARRIER , BROADCAST , MULTICAST , UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 5 : enp17s0f0 : < BROADCAST , MULTICAST , SLAVE , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq master bond0 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 6 : enp17s0f1 : < BROADCAST , MULTICAST , SLAVE , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq master bond1 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 7 : enp173s0f0 : < BROADCAST , MULTICAST , SLAVE , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq master bond0 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 8 : enp173s0f1 : < BROADCAST , MULTICAST , SLAVE , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq master bond1 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 9 : bond1 : < BROADCAST , MULTICAST , MASTER , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 10 : bond1 .
- Use a uniform LUN size Create no more than two ASM disk groups Stripe ASM disk groups across all LUNs in all volumes Use LUNs and volumes with the same performance characteristics in the same disk group Do not share storage volumes across multiple RAC clusters Know the required IOPS and throughput capacity before you create ASM disk groups Leave the multipath configuration as-is Configure important settings for ASM Create your ASM disk group with external redundancy Reboot your Bare Metal Solution servers after ASM disk creation Use a uniform LUN size The LUN size you select should be representative of the unit of growth.

Evidence snippets:
- Understand the factors that impact performance for the network and your backup servers The following items affect network I/O between Oracle on Bare Metal Solution and your backup servers in Google Cloud: Flash storage Similar to Google Cloud Persistent Disk, the flash storage arrays that provide the storage for Bare Metal Solution systems increase I/O capabilities based on how much storage you assign to the host.
- If you use an NFS or dNFS-based backup disk, then egress from the Linux host (Agent) in Bare Metal Solution to the backup/recovery appliance in the Compute Engine VPC on the following ports: TCP/UDP-111 (rpcbind) TCP/UDP-756 (status) TCP/UDP-2049 (nfs) TCP/UDP-4001 (mountd) TCP/UDP-4045 (nlockmgr) Configure Google Cloud DNS to resolve Bare Metal Solution hostnames and domains, to ensure name resolution is consistent across Bare Metal Solution servers, VMs, and Compute Engine-based resources such as the Backup and DR Service.
- Number of processors used The Bare Metal Solution servers come in several sizes .
- Figure 1 : Components for using Backup and DR with Oracle databases in a Bare Metal Solution environment As you can see in the diagram, this solution requires the following components: Bare Metal Solution regional extension– Allows you to run Oracle databases in a third-party data center adjacent to a Google Cloud data center, and use your existing on-premises software licenses.

Evidence snippets:
- For the OS image code, see Operating systems . curl -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT ID " \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ "https://baremetalsolution.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /instances/ SERVER NAME ?updateMask=os image" -d "{ 'osImage' : ' OS IMAGE ' }" Because this change takes awhile to complete, you can check the status by following the steps in View the status of a long-running operation .
- Retrieve the initial password for a server When you first receive your Bare Metal Solution server or change the operating system , the server begins in a default state and has an initial password.
- ProjectsClient () bms client = BareMetalSolutionClient () output = [] errors = [] try : for project in get projects ( parent , folders client , projects client ): volumes list request = ListVolumesRequest ( parent = "projects/" + project + "/locations/global" , filter = filter , ) try : for volume in bms client . list volumes ( request = volumes list request ): output . append ( f " - { volume . name } " ) This could happen because BMS API is not enabled in a certain project. except PermissionDenied as e : errors . append ( f "Unable to list bms resources for project { project } : { e } " ) except PermissionDenied as e : errors . append ( f "Unable to access folder or project: { e } " ) return " \n " . join ( output ), " \n " . join ( errors ) def main ( : Sequence [ str ]): if ORGANIZATION ID . value is not None and FOLDER ID . value is not None : raise Exception ( "Only one of organization ID or folder ID must be provided" ) elif ORGANIZATION ID . value is None and FOLDER ID . value is None : raise Exception ( "Either one of organization ID or folder ID must be provided" ) elif ORGANIZATION ID . value is not None : parent = f "organizations/ { ORGANIZATION ID . value } " else : parent = f "folders/ { FOLDER ID . value } " volumes , errors = get volumes list ( parent , filter = FILTER . value ) print ( "=================== Flat list of volumes in the folder or organization" " ===================" ) print ( volumes ) print ( "=================== List of folders or projects with errors" " ===================" ) print ( errors ) if name == " main " : app . run ( main ) Manage servers You can manage the servers in your Bare Metal Solution environment in the following ways: View servers Organize servers by using labels Rename a server Retrieve the initial password for a server View OS details Change the OS for a server Enable hyperthreading on a server View servers To view the details of your Bare Metal Solution servers, follow these steps: Console Go to the Servers page.
- To list the servers in your Bare Metal Solution environment and see their status, enter your project ID and region into the following curl command, copy the command, paste it into the Cloud Shell prompt, and press the Enter or Return key: curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ "https://baremetalsolution.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /instances" To get network and storage information for a server in your Bare Metal Solution environment, issue the following command: curl -X GET \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ "https://baremetalsolution.googleapis.com/v2/projects/ PROJECT ID /locations/ REGION /instances/ SERVER NAME " Organize servers by using labels To help organize your servers, you can use labels.
