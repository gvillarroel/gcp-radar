Evidence snippets:
- Understand the factors that impact performance for the network and your backup servers The following items affect network I/O between Oracle on Bare Metal Solution and your backup servers in Google Cloud: Flash storage Similar to Google Cloud Persistent Disk, the flash storage arrays that provide the storage for Bare Metal Solution systems increase I/O capabilities based on how much storage you assign to the host.
- Figure 1 : Components for using Backup and DR with Oracle databases in a Bare Metal Solution environment As you can see in the diagram, this solution requires the following components: Bare Metal Solution regional extension– Allows you to run Oracle databases in a third-party data center adjacent to a Google Cloud data center, and use your existing on-premises software licenses.
- When you enable Direct NFS for an Oracle database, configure sufficient source CPU (for example, 8x vCPUs and 8 RMAN channels), and establish a 10GB link between your Bare Metal Solution regional extension and Google Cloud, you can back up a single Oracle database with increased throughput between 700-900+ MB/s.
- Solution Guide: Google Cloud Backup and DR for Oracle on Bare Metal Solution Overview To provide resiliency for your Oracle databases inside a Bare Metal Solution environment, you need to have a clear strategy for database backups and disaster recovery.
