Evidence snippets:
- Understand the factors that impact performance for the network and your backup servers The following items affect network I/O between Oracle on Bare Metal Solution and your backup servers in Google Cloud: Flash storage Similar to Google Cloud Persistent Disk, the flash storage arrays that provide the storage for Bare Metal Solution systems increase I/O capabilities based on how much storage you assign to the host.
- Figure 1 : Components for using Backup and DR with Oracle databases in a Bare Metal Solution environment As you can see in the diagram, this solution requires the following components: Bare Metal Solution regional extension– Allows you to run Oracle databases in a third-party data center adjacent to a Google Cloud data center, and use your existing on-premises software licenses.
- When you enable Direct NFS for an Oracle database, configure sufficient source CPU (for example, 8x vCPUs and 8 RMAN channels), and establish a 10GB link between your Bare Metal Solution regional extension and Google Cloud, you can back up a single Oracle database with increased throughput between 700-900+ MB/s.
- Solution Guide: Google Cloud Backup and DR for Oracle on Bare Metal Solution Overview To provide resiliency for your Oracle databases inside a Bare Metal Solution environment, you need to have a clear strategy for database backups and disaster recovery.

- Use a uniform LUN size Create no more than two ASM disk groups Stripe ASM disk groups across all LUNs in all volumes Use LUNs and volumes with the same performance characteristics in the same disk group Do not share storage volumes across multiple RAC clusters Know the required IOPS and throughput capacity before you create ASM disk groups Leave the multipath configuration as-is Configure important settings for ASM Create your ASM disk group with external redundancy Reboot your Bare Metal Solution servers after ASM disk creation Use a uniform LUN size The LUN size you select should be representative of the unit of growth.

- These instructions use 10g as a value, but the behavior is the same for 19c Grid Infrastructure as well. (Follow MOS Note : 1679409.1) Create your ASM disk group with external redundancy The storage provided by Bare Metal Solution uses NETAPP RAID-DP , which is a form of RAID 6 that protects data even if two disks fail.
