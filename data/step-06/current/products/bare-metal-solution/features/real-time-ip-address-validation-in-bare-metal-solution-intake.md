Evidence snippets:
- During the PoC, we learned how to configure multiple elements together successfully – Oracle, Google Cloud Backup and DR, storage, and regional extension links – in a Bare Metal Solution environment.
- If the Oracle service name is not listed, create a service name entry on the server(s) in the tnsnames.ora file located at $ORACLE HOME/network/admin or at $GRID HOME/network/admin by adding the following entry: CLU1 S = (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = )(PORT = 1521)) (CONNECT DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED) (SERVICE NAME = CLU1 S) ) ) If the tnsnames.ora file is in a non-standard location, provide the absolute path to the file in the Application Details and Settings page described in Configure application details and settings for Oracle databases .
- If you use an NFS or dNFS-based backup disk, then egress from the Linux host (Agent) in Bare Metal Solution to the backup/recovery appliance in the Compute Engine VPC on the following ports: TCP/UDP-111 (rpcbind) TCP/UDP-756 (status) TCP/UDP-2049 (nfs) TCP/UDP-4001 (mountd) TCP/UDP-4045 (nlockmgr) Configure Google Cloud DNS to resolve Bare Metal Solution hostnames and domains, to ensure name resolution is consistent across Bare Metal Solution servers, VMs, and Compute Engine-based resources such as the Backup and DR Service.
- Understand the factors that impact performance for the network and your backup servers The following items affect network I/O between Oracle on Bare Metal Solution and your backup servers in Google Cloud: Flash storage Similar to Google Cloud Persistent Disk, the flash storage arrays that provide the storage for Bare Metal Solution systems increase I/O capabilities based on how much storage you assign to the host.

- Use a name server as a substitute for Cloud DNS If you don't want to use the Cloud DNS, then install your own name server to resolve host IP addresses on the Bare Metal Solution server.
- To configure jumbo frames on Bare Metal Solution servers for Oracle RAC: View the settings of your Bare Metal Solution private network to confirm that jumbo frames have been configured: gcloud bms networks describe NETWORK NAME -- project = PROJECT ID -- region = REGION grep jumboFramesEnabled Sample output: jumboFramesEnabled : true Identify the network interfaces and their mtu size: ip link show grep mtu Sample output: 1 : lo : < LOOPBACK , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 2 : enp55s0f1 : < NO - CARRIER , BROADCAST , MULTICAST , UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 3 : enp55s0f2 : < NO - CARRIER , BROADCAST , MULTICAST , UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 4 : enp55s0f3 : < NO - CARRIER , BROADCAST , MULTICAST , UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 5 : enp17s0f0 : < BROADCAST , MULTICAST , SLAVE , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq master bond0 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 6 : enp17s0f1 : < BROADCAST , MULTICAST , SLAVE , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq master bond1 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 7 : enp173s0f0 : < BROADCAST , MULTICAST , SLAVE , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq master bond0 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 8 : enp173s0f1 : < BROADCAST , MULTICAST , SLAVE , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 1500 qdisc mq master bond1 state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 9 : bond1 : < BROADCAST , MULTICAST , MASTER , UP , LOWER UP > mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 10 : bond1 .
- Use a uniform LUN size Create no more than two ASM disk groups Stripe ASM disk groups across all LUNs in all volumes Use LUNs and volumes with the same performance characteristics in the same disk group Do not share storage volumes across multiple RAC clusters Know the required IOPS and throughput capacity before you create ASM disk groups Leave the multipath configuration as-is Configure important settings for ASM Create your ASM disk group with external redundancy Reboot your Bare Metal Solution servers after ASM disk creation Use a uniform LUN size The LUN size you select should be representative of the unit of growth.
