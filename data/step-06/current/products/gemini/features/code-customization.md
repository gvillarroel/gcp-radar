"Try /fix on chat-generated code." Cleaning, simplifying, and refactoring code Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Can you merge IMPORTS VARIABLES OR NOTE EXPORTED FUNCTIONS in this file?" "How would you simplify the FUNCTION NAME function?" "Can you merge FUNCTION NAME 1 and FUNCTION NAME 2 into one function?" "Could you inline some variables in FUNCTION NAME ?" "Could you simplify variable naming in the function FUNCTION NAME ?" Readability Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Write the function FUNCTION NAME in fewer lines of code, if possible." "Add comments to the function FUNCTION NAME ." "Remove unnecessary whitespaces in the function FUNCTION NAME ." "Format the function FUNCTION NAME in a similar way as the rest of the code." Code review Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Split the code in parts and explain each part using our codebase." "Are there variables or keywords that could be shorter and more self-explanatory?" "Can you give me useful code from the REPOSITORY NAME PACKAGE MODULE context for this code?" "What do you think about the function FUNCTION NAME ?" Debugging Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "I am getting an error when I try to do X/add Y.
- Use cases and prompt examples The following table provides guidance and examples about using code customization in specific use cases: Use case Things worth trying Writing new code Try the following to generate code in your IDE or Gemini Code Assist chat: Generate code that would use terms which are already mentioned in your codebase.
- If you highlight or select code when you send a message in chat, Gemini Code Assist uses that code to improve code customization and chat quality.
- Why?" "Can you spot an error in the function FUNCTION NAME ?" "How would you fix the function FUNCTION NAME given this error message?" Learning and onboarding Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Split this code in parts and explain each of them using our codebase." "Show how to call function FUNCTION NAME ?" "Show how to run the main function in the ENVIRONMENT NAME environment?" "What is the key technical improvement we can do to make this code more performant?" "Show me the implementation of FUNCTION OR CLASS NAME to achieve better results and add what that specific element is"—for example, "Show me the implementation of function foo where foo is the name of the function." Migration Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Give me a strategy for how I can migrate FILE NAME from LANGUAGE 1 to LANGUAGE 2 "—for example, from Go to Python. "Given the function FUNCTION NAME in repository REPOSITORY NAME , find me an equivalent function in language LANGUAGE NAME that I can use." Try the following chat-based or code generation transformation workflow using prompts: "Take FILENAME COMPONENT code already written in LANGUAGE 1 and refactor and migrate it to LANGUAGE 2 "—for example, from Go to Python.
