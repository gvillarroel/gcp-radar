Evidence snippets:
- Exclude files from local context If files are specified in a .aiexclude or .gitignore file, Gemini Code Assist by default excludes them from local use in the context for code completion, code generation, code transformation, and chat.
- Once Gemini Code Assist finishes generating suggested code, you can click Accept , which applies the suggested code to your file, or you can click Decline , which leaves your original code unchanged.
- Gemini Code Assist then prioritizes the selected repositories when generating a response.
- A successful check results in the following output: $ grpc-health-probe -addr cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com:443 -tls error: this server does not implement the grpc health protocol (grpc.health.v1.Health): GRPC target method can't be resolved An unsuccessful check results in the following output: timeout: failed to connect service "cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com:443" within 1s To obtain more details, run the following before grpc-health-probe : export GRPC GO LOG SEVERITY LEVEL=info IntelliJ There are no known issues for Gemini Code Assist for IntelliJ and other supported JetBrains IDEs.

Evidence snippets:
- Try the following prompts: "Is there something which can be improved?" "Give me possible pain points." "How would you test this code if that migration is correct?" Generating documentation Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Summarize the code in package or folder X and provide documentation for the top five important methods." "Generate documentation for FUNCTION OR CLASS NAME ." "Shorten the documentation while preserving the key information." Unit test generation Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Generate unit tests for FILENAME ." "Add the most relevant test cases for the FUNCTION NAME function." "Remove test cases that you think don't bring much value." Best practices Use relevant variable and function names or code snippets.
- Why?" "Can you spot an error in the function FUNCTION NAME ?" "How would you fix the function FUNCTION NAME given this error message?" Learning and onboarding Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Split this code in parts and explain each of them using our codebase." "Show how to call function FUNCTION NAME ?" "Show how to run the main function in the ENVIRONMENT NAME environment?" "What is the key technical improvement we can do to make this code more performant?" "Show me the implementation of FUNCTION OR CLASS NAME to achieve better results and add what that specific element is"—for example, "Show me the implementation of function foo where foo is the name of the function." Migration Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Give me a strategy for how I can migrate FILE NAME from LANGUAGE 1 to LANGUAGE 2 "—for example, from Go to Python. "Given the function FUNCTION NAME in repository REPOSITORY NAME , find me an equivalent function in language LANGUAGE NAME that I can use." Try the following chat-based or code generation transformation workflow using prompts: "Take FILENAME COMPONENT code already written in LANGUAGE 1 and refactor and migrate it to LANGUAGE 2 "—for example, from Go to Python.
- Can you give me an overview of this repository's purpose and key modules?" For code generation and modification: " @ REPOSITORY NAME Implement an authentication function similar to the one in this repository." " @ REPOSITORY NAME Refactor the following code to follow the conventions in the selected repository." " @ REPOSITORY A NAME How can I use the latest functions from this repository to improve my code in REPOSITORY B NAME ?" For testing: " @ UNIT TEST FILE NAME Generate unit tests for MODULE based on the examples in the selected file." By using remote repositories as a focused source of context, you can get more accurate and relevant suggestions from Gemini Code Assist, which can help you code faster and more efficiently.
- Try generating code with the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Write a main function where a connection to DATABASE is created.
