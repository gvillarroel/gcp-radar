- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Go to Browser In the Filter search bar, select the Metric property, then search for the metric for which you are requesting an increase: Use storage.googleapis.com/google egress bandwidth to increase Google egress for your buckets located in regions.
- Bandwidth monitoring metrics The following bandwidth usage data is available for monitoring: Google egress bandwidth per second per region: monitors Google egress bandwidth usage for buckets in your project that are located in regions.
- If the previous instructions don't work for you, or if you need bandwidth greater than 5 Tbps for egress from buckets in zones, regions, or dual-regions, contact your Technical Account Manager or Google representative.
- For the storage.googleapis.com/dualregion google egress bandwidth and storage.googleapis.com/dualregion internet egress bandwidth metrics, there must be non-zero historical usage of the metric before you can request an increase.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- As a result, dual-region and multi-region buckets are designed to have a recovery time objective (RTO) of zero, and temporary regional failures are normally invisible to users; in the case of a regional outage, dual-region and multi-region buckets automatically continue serving all data that has been replicated across regions.
- Turbo replication Turbo replication provides faster redundancy across regions for data in your dual-region buckets, which reduces the risk of data loss exposure and helps support uninterrupted service following a regional outage.
- If one of the regions in which an object is stored becomes unavailable after the object is successfully uploaded but prior to it being replicated for georedundancy, Cloud Storage's strong consistency ensures that stale versions of the object won't be served and that subsequent overwrites aren't reverted when the region becomes available again.
- While redundancy across regions and turbo replication help support business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) efforts, administrators should plan and implement a full BCDR architecture that's appropriate for their workload.

- Note: When creating a configurable dual-region , you must set the <LocationConstraint> element to be the location code associated with the underlying regions, and you must also include a <CustomPlacementConfig> element.
- Note: When creating a configurable dual-region , you must set the --location flag to be the location code associated with the underlying regions, and you must use the --placement flag with a valid pair of regions.
- Note: When creating a configurable dual-region , you must set the location parameter to be the location code associated with the underlying regions, and you must also include a customPlacementConfig parameter.
