Evidence snippets:
- Monitoring alerts You can use Monitoring alerting policies to inform you when metrics such as storage.googleapis.com/google egress bandwidth , storage.googleapis.com/dualregion google egress bandwidth , and storage.googleapis.com/multiregion google egress bandwidth approach a quota limit.
- For the storage.googleapis.com/dualregion google egress bandwidth and storage.googleapis.com/dualregion internet egress bandwidth metrics, there must be non-zero historical usage of the metric before you can request an increase.
- Use storage.googleapis.com/dualregion internet egress bandwidth to increase Internet egress for your buckets located in dual-regions.
- Use storage.googleapis.com/dualregion google egress bandwidth to increase Google egress for your buckets located in dual-regions.

Evidence snippets:
- Redundancy across regions While traditional storage models often rely on an active-passive approach with "primary" and "secondary" geographic locations, Cloud Storage dual-regions and multi-regions provide an active-active architecture based on a single bucket with redundancy across regions.
- To achieve redundancy between a region pairing not available as a dual-region, consider creating a separate bucket for each region and using Storage Transfer Service event-driven transfers or cross-bucket replication to keep the buckets in sync.
- Cloud Storage also offers a cross-bucket replication capability that can be used to replicate data between independent buckets to meet additional data replication needs that aren't met by dual-region or multi-region locations.
- The following sections cover how Cloud Storage redundantly stores data, the default replication behavior for dual-regions and multi-regions, and advanced features like turbo replication and cross-bucket replication.
