Evidence snippets:
- Copy the image from its saved location to the folder where your bucket is mounted, using the cp command: cp kitten.png "$HOME/mount-folder/kitten.png" Verify that the image was copied to your local file system and uploaded to the bucket successfully by following the steps: To check that kitten.png was copied to your local file system, run ls on the folder where your bucket is mounted: ls "$HOME/mount-folder" If the copy operation was successful, kitten.png is returned in the output.
- Clean up To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used on this page, delete the resources by completing the following steps: Unmount the storage bucket from your Linux machine by using the fusermount tool: fusermount -u "$HOME/mount-folder" To delete the bucket and everything inside of it, use the gcloud storage rm command with the --recursive flag: gcloud storage rm gs:// BUCKET NAME --recursive Replace BUCKET NAME with the name of your bucket.
- In this quickstart, you'll complete the following tasks: Install Cloud Storage FUSE on Debian or Ubuntu Mount the bucket as a folder on the machine Upload an object to the bucket You'll use the Google Cloud CLI to create and manage the object in your storage bucket, and you'll use the Cloud Storage FUSE CLI to mount your bucket to your machine.
- Mount the bucket To mount the bucket to your local file system, complete the following steps: Generate Application Default Credentials using the gcloud auth application-default login command: gcloud auth application-default login Cloud Storage FUSE automatically loads the credentials.
