Evidence snippets:
- Subset of the index You can create multiple repository groups and assign IAM roles to different IAM principals. data "google iam policy" "foo" { binding { role = "roles/cloudaicompanion.repositoryGroupsUser" members = [ "test-user@example.com" ] } } resource "google gemini repository group iam policy" "foo" { project = " PROJECT ID " location = " REGION " code repository index id = " INDEX NAME " repository group id = " GROUP NAME " policy data = data.google iam policy.foo.policy data } data "google gemini repository group iam policy" "foo" { project = " PROJECT ID " location = " REGION " code repository index id = " INDEX NAME " repository group id = " GROUP NAME " depends on = [ google gemini repository group iam policy.foo ] } You can also create a binding: resource "google gemini repository group iam binding" "foo" { project = " PROJECT ID " location = " REGION " code repository index id = " INDEX NAME " repository group id = " GROUP NAME " role = "roles/cloudaicompanion.repositoryGroupsUser" members = [ "test-user@example.com" ] } Replace the following: GROUP NAME : the repository group name you created in a preceding step to control access to your index using repository groups.
- You also can create a repository group with repositories defined in a JSON (or YAML) file, formatted as follows: JSON [ { "resource" : " REPOSITORY RESOURCE NAME " , "branchPattern" : "main dev" }, { "resource" : " REPOSITORY RESOURCE NAME " , "branchPattern" : "dev" } ] YAML - resource : REPOSITORY RESOURCE NAME branchPattern : main dev - resource : REPOSITORY RESOURCE NAME branchPattern : dev To create a repository group based on a JSON or YAML file, in a shell environment, use the gemini code-repository-indexes repository-groups create command : JSON gcloud gemini code-repository-indexes repository-groups create REPOSITORY GROUP \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --location = REGION \ --code-repository-index = INDEX NAME \ --repositories = FILEPATH .json YAML gcloud gemini code-repository-indexes repository-groups create REPOSITORY GROUP \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --location = REGION \ --code-repository-index = INDEX NAME \ --repositories = FILEPATH .yaml If preferred, you can encrypt and control your data with a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) through Cloud Key Management Service .
