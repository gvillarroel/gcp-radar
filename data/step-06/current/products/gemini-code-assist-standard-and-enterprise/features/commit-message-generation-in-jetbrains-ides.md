Evidence snippets:
- Why?" "Can you spot an error in the function FUNCTION NAME ?" "How would you fix the function FUNCTION NAME given this error message?" Learning and onboarding Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Split this code in parts and explain each of them using our codebase." "Show how to call function FUNCTION NAME ?" "Show how to run the main function in the ENVIRONMENT NAME environment?" "What is the key technical improvement we can do to make this code more performant?" "Show me the implementation of FUNCTION OR CLASS NAME to achieve better results and add what that specific element is"—for example, "Show me the implementation of function foo where foo is the name of the function." Migration Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Give me a strategy for how I can migrate FILE NAME from LANGUAGE 1 to LANGUAGE 2 "—for example, from Go to Python. "Given the function FUNCTION NAME in repository REPOSITORY NAME , find me an equivalent function in language LANGUAGE NAME that I can use." Try the following chat-based or code generation transformation workflow using prompts: "Take FILENAME COMPONENT code already written in LANGUAGE 1 and refactor and migrate it to LANGUAGE 2 "—for example, from Go to Python.
- Try the following prompts: "Is there something which can be improved?" "Give me possible pain points." "How would you test this code if that migration is correct?" Generating documentation Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Summarize the code in package or folder X and provide documentation for the top five important methods." "Generate documentation for FUNCTION OR CLASS NAME ." "Shorten the documentation while preserving the key information." Unit test generation Try the following prompts in Gemini Code Assist chat: "Generate unit tests for FILENAME ." "Add the most relevant test cases for the FUNCTION NAME function." "Remove test cases that you think don't bring much value." Best practices Use relevant variable and function names or code snippets.
- Can you give me an overview of this repository's purpose and key modules?" For code generation and modification: " @ REPOSITORY NAME Implement an authentication function similar to the one in this repository." " @ REPOSITORY NAME Refactor the following code to follow the conventions in the selected repository." " @ REPOSITORY A NAME How can I use the latest functions from this repository to improve my code in REPOSITORY B NAME ?" For testing: " @ UNIT TEST FILE NAME Generate unit tests for MODULE based on the examples in the selected file." By using remote repositories as a focused source of context, you can get more accurate and relevant suggestions from Gemini Code Assist, which can help you code faster and more efficiently.
- Use cases and prompt examples The following table provides guidance and examples about using code customization in specific use cases: Use case Things worth trying Writing new code Try the following to generate code in your IDE or Gemini Code Assist chat: Generate code that would use terms which are already mentioned in your codebase.
