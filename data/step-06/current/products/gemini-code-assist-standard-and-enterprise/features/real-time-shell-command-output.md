Evidence snippets:
- List the number of unique users The following instructions describe how to use the gcloud CLI to list the number of unique users of Gemini Code Assist in the most recent 28-day period: In a shell environment, ensure that you have updated all installed components of the gcloud CLI to the latest version: gcloud components update Read the log entries for Gemini Code Assist users and usage: gcloud logging read 'resource.type=cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/Instance labels.product= "code assist"' \ --freshness 28d \ --project PROJECT ID \ --format "csv(timestamp.date('%Y-%m-%d'),labels.user id)" Replace PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID.
- The output is similar to the following: 2024-10-30,user1@company.com 2024-10-29,user2@company.com 2024-10-29,user2@company.com 2024-10-29,user2@company.com 2024-10-29,user1@company.com 2024-10-28,user1@company.com Create a chart that displays daily usage The following steps show how to use Monitoring to create daily use graphs that show the aggregate total of daily active Gemini Code Assist users and the number of their requests per day.
- In the query pane, enter the following query, and then click Run query : resource.type="cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/Instance" AND labels.product="code assist" AND jsonPayload.@type="type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.cloudaicompanion.logging.v1.ResponseLog" Note: The default time period value is Last 1 hour , but you can set it to a longer time period (such as Last 7 days ).
- Create a Monitoring metric from your log data that records the number of Gemini Code Assist users: In the Google Cloud console, go to the segment Logs Explorer page: Go to Logs Explorer If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is Logging .
