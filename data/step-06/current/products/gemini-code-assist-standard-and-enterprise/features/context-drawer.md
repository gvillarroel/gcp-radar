Evidence snippets:
- IntelliJ The following methods of getting context are usually available to Gemini Code Assist in agent mode: Information in your IDE project including your files, indexed symbols and usage of symbols in your project.
- IntelliJ read file Retrieves the text content of a file using its absolute path. write file Writes the given text to a specified file, creating the file if it doesn't exist. analyze current file Analyzes the open file in the editor for errors and warnings. find files Finds the absolute path to files given a filename or a part of the path grep Finds all files inside the project that contain a given text pattern or regular expression. list files Lists all files and directories in a given absolute path. resolve symbol Resolves a specific symbol reference to its original declaration. find usages Searches the project for all references to a given symbol declaration. git Runs a Git command-line interface (CLI) command and returns the result. list vcs roots Returns all Version Control System (VCS) roots, such as Git repositories, in the current project.
- Tools Tools are a broad category of services that an agent can use for context and actions in its response to your prompt.
- Context can be taken from files in your IDE, files in your local system folders, tool responses, and your prompt details.
