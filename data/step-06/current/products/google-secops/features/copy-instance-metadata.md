Evidence snippets:
- Click Share to make the column set available to all other users in your Google SecOps tenant.
- The following examples show supported boolean operators ( AND , OR , and NOT ): A AND B A OR B Use parentheses ( ) to group expressions and control evaluation order: (A OR B) AND (B OR C) AND (C OR NOT D) Examples: Search for login events on the finance server: metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN" and target.hostname = "finance-svr" Use the operator (>) to search for connections where more than 10 MB of data was sent: metadata.event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" and network.sent bytes > 10000000 Use multiple conditions to search for winword.exe launching cmd.exe or powershell.exe : metadata.event type = "PROCESS LAUNCH" and principal.process.file.full path = /winword/ and ( target.process.file.full path = /cmd.exe/ or target.process.file.full path = /powershell.exe/ ) Search key-value pairs in additional and labels fields: The additional and labels fields act as customizable containers for event data that doesn't map to standard UDM fields.
- For example: additional.fields["key"]="value" Examples of searches using specific key-value pairs in the additional and labels fields: Search for events containing specified key-value pairs: additional.fields["pod name"] = "kube-scheduler" metadata.ingestion labels["MetadataKeyDeletion"] = "startup-script" Use the AND operator with key-value pair searches: additional.fields["pod name"] = "kube-scheduler" AND additional.fields["pod name1"] = "kube-scheduler1" Search for all events that contain the specified key, regardless of the value: additional.fields["pod name"] != "" Search for events that contain a specific key, using a regular expression: additional.fields.value.string value = "mystring" Note: You can also use value.bool value or value.number value for boolean and numeric matches.
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.

- For example, a webhook defined on: https:// xxxx.siemplify-soar.com/api/external/v1 /webhooks/{webhook id}?api key=xxxx will need to be updated to: https:// us-chronicle.googleapis.com/v1alpha/projects/{project id}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance/{instance id} /webhooks/{webhook id}?api key=xxxx The authentication for webhooks remains unchanged.

Evidence snippets:
- To filter and identify these specific events, you can create a custom label with the name Suspicious DHCP Activity with the following query: metadata.event type = "NETWORK DHCP" AND principal.ip = "10.0.0.1" The custom label works in the following manner: Google SecOps continuously ingests network logs and events into its UDM.
- ENDS WITH scopename matches any name that ends with "scopename" and is evaluated as true for the example scope and also for projects/1234/locations/us/instances/2342-434-44-3434-343434/dataAccessScopes/testscopename .
- Configure data RBAC for users Supported in: Google secops SIEM This page describes how data role-based access control ( data RBAC ) administrators can configure data RBAC within Google Security Operations.
- If the metadata.event type field is NETWORK DHCP and if the principal.ip field (the IP address of the device requesting the DHCP lease) is 10.0.0.1 , Google SecOps applies the custom label to the event.
