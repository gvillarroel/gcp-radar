Evidence snippets:
- Joins without a match section : You can now use join operations to correlate and combine data from multiple sources based on common field values without requiring a match section (unlike statistical joins).
- You can now use joins in statistical Search queries that include a match section to correlate data from multiple sources.
- Announcement New parser documentation now available New parser documentation is available to help you ingest and normalize logs from the following sources: Collect Absolute Secure Endpoint logs Collect AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) logs Collect Akamai Enterprise Application Access logs Collect Apache Hadoop logs Collect Armis Vulnerabilities logs Collect Array Networks SSL VPN logs Collect Aruba IPS logs Collect Atlassian Confluence logs Collect Cisco AMP for Endpoints logs Collect Cisco APIC logs Collect Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) logs Collect Cisco CallManager logs Collect Cisco CloudLock CASB logs Collect Cisco DNA Center Platform logs Collect Cisco eStreamer logs Collect Cribl Stream logs Collect CrowdStrike FileVantage logs Collect CrowdStrike IDP Services logs Collect Cynet 360 AutoXDR logs Collect Digital Shadows SearchLight logs Collect Duo Telephony logs Collect Edgio WAF logs Collect Elastic Auditbeat logs Collect Elastic Packet Beats logs Collect Elasticsearch logs Collect Entrust nShield HSM audit logs Collect Imperva Advanced Bot Protection logs Collect Imperva Attack Analytics logs Collect Imperva Audit Trail logs Collect Imperva CEF logs Collect Imperva Data Risk Analytics (DRA) logs Collect Imperva Database logs Collect Imperva FlexProtect logs Collect Imperva SecureSphere Management logs Collect Kiteworks (formally Accellion) logs Collect Proofpoint Emerging Threats Pro IOC logs Collect ServiceNow audit logs Collect Team Cymru Scout Threat Intelligence data Collect URLScan IO logs Collect Uptycs EDR logs Collect VanDyke VShell SFTP logs Collect Zendesk CRM logs Collect ZeroFox Platform logs November 10, 2025 Feature Nested if You can now use if statements in both the outcome and events sections and also within the then else clauses of another if statement.
- You can now do the following: Use enhanced filtering to include Bottom 30 values in addition to Top 30 values for each UDM Field in search results Use 'field[key] = value' exact match to search the 'additional' and 'labels' fields Pin fields (using the push pin icon) in Quick Filter to save them as a favorite.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example: additional.fields["key"]="value" Examples of searches using specific key-value pairs in the additional and labels fields: Search for events containing specified key-value pairs: additional.fields["pod name"] = "kube-scheduler" metadata.ingestion labels["MetadataKeyDeletion"] = "startup-script" Use the AND operator with key-value pair searches: additional.fields["pod name"] = "kube-scheduler" AND additional.fields["pod name1"] = "kube-scheduler1" Search for all events that contain the specified key, regardless of the value: additional.fields["pod name"] != "" Search for events that contain a specific key, using a regular expression: additional.fields.value.string value = "mystring" Note: You can also use value.bool value or value.number value for boolean and numeric matches.
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- You can search for individual UDM events and groups of UDM events that match the same query.
- When searching Values , UDM Lookup displays Possible value match when a match is found in the following cases: Matches in the following UDM fields: metadata.description security result.description security result.detection fields.value security result.summary network.http.user agent Matches in fields with a full path that ends in one of the following values: .command line For example principal.process.command line . .file.full path For example principal.process.file.full path . .labels.value For example src.labels.value . .registry.registry key For example principal.registry.registry key . .url For example principal.url .
