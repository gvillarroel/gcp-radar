- Create a composite detection that uses the output of that curated rule as its first condition.
- When to use composite detections Composite detections can be useful for achieving the following goals: Correlate outcomes of two or more rules (for example, linking a Malware Downloaded detection with a subsequent C2 Beaconing alert from the same host).
- Then, use a composite rule with a long match window (for example, 24 hours) to trigger on an initial suspicious login and correlate it with any of the following detections from the same user: A user clearing their command-line history.
