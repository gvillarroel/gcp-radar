Evidence snippets:
- See the following example. metadata . vendor name = "Microsoft" metadata . product name = "Windows Defender AV" metadata . product event type = "MALWAREPROTECTION STATE MALWARE DETECTED" principal . asset . hostname = "client02.example.local" security result . action = "BLOCK" security result . severity = "MEDIUM" Create a new YARA-L detection engine rule. rule windows defender av monitored events { meta : author = "Chronicle" description = "Migration of CBN alerts to Google SecOps YARA-L detection engine rule alert." // Severity is set at the Outcome level via security result.severity severity = "INFORMATIONAL" priority = "INFORMATIONAL" events : $ windows defender av . metadata . vendor name = "Microsoft" $ windows defender av . metadata . product name = "Windows Defender AV" $ windows defender av . metadata . product event type = "MALWAREPROTECTION STATE MALWARE DETECTED" $ windows defender av . principal . asset . hostname = $ host // optionally tune to only detection on ALLOW, i.e., failure to BLOCK //$windows defender av.security result.action = "ALLOW" // optionally tune on severity of detection //$windows defender av.security result.severity != "LOW" outcome : $ risk score = max ( if ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity = "UNKNOWN SEVERITY" , 0 ) + if ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity = "LOW" , 25 ) + if ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity = "MEDIUM" , 50 ) + if ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity = "HIGH" , 75 ) + if ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity = "CRITICAL" , 100 ) ) $ severity = array distinct ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity ) condition : $ windows defender av } CBN alert appears to use a field that was not parsed into UDM Using the parser extensions option you can quickly address this scenario.
- Use UDM search Using the UDM search option, you can view events with the alert state set in the parsers: security result.alert state = "ALERTING" From the UDM search results, you can explore the following fields to understand which sources are generating CBN alerts in your environment: Metadata > Vendor Name Metadata > Product Name Download default CBN alerts using the Tools API and manually review The previous approach helps you to find alerts that have fired, but does not cover the scenario of alerts that you have not seen before.
- We recommend that you migrate the existing CBN alerts to the YARA-L detection engine as described in this guide.
- For example, Corelight CBN alert uses the notice field and conditionally alerts only if true: if [ notice ] == "true" { mutate { replace = > { "is significant" = > "true" "is alert" = > "true" } } } Because this value isn't normalized into UDM by default you can use a parser extension Grok as follows to add that value as a UDM field of type Additional : filter { mutate { replace = > { "notice" = > "" } } grok { match = > { "message" = > [ "(?P<message>\{. \})$" ] } on error = > " grok not syslog" overwrite = > [ "message" ] } json { on error = > "not json" source = > "message" array function = > "split columns" } if ! [ not json ] { if [ notice ] != "" { mutate { convert = > { "notice" = > "string" } } mutate { replace = > { "additional notice.key" = > "notice" "additional notice.value.string value" = > "%{notice}" } } mutate { merge = > { "event1.idm.read only udm.additional.fields" = > "additional notice" } } mutate { merge = > { "@output" = > "event1" } } } } } You can then utilize this in a YARA-L detection engine rule as follows, and using the Maps function : events : // Corelight : Weird Log ( $ corelight . metadata . vendor name = "Corelight" and $ corelight . metadata . product name = "Zeek" and // this requires a custom parser extension to extract notice $ corelight . metadata . product event type = "weird" and $ corelight . additional . fields [ "notice" ] = "true" ) You must enable and turn on the authored rules for alerting.
