# Rule observability for detections and alerts

Product: Google SecOps
Coverage: LOW

## Step 02 Summary

Detection and alert objects now include metadata showing whether they came from a primary rule run or a rule replay.

## Extended Definition

Detection and alert objects now include metadata showing whether they came from a primary rule run or a rule replay.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed.

### "Migrate CBN alerts to YARA-L detection rule alerts \_|\_ Google Security\

Evidence snippets:
- For example, Corelight CBN alert uses the notice field and conditionally alerts only if true: if [ notice ] == "true" { mutate { replace = > { "is significant" = > "true" "is alert" = > "true" } } } Because this value isn't normalized into UDM by default you can use a parser extension Grok as follows to add that value as a UDM field of type Additional : filter { mutate { replace = > { "notice" = > "" } } grok { match = > { "message" = > [ "(?P<message>\{. \})$" ] } on error = > " grok not syslog" overwrite = > [ "message" ] } json { on error = > "not json" source = > "message" array function = > "split columns" } if ! [ not json ] { if [ notice ] != "" { mutate { convert = > { "notice" = > "string" } } mutate { replace = > { "additional notice.key" = > "notice" "additional notice.value.string value" = > "%{notice}" } } mutate { merge = > { "event1.idm.read only udm.additional.fields" = > "additional notice" } } mutate { merge = > { "@output" = > "event1" } } } } } You can then utilize this in a YARA-L detection engine rule as follows, and using the Maps function : events : // Corelight : Weird Log ( $ corelight . metadata . vendor name = "Corelight" and $ corelight . metadata . product name = "Zeek" and // this requires a custom parser extension to extract notice $ corelight . metadata . product event type = "weird" and $ corelight . additional . fields [ "notice" ] = "true" ) You must enable and turn on the authored rules for alerting.
- See the following example. metadata . vendor name = "Microsoft" metadata . product name = "Windows Defender AV" metadata . product event type = "MALWAREPROTECTION STATE MALWARE DETECTED" principal . asset . hostname = "client02.example.local" security result . action = "BLOCK" security result . severity = "MEDIUM" Create a new YARA-L detection engine rule. rule windows defender av monitored events { meta : author = "Chronicle" description = "Migration of CBN alerts to Google SecOps YARA-L detection engine rule alert." // Severity is set at the Outcome level via security result.severity severity = "INFORMATIONAL" priority = "INFORMATIONAL" events : $ windows defender av . metadata . vendor name = "Microsoft" $ windows defender av . metadata . product name = "Windows Defender AV" $ windows defender av . metadata . product event type = "MALWAREPROTECTION STATE MALWARE DETECTED" $ windows defender av . principal . asset . hostname = $ host // optionally tune to only detection on ALLOW, i.e., failure to BLOCK //$windows defender av.security result.action = "ALLOW" // optionally tune on severity of detection //$windows defender av.security result.severity != "LOW" outcome : $ risk score = max ( if ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity = "UNKNOWN SEVERITY" , 0 ) + if ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity = "LOW" , 25 ) + if ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity = "MEDIUM" , 50 ) + if ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity = "HIGH" , 75 ) + if ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity = "CRITICAL" , 100 ) ) $ severity = array distinct ( $ windows defender av . security result . severity ) condition : $ windows defender av } CBN alert appears to use a field that was not parsed into UDM Using the parser extensions option you can quickly address this scenario.
- Google Security Operations's YARA-L detection engine is the preferred option for detection alerts because it offers enhanced transparency in detection logic and robust tuning capabilities.
- Migrate CBN alerts to YARA-L detection rule alerts Caution: The Enterprise Insights page and CBN alerts are deprecated.

### "Composite detections \_|\_ Google Security Operations \_|\_ Google Cloud\

- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- By setting a rule to detect only and then plotting its detections in a dashboard widget, you can track trends, identify outliers, and gain a high-level audit view of the activity without being overwhelmed by individual alerts.
- The following concepts define the building blocks of composite rules and clarify how they function within detection workflows: Composite rules : use detections or alerts (or both) as input.
- Based on this evaluation, you can use composite rules to create new detections to be used as an intermediary representation for investigation, and alerting with a subsequent rule.
- When to use composite detections Composite detections can be useful for achieving the following goals: Correlate outcomes of two or more rules (for example, linking a Malware Downloaded detection with a subsequent C2 Beaconing alert from the same host).

Evidence snippets:
- The customer has the option to enable or disable these rules within their Google SecOps account and to enable or disable alerts for these rules.
- Configure rule exclusions To manage the volume of alerts from GCTI curated detections, you can configure rule exclusions.
- View details about a rule set You can modify the settings for any curated detection by clicking the menu icon more vert for the rule set, and then selecting View and edit rule settings .
- Curated detections features The following are some of the key curated detections features: Curated Detection: curated detection created and managed by GCTI for Google SecOps customers.
