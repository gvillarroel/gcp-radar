Evidence snippets:
- Proactive Threat Hunting: Utilize GTI feeds and insights within Google SecOps search and detection rules (YARA-L) to proactively hunt for emerging threats and specific attacker TTPs within your environment.
- SIEM Log Searching and Investigation : During a CDIR investigation, or on an ad-hoc basis, analysts can use either natural language syntax, Yara-L syntax, or raw log searching to surface information in various logs ingested into Google SecOps related to cloud infrastructure and services.
- Google SecOps provides Cloud Detection Investigation and Response (CDIR), Case Management, SIEM log searching and investigation, Cloud Asset Inventory collection for Entity Graph Enrichment, and the ability to automate common SOC workflows using the SOAR component of Google SecOps.
- Centralized Investigation: The IOC Matches page serves as the central hub for viewing matched IOCs, filtering results (by Type, Priority, Status, Source: Mandiant, etc.), and drilling down into event details, UDM context, threat intelligence rationale, and associations.

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- When searching Values , UDM Lookup displays Possible value match when a match is found in the following cases: Matches in the following UDM fields: metadata.description security result.description security result.detection fields.value security result.summary network.http.user agent Matches in fields with a full path that ends in one of the following values: .command line For example principal.process.command line . .file.full path For example principal.process.file.full path . .labels.value For example src.labels.value . .registry.registry key For example principal.registry.registry key . .url For example principal.url .
- When searching Values , UDM Lookup does not return matches in the following cases: Matches in the following UDM fields: metadata.product log id network.session id security result.rule id network.parent session id Matches in UDM fields with a full path that ends in one of the following values: .pid For example target.process.pid . .asset id For example principal.asset id . .product specific process id For example principal.process.product specific process id . .resource.id For example principal.resource.id .
- For example: principal.ip = /10. / Search for the execution of psexec.exe (Window): target.process.command line = /\bpsexec(\.exe)?\b/ nocase For details about regular expressions, see the regular expressions page .
