Evidence snippets:
- Multi-stage queries in YARA-L let you feed the output of one query stage directly into the input of a subsequent stage.
- February 24, 2026 Feature New: cross joins in multi-stage queries You can now use cross joins in YARA-L 2.0 multi-stage queries let you compare individual UDM event data against aggregated statistics calculated in previous YARA-L stages.
- This feature lets you feed the output of one query stage into the input of another, providing more granular data transformation than a single, monolithic query.
- Composite detections lets users link multiple YARA-L rules to detect complex, multistage threats.

Evidence snippets:
- Condition section The condition section ensures that e1 , context graph , and matched conditions exist and or match the specified condition. condition: // Ensure $e1, $context graph and $matched conditions conditions are met. $e1 AND $context graph AND $matched conditions = 1 Complete YARA-L rule At this point the rule is ready for use and should look like the following: rule fusion feed example principal process file md5 { meta: rule name = "File Hash - Applied Threat Intelligence" description = "Matches file hashes against the Applied Threat Intelligence Fusion Feed." events: // Filter graph $context graph.graph.metadata.product name = "MANDIANT FUSION IOC" $context graph.graph.metadata.vendor name = "MANDIANT FUSION IOC" $context graph.graph.metadata.entity type = "FILE" $context graph.graph.metadata.source type = "GLOBAL CONTEXT" // Do join $ioc = $context graph.graph.entity.file.md5 $ioc = $e1.principal.process.file.md5 match: $ioc over 1h outcome: // Extract the Mandiant Automated Intel confidence score of maliciousness $confidence score = max(if($context graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict info.source provider = "Mandiant Automated Intel", $context graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict info.confidence score, 0)) // Extract the status of the indicator as seen in a breached environment $breached = max(if($context graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict info.pwn = true, 1, 0)) // Intermediary outcome variable to combine conditions of intelligence extracted in the previous outcome variables. // Return 1 if conditions are met, otherwise return 0. $matched conditions = if($confidence score >= 80 AND $breached = 1, 1, 0) condition: // Ensure $e1, $context graph and $matched conditions conditions are met. $e1 AND $context graph AND $matched conditions = 1 } ATI Fusion Feed context entity fields You can use many fields from the ATI Fusion Feed in rules.

- The following example shows a Fusion Feed context entity as an initial reference point: { "metadata": { "product entity id": "md5--147d19e6-cdae-57bb-b9a1-a8676265fa4c", "collected timestamp": { "seconds": "1695165683", "nanos": 48000000 }, "vendor name": "MANDIANT FUSION IOC", "product name": "MANDIANT FUSION IOC", "product version": "1710194393", "entity type": "FILE", "creation timestamp": { "seconds": "1710201600" }, "interval": { "start time": { "seconds": "1" }, "end time": { "seconds": "253402300799" } }, "threat": [ { "category details": [ "A phishing email message or the relevant headers from a phishing email." ], "severity details": "HIGH", "confidence details": "75", "risk score": 75, "first discovered time": { "seconds": "1683294326" }, "associations": [ { "id": "threat-actor--3e5e6bdf-5b4e-5166-84fa-83045e637f23", "type": "THREAT ACTOR", "name": "UNC2633" }, { "id": "threat-actor--3e5e6bdf-5b4e-5166-84fa-83045e637f23", "country code": [ "unknown" ], "type": "THREAT ACTOR", "name": "UNC2633", "description": "UNC2633 is a distribution threat cluster that delivers emails containing malicious attachments or links that lead to malware payloads, primarily QAKBOT, but also SNOWCONE.GZIPLOADER (which leads to ICEDID) and MATANBUCHUS.
- This can all be done in the outcome section of the rule. outcome: // Extract the Mandiant Automated Intel confidence score of maliciousness $confidence score = max(if($context graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict info.source provider = "Mandiant Automated Intel", $context graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict info.confidence score, 0)) // Extract the status of the indicator as seen in a breached environment $breached = max(if($context graph.graph.metadata.threat.verdict info.pwn = true, 1, 0)) // Intermediary outcome variable to combine conditions of intelligence extracted in the previous outcome variables. // Return 1 if conditions are met, otherwise return 0. $matched conditions = if($confidence score >= 80 AND $breached = 1, 1, 0) In the outcome section of the YARA-L rule, the confidence score is extracted using an if statement wrapped in a max function.
