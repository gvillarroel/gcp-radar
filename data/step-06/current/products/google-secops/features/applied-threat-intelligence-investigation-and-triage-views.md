Evidence snippets:
- Applied Threat Intelligence priority overview Supported in: Google secops SIEM Applied Threat Intelligence (ATI) alerts in Google Security Operations are IoC matches that have been contextualized by YARA-L rules using curated detection.
- ATI priorities are provided in the Applied Threat Intelligence - Curated Prioritization rule pack, which is available in Google SecOps Managed Content with the Google SecOps Enterprise Plus license.
- Priority models are used in the curated detection rules provided in the Applied Threat Intelligence - Curated prioritization rule pack.
- Medium priority The Medium model prioritizes indicators identified by Google Threat Intelligence with a Malicious GTI Verdict and High GTI Severity, even if they weren't observed in Mandiant investigations.

- Contextual enrichment and evidence gathering The agent executes several parallel analysis steps to build a comprehensive picture of the suspicious activity by leveraging internal and external intelligence: Google Threat Intelligence (GTI) enrichment : Identifies and evaluates indicators of compromise (IoCs), such as file hashes, IP addresses, and domains against Google Threat Intelligence and VirusTotal to identify known malicious entities.
- Use Triage and Investigation Agent to investigate alerts Supported in: Google secops The Triage and Investigation Agent (TIN) is an AI-powered investigation assistant embedded in Google Security Operations.
- Investigation timeline TIN investigation follows a structured, multi-stage timeline designed to transform raw alerts into actionable intelligence.

Evidence snippets:
- Curated detection rule sets The Curated Prioritization category includes the following rule sets that support the Applied Threat Intelligence feature in Google SecOps: Active Breach Priority Network Indicators : Detects network-related Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) in event data using Mandiant Threat Intelligence and prioritizes IoCs with the 'Active breach' label.
- Applied Threat Intelligence curated detections overview Supported in: Google secops SIEM This document provides an overview of the Curated Detection rule sets within the Applied Threat Intelligence Curated Prioritization category, available in Google Security Operations Enterprise Plus.
- If the network.direction field is not populated in the UDM event, then Applied Threat Intelligence checks the principal.ip and target.ip fields against RFC 1918 internal IP address ranges to determine the network direction.
- Google SecOps evaluates your UDM event data against IoCs curated by Mandiant Threat Intelligence and identifies matches for domains, IP addresses, file hashes, and URLs.
