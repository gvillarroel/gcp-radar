- View aggregated results For statistics-based searches, Google SecOps supports large aggregated result sets.
- Types of grouped UDM fields You can search across all of the following grouped UDM fields: Grouped field name Associated UDM fields domain about.administrative domain about.asset.network domain network.dns.questions.name network.dns domain principal.administrative domain principal.asset.network domain target.administrative domain target.asset.hostname target.asset.network domain target.hostname email intermediary.user.email addresses network.email.from network.email.to principal.user.email addresses security result.about.user.email addresses target.user.email addresses file path principal.file.full path principal.process.file.full path principal.process.parent process.file.full path target.file.full path target.process.file.full path target.process.parent process.file.full path hash about.file.md5 about.file.sha1 about.file.sha256 principal.process.file.md5 principal.process.file.sha1 principal.process.file.sha256 security result.about.file.sha256 target.file.md5 target.file.sha1 target.file.sha256 target.process.file.md5 target.process.file.sha1 target.process.file.sha256 hostname intermediary.hostname observer.hostname principal.asset.hostname principal.hostname src.asset.hostname src.hostname target.asset.hostname target.hostname ip intermediary.ip observer.ip principal.artifact.ip principal.asset.ip principal.ip src.artifact.ip src.asset.ip src.ip target.artifact.ip target.asset.ip target.ip namespace principal.namespace src.namespace target.namespace process id principal.process.parent process.pid principal.process.parent process.product specific process id principal.process.pid principal.process.product specific process id target.process.parent process.pid target.process.parent process.product specific process id target.process.pid target.process.product specific process id user about.user.userid observer.user.userid principal.user.user display name principal.user.userid principal.user.windows sid src.user.userid target.user.user display name target.user.userid target.user.windows sid Find a UDM field for search query While writing a search query, you may not know which UDM field to include.
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- Format the data value to search for Format the data value using the following guidelines: Data type: Format the data value based it's the data type: Enumerated values: Use a valid enumerated value defined for the selected UDM field.
