Evidence snippets:
- The following examples show supported boolean operators ( AND , OR , and NOT ): A AND B A OR B Use parentheses ( ) to group expressions and control evaluation order: (A OR B) AND (B OR C) AND (C OR NOT D) Examples: Search for login events on the finance server: metadata.event type = "USER LOGIN" and target.hostname = "finance-svr" Use the operator (>) to search for connections where more than 10 MB of data was sent: metadata.event type = "NETWORK CONNECTION" and network.sent bytes > 10000000 Use multiple conditions to search for winword.exe launching cmd.exe or powershell.exe : metadata.event type = "PROCESS LAUNCH" and principal.process.file.full path = /winword/ and ( target.process.file.full path = /cmd.exe/ or target.process.file.full path = /powershell.exe/ ) Search key-value pairs in additional and labels fields: The additional and labels fields act as customizable containers for event data that doesn't map to standard UDM fields.
- Types of grouped UDM fields You can search across all of the following grouped UDM fields: Grouped field name Associated UDM fields domain about.administrative domain about.asset.network domain network.dns.questions.name network.dns domain principal.administrative domain principal.asset.network domain target.administrative domain target.asset.hostname target.asset.network domain target.hostname email intermediary.user.email addresses network.email.from network.email.to principal.user.email addresses security result.about.user.email addresses target.user.email addresses file path principal.file.full path principal.process.file.full path principal.process.parent process.file.full path target.file.full path target.process.file.full path target.process.parent process.file.full path hash about.file.md5 about.file.sha1 about.file.sha256 principal.process.file.md5 principal.process.file.sha1 principal.process.file.sha256 security result.about.file.sha256 target.file.md5 target.file.sha1 target.file.sha256 target.process.file.md5 target.process.file.sha1 target.process.file.sha256 hostname intermediary.hostname observer.hostname principal.asset.hostname principal.hostname src.asset.hostname src.hostname target.asset.hostname target.hostname ip intermediary.ip observer.ip principal.artifact.ip principal.asset.ip principal.ip src.artifact.ip src.asset.ip src.ip target.artifact.ip target.asset.ip target.ip namespace principal.namespace src.namespace target.namespace process id principal.process.parent process.pid principal.process.parent process.product specific process id principal.process.pid principal.process.product specific process id target.process.parent process.pid target.process.parent process.product specific process id target.process.pid target.process.product specific process id user about.user.userid observer.user.userid principal.user.user display name principal.user.userid principal.user.windows sid src.user.userid target.user.user display name target.user.userid target.user.windows sid Find a UDM field for search query While writing a search query, you may not know which UDM field to include.
- Supported fields You can download the following fields to a CSV file from the platform: user hostname process name event type timestamp raw log (valid only when raw logs are enabled for the customer) All fields starting with udm.additional Valid field types You can download the following field types to a CSV file: double float int32 uint32 int64 uint64 bool string enum bytes google.protobuf.Timestamp google.protobuf.Duration Unsupported fields Fields that start with "udm" (not udm.additional) and meet either of the following conditions cannot be downloaded to CSV: The nesting of the field is more than 10 deep in udm proto.
- When searching Values , UDM Lookup displays Possible value match when a match is found in the following cases: Matches in the following UDM fields: metadata.description security result.description security result.detection fields.value security result.summary network.http.user agent Matches in fields with a full path that ends in one of the following values: .command line For example principal.process.command line . .file.full path For example principal.process.file.full path . .labels.value For example src.labels.value . .registry.registry key For example principal.registry.registry key . .url For example principal.url .
