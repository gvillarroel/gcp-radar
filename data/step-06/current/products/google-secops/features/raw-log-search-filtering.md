Evidence snippets:
- Click an entity to display the Entity context dialog, which can include the following items: Asset name First time seen Last time seen IP addresses MAC addresses Number of alerts Highest alert count by rule Alerts-over-time bar graph Open Alerts & IOCs link View in Alerts Tab link Use the Pivot Table to analyze events The Pivot Table lets you analyze events using expressions and functions against the results from the search.
- Download search results with raw log correlation You can download a maximum of 1 million normalized UDM events as a CSV file for offline analysis.
- For example, if you have a database called suspicious with a column of IP addresses you know are problematic, you can reference that database in Search instead of manually entering individual IP addresses in Search: events: $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow your results by searching for specific metadata in addition to IP addresses, for example you might be specifically concerned with changes to user resources: events: $e.metadata.event type = "USER RESOURCE UPDATE CONTENT" $e.principal.ip in %susupicious.ip You can narrow a search against interrelated UDM fields and match against multiple data table columns.
- Supported fields You can download the following fields to a CSV file from the platform: user hostname process name event type timestamp raw log (valid only when raw logs are enabled for the customer) All fields starting with udm.additional Valid field types You can download the following field types to a CSV file: double float int32 uint32 int64 uint64 bool string enum bytes google.protobuf.Timestamp google.protobuf.Duration Unsupported fields Fields that start with "udm" (not udm.additional) and meet either of the following conditions cannot be downloaded to CSV: The nesting of the field is more than 10 deep in udm proto.
