- Page Summary outlined flag Earth Engine supports assets backed by Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs), which improve performance in collections by indexing spatial and metadata fields at creation time.
- To create a COG-backed asset, you need to place COG files in a specific GCS bucket location, write an image upload manifest, and use the earthengine command-line utility.

Evidence snippets:
- You can see a complete list of table upload options by visiting the Table Manifest guide or with: earthengine upload table -h external image To create an asset backed by an external image, run the upload image command with a manifest: earthengine upload external image --manifest /tmp/foo.json An example manifest is: { "name" : "projects/{project}/assets/cogdemo1" , "tilesets" : [ { "id" : "0" , "sources" : [{ "uris" : [ "gs://ee-docs-demos/COG demo.tif" ] }] } ], "properties" : { "source" : "https://code.earthengine.google.com/d541cf8b268b2f9d8f834c255698201d" }, "startTime" : "2016-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z" , "endTime" : "2016-12-31T15:01:23.000000000Z" } See the Cloud GeoTIFF guide and the Image Manifest guide for more details on constructing the manifest.
- The options are also described in the Image Manifest guide. table To upload a Shapefile, CSV, or TFRecord from Google Cloud Storage to an Earth Engine table asset, you can use any of: earthengine upload table --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/myUploadedShapefile gs://bucket/foo.shp earthengine upload table --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/myUploadedCSV gs://bucket/foo.csv earthengine upload table --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/myUploadedTFRecord gs://bucket/foo.tfrecord Note: when uploading Shapefiles, you only need to specify the path to the .shp file.

Evidence snippets:
- Before saving and uploading, ensure your model accepts data in a payload format that Earth Engine supports.
- Model Endpoint Management Once a model is uploaded to Vertex AI, create an endpoint and deploy the model through the Online Prediction page by creating a new endpoint or by using the gcloud command line with the commands endpoints create and endpoints deploy-model .
- Performing inference with a custom trained model using a machine learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch requires saving and uploading the model to Vertex AI, creating a prediction endpoint and deploying the model to serve traffic at the created endpoint.
- Model deployment involves uploading your saved model artifact to Google Cloud Storage and then using Vertex AI's Model Registry or gcloud commands to upload and deploy the model to an endpoint.
