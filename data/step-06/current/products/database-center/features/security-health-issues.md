Evidence snippets:
- You can use Database Center to learn more about your database fleet health by prompting Gemini to answer questions about the following: Database fleet inventory information Database fleet health Database configuration best practices The following are example prompts to help you learn about your database fleet inventory data: "How many PostgreSQL instances do I have in Tokyo?" "How many of my database resources are not NIST 800-53 compliant?" "Why is it an issue that my database is exposed to ownership chaining?" "Why is it an issue that my database is not logging only DDL statements?" Note: Gemini provides query suggestions and health issues based on all instances and databases in your project.
- Examples of prompts include the following: "Are all of my database backups working correctly?" "How many databases do I have with data protection issues?" "Which of my database resources are located in the US?" "Show me the number of database resources I have by product type and engine." "Show me key:value labeled databases with performance recommendations." (replace "key:value" with your own label) "Show me all Cloud SQL databases running on PostgreSQL version 12." Use Gemini to help you analyze database fleet health As an early-stage technology, Gemini for Google Cloud products can generate output that seems plausible but is factually incorrect.
- To determine the number of database resources, for example, you can enter the following prompt: How many of my Postgres 13 databases are affected by security issues?
