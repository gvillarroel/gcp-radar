(2025-04-15) Bug Fixes dataflow: Update google.golang.org/api to 0.229.0 ( 3319672 ) March 17, 2025 Libraries Go 0.10.5 (2025-03-13) Bug Fixes dataflow: Update golang.org/x/net to 0.37.0 ( 1144978 ) March 13, 2025 Feature Dataflow now supports data lineage.
- July 27, 2020 Feature Dataflow now supports Dataflow Shuffle, Streaming Engine, FlexRS, and the following regional endpoints in GA: northamerica-northeast1 (Montréal) asia-southeast1 (Singapore) australia-southeast1 (Sydney) June 08, 2020 Feature Dataflow is now able to use workers in zones in the asia-southeast2 region (Jakarta).
- April 21, 2023 Feature Dataflow ML now supports the Automatic Model Refresh feature, which lets you update your machine learning model without stopping your Apache Beam pipeline.

### Use Dataflow Prime \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/enable-dataflow-prime](https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/enable-dataflow-prime)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 132
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Unsupported features Dataflow Prime doesn't support the following: Designating specific VM types by using the flag --worker machine type or --machine type for Python pipelines and --workerMachineType for Java pipelines.
- SDK version support Dataflow Prime supports the following Apache Beam SDKs: Apache Beam Python SDK version 2.21.0 or later Apache Beam Java SDK version 2.30.0 or later Apache Beam Go SDK version 2.44.0 or later To download the SDK package or to read the Release Notes, see Apache Beam Downloads .
- Attempting to set a minimum CPU platform with Dataflow Prime might result in an error such as: Setting minimum CPU platform is not supported for the selected machine type e2-standard-2.
- Vertical Autoscaling This feature automatically adjusts the memory available to the Dataflow worker VMs to fit the needs of the pipeline and help prevent out-of-memory errors.

### Build custom container images for Dataflow \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/build-container-image](https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/build-container-image)
- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 126
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- When the job first starts and during autoscaling, the dependency installation often leads to high CPU usage and a long warm-up period on all newly started Dataflow workers.
- Use a larger Cloud Build worker machine type by passing --cloud build machine type= machine type , where machine type is one of the following options: n1-highcpu-8 n1-highcpu-32 e2-highcpu-8 e2-highcpu-32 By default, Cloud Build uses the machine type e2-medium .
- Your container image must support the architecture of the worker VMs for your Dataflow job.
- If you don't set this entrypoint, the Dataflow workers don't start properly.
