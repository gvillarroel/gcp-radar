Evidence snippets:
- The following example shows how to add parameters to your regular pipeline parameters in order to use FlexRS: --flexRSGoal = COST OPTIMIZED \ --region = europe-west1 \ --maxNumWorkers = 10 \ --workerMachineType = n1-highmem-16 If you omit region , maxNumWorkers , and workerMachineType , the Dataflow service determines the default value.

- Pricing FlexRS jobs are billed for the following resources: Regular and preemptible CPUs Memory resources Dataflow Shuffle resources 25 GB per worker of Persistent Disk resources While Dataflow uses both preemptible and regular workers to execute your FlexRS job, you are billed a uniform discounted rate compared to regular Dataflow prices regardless of the worker type.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-required-3`
- Final score: 81
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Regional placement offers benefits such as: Improved resource availability: Dataflow jobs are more resilient to zonal resource availability errors, because workers can continue to be created in other zones with remaining availability.
- Improved reliability: In the event of a zonal failure, Dataflow jobs can continue to run, because workers are recreated in other zones.
- Override the worker region or zone By default, when you submit a job with the --region option, workers are automatically assigned to either zones across the region or the single best zone within the region, depending on the job type.
- Although user data is strictly handled by Dataflow workers in their assigned geographic region, pipeline log messages are stored in Cloud Logging , which has a single global presence in Google Cloud.
