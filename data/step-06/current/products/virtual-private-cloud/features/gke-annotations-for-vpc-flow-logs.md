- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- VPC Flow Logs can't add Pod annotations because, for packets to the internet, the masquerade agent translates the Pod IP address to the node IP address before VPC Flow Logs sees the packet.
- If you select custom metadata, you can specify the metadata fields that you want to include by the parent field, such as src vpc , or by their full names, such as src vpc.project id When new metadata fields are added to the record format, they're excluded from the flow logs unless they're within a parent field that you have specified to include.
- For information about how to customize metadata fields, see Enable VPC Flow Logs or Update VPC Flow Logs configuration .
- To configure log filtering for an existing VPC Flow Logs configuration, see Update VPC Flow Logs configuration .

- You can: Monitor the VPC network Perform network diagnosis Filter the flow logs by VMs, serverless endpoints, VLAN attachments, and Cloud VPN tunnels to understand traffic changes Understand traffic growth for capacity forecasting Understanding network usage and optimizing network traffic expenses You can analyze network usage with VPC Flow Logs to optimize network traffic expenses.

- In the query editor field, enter a query: For example, to view flow logs for a specific source Cloud VPN tunnel, enter the following query: resource.type="vpc flow logs config" logName="projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/networkmanagement.googleapis.com%2Fvpc flows" jsonPayload.reporter="SRC GATEWAY" labels.target resource name="projects/ PROJECT NUMBER /regions/ REGION /vpnTunnels/ NAME " Replace the following: PROJECT ID : the Google Cloud project ID of the Cloud VPN tunnel PROJECT NUMBER : the project number of the Cloud VPN tunnel REGION : the region of the Cloud VPN tunnel NAME : the name of the Cloud VPN tunnel If you enabled VPC Flow Logs for a subnet by using the Compute Engine API, the query must target compute.googleapis.com .
- For example, enter the following query, replacing PROJECT ID with your Google Cloud project ID and SUBNET NAME with your subnet: resource.type="gce subnetwork" logName="projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fvpc flows" resource.labels.subnetwork name=" SUBNET NAME " For more examples of queries that you can run to view your flow logs, see Examples of Logs Explorer queries for VPC Flow Logs .
- VPC Flow Logs uses the following logs to collect log entries: The networkmanagement.googleapis.com/vpc flows log collects log entries for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks, subnets, VLAN attachments for Cloud Interconnect, and Cloud VPN tunnels.

Evidence snippets:
- Cross-project annotations disabled The following example describes how VPC Flow Logs annotates log records for VM-to-VM flows between projects when cross-project annotations are disabled.
- Cross-project annotations enabled The following example describes how VPC Flow Logs annotates log records for VM-to-VM flows between projects when cross-project annotations are enabled.
- The following table shows a flow as reported by either 10.10.0.10 or 10.10.0.20 . src vpc.project id and dest vpc.project id are for the host project because the VPC subnet belongs to the host project. src instance.project id and dest instance.project id are for the service projects because the instances belong to the service projects. connection .src ip src instance .project id src vpc .project id connection .dest ip dest instance .project id dest vpc .project id 10.10.0.10 web server host project 10.10.0.20 recommendation host project Service projects don't own the Shared VPC network and don't have access to the flow logs of the Shared VPC network.
- Hybrid connectivity flows For hybrid connectivity through VLAN attachments for Cloud Interconnect and Cloud VPN tunnels, VPC Flow Logs annotates the following flows: Flows between VM instances, including instances used as GKE nodes, and on-premises endpoints Flows between Google services and on-premises endpoints Transit flows between on-premises endpoints The following example describes how VPC Flow Logs annotates flows between a VM instance in a VPC network and an on-premises endpoint.
