- Start with all routes of the VPC network that contains the hybrid subnet route and then remove the following routes: All policy-based routes All subnet routes All static routes that have network tags All routes whose destinations are broader than and contain the hybrid subnet route that was matched in the first route model Perform the most specific destination through select only the most favorable preference category steps in the routing order.
- An option to skip evaluating other policy-based routes An internal passthrough Network Load Balancer Policy-based routes can apply to all VMs in the network, to certain VMs selected by network tag, or to traffic entering the VPC network through VLAN attachments for Cloud Interconnect (in only one region, or in all regions).
- Policy-based routes : Policy-based routes are evaluated after special routing paths but before other types of routes.
