- You can balance your traffic visibility and storage cost needs by adjusting the following aspects of logs collection: Aggregation interval .
- If you need to analyze all packets, you can use Packet Mirroring and collector instances running third-party software.
- VPC Flow Logs samples the following packets: Packets that are sent from and received by virtual machine (VM) instances , including instances used as Google Kubernetes Engine nodes Packets that are sent from and received by Cloud Run resources configured with Direct VPC egress Packets that are sent through VLAN attachments for Cloud Interconnect and Cloud VPN tunnels You can view flow logs in Cloud Logging , and you can export logs to any destination that Cloud Logging export supports.

- Privately used public IP address ranges Privately used public IPv4 addresses Privately used public IPv4 addresses: Are IPv4 addresses that are normally routable on the internet, but that are used privately in a VPC network Cannot belong to a prohibited subnet range When you use these addresses as subnet ranges, Google Cloud does not announce these routes to the internet and does not route traffic from the internet to them.
- If the ipv6AccessType property is EXTERNAL and the ipCollection property isn't empty, the subnet was created with an IPv6 BYOIP address range.
