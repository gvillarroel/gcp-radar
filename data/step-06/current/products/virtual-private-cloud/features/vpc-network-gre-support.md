Evidence snippets:
- Google Cloud console screenshot for a trace that's blocked by a hierarchical firewall policy rule (click to enlarge) Test failures for Shared VPC networks In Shared VPC networks, not having permissions to the host project or the service project can cause the test failures listed in the following table.
- Blue rectangle Hop A step in the forwarding path for a trace packet, representing a Google Cloud resource that forwards a packet to the next hop in a VPC network—for example, to a Cloud Load Balancing proxy or to a Cloud VPN tunnel.
- Test failures for VPC Network Peering networks With VPC Network Peering, not having permission to the peered network's Google Cloud project from the primary network can cause the test result listed in the following table.
- Ingress firewall rule card expanded (click to enlarge) When a trace contains a VPC network route with the next hop as a peered VPC network, the start of the trace is not a VM instance, but a VPC network.

Evidence snippets:
- Before setting the MTU to a value higher than 1460 , review Maximum transmission unit . module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-custom-mode-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "subnet-01" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/24" subnet region = "us-west1" }, { subnet name = "subnet-02" subnet ip = "10.10.20.0/24" subnet region = "us-west1" subnet private access = "true" subnet flow logs = "true" }, { subnet name = "subnet-03" subnet ip = "10.10.30.0/24" subnet region = "us-west1" subnet flow logs = "true" subnet flow logs interval = "INTERVAL 10 MIN" subnet flow logs sampling = 0.7 subnet flow logs metadata = "INCLUDE ALL METADATA" subnet flow logs filter = "false" } ] } Next, create firewall rules .
- The per network limits describe the maximum number of secondary ranges that you can define for each subnet. --enable-flow-logs : Enables VPC Flow Logs in the subnet at creation time. --enable-private-ip-google-access : Enables Private Google Access in the subnet at creation time. --purpose : Enables you to specify the purpose of the subnet . --role : Enables you to specify a role (active or backup) for a proxy-only subnet .
- Before setting the MTU to a value higher than 1460 , review Maximum transmission unit . resource "google compute network" "vpc network" { project = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes name = "my-auto-mode-network" auto create subnetworks = true mtu = 1460 } To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see Basic Terraform commands .
- You can omit both flags if you want to configure only external IPv6 on subnets in this VPC network. gcloud compute networks create NETWORK \ --subnet-mode=custom \ [ --enable-ula-internal-ipv6 [ --internal-ipv6-range= ULA IPV6 RANGE ]] \ --bgp-routing-mode= DYNAMIC ROUTING MODE \ --mtu= MTU Replace the following: NETWORK : a name for the VPC network.

- Base entity Icon Description Aggregation hierarchy (top to bottom) VM instance A Compute Engine VM instance region > network > subnet > zone > instance group > instance VM instance group The collection of VM instances that you can manage as a single entity. region > network > subnet > zone > instance group > Classic Application Load Balancer External passthrough Network Load Balancer External proxy Network Load Balancer The base entity for external load balancer components, such as the forwarding rule and backend service. external load balancing > load balancer Internal load balancer The base entity for internal load balancer components, such as the forwarding rule and backend service. internal load balancing > load balancer Cloud NAT gateway A NAT gateway region > network > NATs > NAT gateway VPC Network Peering A VPC peering endpoint that is shown when you don't have permissions to view the peer network.
- In the Infrastructure view, the insights for metrics for the selected hour on the timeline include the following: High egress instances: aggregated hourly values for various types of egress High egress instance groups: aggregated hourly values for various types of egress In the GKE Enterprise view available for GKE Enterprise projects, the insights for metrics for the selected hour on the timeline include the following: High egress GKE workloads: aggregated hourly values for various types of egress for GKE workloads, in the GKE Enterprise view Filter the traffic based on the traffic types You can further filter the traffic based on the following traffic types: All egress traffic for an entity Cross-zonal egress traffic: useful for analyzing billable traffic Egress to internet: used for analyzing billable traffic and for analyzing the traffic that reaches external endpoints Hybrid egress: used to analyze the volume of traffic to on-premises, including Cloud Interconnect, Cloud VPN, and Router appliance connections In the GKE Enterprise view, you can further filter the traffic based on the following traffic types: All measured egress traffic from the selected entity Cross-zonal egress traffic: useful for analyzing billable traffic between Google Cloud zones Multiple projects Network Topology visualizes resources in your project, or you can use Cloud Monitoring, which can visualize metrics for multiple Google Cloud projects.
- Metrics for the selected hour on the timeline include the following: Average hourly throughput available for most entities Average hourly packet loss available for traffic within Google Cloud regions and zones Hourly median latency (RTT) available for many entity types In the GKE Enterprise view available for GKE Enterprise projects, the metrics for the selected hour on the timeline also include the following: Average hourly throughput available for most entities Median latency available for traffic within Google Cloud regions and zones with GKE clusters Network verdict metrics displaying the GKE workloads with the most dropped and most forwarded traffic flows for the selected cluster You can also download the table of outliers in a CSV format for the High egress and Network verdict traffic insights.
- Base entity Icon Description Aggregation hierarchy (top to bottom) GKE Pod The base entity for GKE entities such as clusters, workloads, and namespaces. region > network > subnet > zone > GKE cluster > GKE namespace > GKE workload > GKE pod GKE Workload A GKE workload region > network > subnet > zone > GKE cluster > GKE namespace > GKE workload GKE namespace A GKE namespace region > network > subnet > zone > GKE cluster > GKE namespace GKE cluster A GKE cluster region > network > subnet > zone > GKE cluster Note: In the topology view and as part of the Pod metrics, Network Topology does not show the IPv6 IP address of the dual stack Pods.

Evidence snippets:
- Route advertisements and internal IP addresses The following IP addresses are advertised within a VPC network: Regional internal IPv4 addresses Used for primary and secondary IPv4 subnet address ranges Regional internal and external IPv6 addresses Used for internal and external IPv6 subnet address ranges Global internal IPv4 addresses Used for Private Service Connect endpoints for Google APIs If you connect VPC networks using VPC Network Peering, subnet ranges using private IPv4 addresses are always exchanged.
- Internet access requirements The following criteria must be satisfied for an instance to have outgoing internet access: The network must have a valid default internet gateway route or custom route whose destination IP range is the most general ( 0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4, ::/0 for IPv6).
- Considerations for auto mode VPC networks Auto mode VPC networks are easy to set up and use, and they are well suited for use cases with these attributes: Having subnets automatically created in each region is useful.
- For one instance to be able to communicate with another, appropriate firewall rules must also be configured because every network has an implied deny firewall rule for ingress traffic.
