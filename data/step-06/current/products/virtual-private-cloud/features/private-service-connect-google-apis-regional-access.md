- Endpoints Private Service Connect endpoints are internal IP addresses in a consumer VPC network that can be directly accessed by clients in that network.
- Similarly, a Private Service Connect endpoint can be used to access Google APIs such as Cloud Storage or BigQuery.
- Private Service Connect can be used to access managed services that are owned by Google, third-party software as a service (SaaS) companies, or other teams within the consumer's own company.

- Other Google services are hosted in VPC networks and can be accessed by using the following methods: To connect to services that are published using the Service Networking API , see private services access .
- VM A1 can access Google APIs and services, including Cloud Storage, because its network interface is located in subnet-a , which has Private Google Access enabled.
- Private Google Access has no effect on whether or not these instances can access Google APIs and services because both have external IP addresses.
