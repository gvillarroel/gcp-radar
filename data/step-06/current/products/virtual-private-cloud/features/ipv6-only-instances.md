- For instances with IPv6 addresses, the IPv6 address comes from the range of available IP addresses in the selected shared subnet's IPv6 subnet range.
- Instances in service projects attached to a host project that uses the same Shared VPC network can communicate internally with one another by using either their internal IPv4 addresses or their internal or external IPv6 addresses, subject to applicable firewall rules .
- The internal IPv4 or IPv6 address object must be created in the same service project as the resource that uses it, even though the value of the IP address comes from the available IP addresses of the selected shared subnet in a Shared VPC network.

- VPC Network Peering also provides certain external IPv6 connectivity to the destination external IPv6 address ranges of the following resources when the routes to those destination external IPv6 addresses are exchanged by VPC Network Peering: Dual-stack and IPv6-only virtual machine (VM) instance network interfaces Forwarding rules for external protocol forwarding Forwarding rules for external passthrough Network Load Balancers VPC Network Peering supports both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.
- If the firewall rules are correctly configured, only vm-a1 and vm-b can communicate with an on-premises resource with IPv4 address 10.5.6.7 (or IPv6 address fc:1000:1000:10a0:29b:: ) because that is the only VM in the same region as the Cloud Router.
- For VPC firewall rules: Firewall rules whose targets are defined using network tags are only resolved to instances in the firewall rule's VPC network.
