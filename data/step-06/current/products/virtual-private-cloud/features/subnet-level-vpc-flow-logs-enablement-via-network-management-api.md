Evidence snippets:
- An organization-level VPC Flow Logs configuration enables flow logs for all subnets, VLAN attachments, and Cloud VPN tunnels in all VPC networks in the organization.
- At the project level, you can enable VPC Flow Logs for specific VPC networks, subnets, VLAN attachments, and Cloud VPN tunnels.
- Configuration scope Generates flow logs for these resources Steps to enable Organization All VM instances and Cloud Run resources in all subnets in the organization All VLAN attachments in the organization All Cloud VPN tunnels in the organization Enable VPC Flow Logs for an organization VPC network All VM instances and Cloud Run resources in all subnets in the VPC network All VLAN attachments in the VPC network All Cloud VPN tunnels in the VPC network Enable VPC Flow Logs for a VPC network Subnet All VM instances and Cloud Run resources in a specific subnet Enable VPC Flow Logs for a subnet: Recommended: Enable VPC Flow Logs for a subnet (Network Management API) Enable VPC Flow Logs for a subnet (Compute Engine API) VLAN attachment A specific VLAN attachment Enable VPC Flow Logs for a VLAN attachment Cloud VPN tunnel A specific Cloud VPN tunnel Enable VPC Flow Logs for a Cloud VPN tunnel You can use filtering to customize these configuration scopes.
- For example, if an incident occurs, you can examine the following: Which IP addresses have communicated with each other and when Which IPs are compromised by analyzing all the incoming and outgoing network flows Supported configurations You can enable VPC Flow Logs at the organization and project levels.

- Cross-project annotations If VPC Flow Logs is enabled at the organization level , flows through Shared VPC, VPC Network Peering, and Network Connectivity Center are annotated with cross-project annotations.
- 3 If VPC Flow Logs is configured at the organization level, by default, log records for cross-project flows include details about both sides of the flow.
- If VPC Flow Logs is enabled at the project level, flows between resources in different projects aren't annotated with cross-project annotations.
- VPC Flow Logs is configured at the organization level, and cross-project annotations aren't disabled.
