Evidence snippets:
- About VPC Flow Logs records This page describes the VPC Flow Logs record format, including which base and metadata fields are available.
- If you select custom metadata, you can specify the metadata fields that you want to include by the parent field, such as src vpc , or by their full names, such as src vpc.project id When new metadata fields are added to the record format, they're excluded from the flow logs unless they're within a parent field that you have specified to include.
- You can filter on any subset of fields listed in Record format , except for the following fields: rtt msec bytes sent packets sent start time end time VPC Flow Logs filtering uses CEL, an embedded expression language for attribute-based logic expressions.
- VPC Flow Logs can't add Pod annotations because, for packets to the internet, the masquerade agent translates the Pod IP address to the node IP address before VPC Flow Logs sees the packet.

Evidence snippets:
- Before setting the MTU to a value higher than 1460 , review Maximum transmission unit . module "test-vpc-module" { source = "terraform-google-modules/network/google" version = " > 16.0" project id = var.project id # Replace this with your project ID in quotes network name = "my-custom-mode-network" mtu = 1460 subnets = [ { subnet name = "subnet-01" subnet ip = "10.10.10.0/24" subnet region = "us-west1" }, { subnet name = "subnet-02" subnet ip = "10.10.20.0/24" subnet region = "us-west1" subnet private access = "true" subnet flow logs = "true" }, { subnet name = "subnet-03" subnet ip = "10.10.30.0/24" subnet region = "us-west1" subnet flow logs = "true" subnet flow logs interval = "INTERVAL 10 MIN" subnet flow logs sampling = 0.7 subnet flow logs metadata = "INCLUDE ALL METADATA" subnet flow logs filter = "false" } ] } Next, create firewall rules .
- The per network limits describe the maximum number of secondary ranges that you can define for each subnet. --enable-flow-logs : Enables VPC Flow Logs in the subnet at creation time. --enable-private-ip-google-access : Enables Private Google Access in the subnet at creation time. --purpose : Enables you to specify the purpose of the subnet . --role : Enables you to specify a role (active or backup) for a proxy-only subnet .
- For more information about this constraint and its effects on subnet creation and updates, see Organization policy constraints for VPC Flow Logs .
- Flow logs : Choose whether to enable VPC flow logs for the subnet when you create it or later by editing it.

- Configuration scope Generates flow logs for these resources Steps to enable Organization All VM instances and Cloud Run resources in all subnets in the organization All VLAN attachments in the organization All Cloud VPN tunnels in the organization Enable VPC Flow Logs for an organization VPC network All VM instances and Cloud Run resources in all subnets in the VPC network All VLAN attachments in the VPC network All Cloud VPN tunnels in the VPC network Enable VPC Flow Logs for a VPC network Subnet All VM instances and Cloud Run resources in a specific subnet Enable VPC Flow Logs for a subnet: Recommended: Enable VPC Flow Logs for a subnet (Network Management API) Enable VPC Flow Logs for a subnet (Compute Engine API) VLAN attachment A specific VLAN attachment Enable VPC Flow Logs for a VLAN attachment Cloud VPN tunnel A specific Cloud VPN tunnel Enable VPC Flow Logs for a Cloud VPN tunnel You can use filtering to customize these configuration scopes.
- VPC Flow Logs samples the following packets: Packets that are sent from and received by virtual machine (VM) instances , including instances used as Google Kubernetes Engine nodes Packets that are sent from and received by Cloud Run resources configured with Direct VPC egress Packets that are sent through VLAN attachments for Cloud Interconnect and Cloud VPN tunnels You can view flow logs in Cloud Logging , and you can export logs to any destination that Cloud Logging export supports.
- You can: Monitor the VPC network Perform network diagnosis Filter the flow logs by VMs, serverless endpoints, VLAN attachments, and Cloud VPN tunnels to understand traffic changes Understand traffic growth for capacity forecasting Understanding network usage and optimizing network traffic expenses You can analyze network usage with VPC Flow Logs to optimize network traffic expenses.

- Final score: 193
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- You can choose one of the following four approaches to determine which VPC Flow Logs contribute to the computed metrics and how they are evaluated: Source endpoint : the number of bytes sent or packets sent reported at the source endpoint of a flow Destination endpoint : the number of bytes sent or packets sent reported at the destination endpoint of a flow Sum of source and destination endpoint : the sum of bytes sent or packets sent reported by both endpoints of a flow Average of source and destination endpoint : an average of bytes sent or packets sent reported by both endpoints of a flow if both the source and the destination information are available in VPC Flow Logs Traffic deduplication To prevent traffic reported at the source and destination VMs from being counted twice, you can choose the Average of source and destination endpoint sampling option.
- In Flow Analyzer, you can do the following: Query logs reported by VPC Flow Logs Use SQL filters to refine your queries Sort query results by total traffic, aggregate packets, or latency View traffic for a specific time period View the top five flows with the highest traffic or latency, for the selected time period View resources with the highest traffic or latency, for the selected time period View traffic details for specific source and destination pairs in your query results How it works VPC Flow Logs samples packets in your VPC network to generate flow logs, which can be stored in Cloud Logging or routed to supported destinations, such as BigQuery or a third-party platform through Pub/Sub.
- Flow Analyzer lets you quickly and efficiently understand your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) traffic flows without the need to write complex SQL queries for analyzing VPC Flow Logs.
- Flow Analyzer organizes the flow logs for aggregation in the following ways: Source and destination : this option uses the SRC and DEST information included in VPC Flow Logs.
