- BYOIP-provided external IPv6 subnet ranges can only be used for external /96 IPv6 address ranges of VM network interfaces.
- Forwarding rule for an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, external passthrough Network Load Balancer, or protocol forwarding /96 or specified by a BYOIP sub-prefix The IPv6 address range of a forwarding rule for internal protocol forwarding or an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer is an internal /96 IP address range from a subnet's internal IPv6 address range.
- External /96 IPv6 address ranges of forwarding rules for external protocol forwarding or backend service-based external passthrough Network Load Balancers can use the second half ( /65 ) of the subnet's /64 range.

- August 08, 2022 Feature Internal and external IPv6 addresses are available in all regions in General Availability : Subnets : Dual-stack subnets that have both IPv4 and IPv6 subnet ranges.
- May 28, 2025 Feature You can assign IPv6 bring your own IP (BYOIP) addresses to a subnet's external address range.
- To reserve addresses from these ranges, create a static regional external IPv6 address with the VM endpoint type.
- IPv6 BYOIP addresses can be used with external passthrough Network Load Balancers .

- A dual-stack subnet can have one of the following configurations for its primary IP address ranges: Internal IPv4 range and internal IPv6 range Internal IPv4 range and external IPv6 range Each subnet in a VPC network can have a different configuration; you don't need to configure them all as dual-stack, for example.
