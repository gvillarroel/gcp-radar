- System-generated routes System-generated default routes 0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4 ::/0 for IPv6 default-internet-gateway Applies to the whole VPC network Can be removed or replaced Subnet routes Each subnet has at least one subnet route for each IP address range that is associated with the subnet.
- When you create a subnet that has an external IPv6 address range, Google Cloud adds a system-generated IPv6 default route to the VPC network if it doesn't already have one.
- The system-generated IPv6 default route is a local static route that has a ::/0 destination and default internet gateway next hop.

- Route advertisements and internal IP addresses The following IP addresses are advertised within a VPC network: Regional internal IPv4 addresses Used for primary and secondary IPv4 subnet address ranges Regional internal and external IPv6 addresses Used for internal and external IPv6 subnet address ranges Global internal IPv4 addresses Used for Private Service Connect endpoints for Google APIs If you connect VPC networks using VPC Network Peering, subnet ranges using private IPv4 addresses are always exchanged.
- Subnets with IPv6 address ranges aren't supported in the following: Auto mode VPC networks, including the default network Legacy networks If you have an auto mode VPC network that you would like to add subnets with IPv6 address ranges to, you can do the following: Convert the auto mode network to custom mode .
