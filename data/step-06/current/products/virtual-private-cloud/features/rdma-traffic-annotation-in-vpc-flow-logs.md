- Route type Route export conditions Route import conditions Dynamic IPv4 routes Not exported by default Export is controlled by using the --export-custom-routes flag Not imported by default Import is controlled by using the --import-custom-routes flag Dynamic IPv6 routes Not exported by default Export is controlled by using the --export-custom-routes flag when the stack type of the peering is set to --stack-type=IPV4 IPV6 Not imported by default Import is controlled by using the --import-custom-routes flag when the stack type of the peering is set to --stack-type=IPV4 IPV6 Benefits of exchanging static and dynamic routes When one VPC network exports static and dynamic routes and the other VPC network imports those routes, the importing network can send packets directly to the next hop for each imported static or dynamic route whose next hop is in the peer VPC network.
