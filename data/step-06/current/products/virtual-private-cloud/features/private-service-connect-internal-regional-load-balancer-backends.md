- Backends let you create configurations such as the following: Customer-owned domains and certificates in front of managed services Consumer-controlled failover between managed services in different regions Centralized security configuration and access control for managed services The following diagram shows an internal Application Load Balancer deployed with Private Service Connect backends that reference a published service.
- Backends are deployed by using network endpoint groups (NEGs) that let consumers direct traffic to their load balancer before reaching a Private Service Connect service.
- Backends Private Service Connect backends let Google Cloud load balancers send traffic through Private Service Connect to reach published services or Google APIs.

- Route advertisements and internal IP addresses The following IP addresses are advertised within a VPC network: Regional internal IPv4 addresses Used for primary and secondary IPv4 subnet address ranges Regional internal and external IPv6 addresses Used for internal and external IPv6 subnet address ranges Global internal IPv4 addresses Used for Private Service Connect endpoints for Google APIs If you connect VPC networks using VPC Network Peering, subnet ranges using private IPv4 addresses are always exchanged.
- When you connect a VPC network to another network, such as an on-premises network, using a Google Cloud connectivity product like Cloud VPN, Cloud Interconnect, or Router appliance: You can advertise the VPC network's internal IP addresses to another network (such as an on-premises network).
- Though connectivity between a VPC network and another network (such as an on-premises network) can use private routing provided by a Google Cloud connectivity product, the other network's IP addresses might also be publicly routable.
