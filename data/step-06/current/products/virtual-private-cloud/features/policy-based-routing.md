# Policy-based routing

Product: Virtual Private Cloud
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Policy-based routing is now generally available, allowing next-hop selection based on protocol and source IP in addition to destination IP; Policy-based routing became available in preview and supports selecting a next hop using protocol and source IP matching instead of only destination IP.

## Extended Definition

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 155
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Though connectivity between a VPC network and another network (such as an on-premises network) can use private routing provided by a Google Cloud connectivity product, the other network's IP addresses might also be publicly routable.
- Methodology: Intra-zone latency is monitored via a blackbox prober that constantly runs netperf TCP RR benchmark between a pair of c2-types VMs in every zone c2 instances are available.
- Important: Probe loss statistics are a component of traceroute tests, but care must be taken when analyzing test results. traceroute and mtr by default utilize ICMP-based probing.
- You can disable the creation of default networks by creating an organization policy with the compute.skipDefaultNetworkCreation constraint.

### "About accessing published services through endpoints \_|\_ Virtual Private\

- Source ID: `site-docs-root-2`
- Final score: 145
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Advanced traffic management and security : When you access a published service through a consumer load balancer, the load balancer can act as a centralized policy enforcement point where security policies (such as Google Cloud Armor policies and SSL policies ) or routing policies (such as Google Cloud URL maps ) are enforced.
- Target producer Consumer configuration (endpoint) Consumer global access Hybrid access Automatic DNS configuration (IPv4-only) VPC Network Peering access NCC connection propagation (IPv4 only) Supported target services for IPv4 endpoints Supported target services for IPv6 endpoints Cross-region internal Application Load Balancer IPv4 services IPv4 services Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer Only if global access is enabled on the load balancer ( known issue ) IPv4 services IPv4 services IPv6 services Internal protocol forwarding (target instance) Only if global access is enabled on the producer forwarding rule ( known issue ) IPv4 services IPv4 services IPv6 services Port mapping services Only if global access is enabled on the producer forwarding rule IPv4 services IPv4 services IPv6 services Regional internal Application Load Balancer Only if global access is enabled on the load balancer before the service attachment is created IPv4 services IPv4 services Regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer Only if global access is enabled on the load balancer before the service attachment is created IPv4 services IPv4 services Secure Web Proxy IPv4 services IPv4 services Producer configuration This table summarizes the supported configuration options and capabilities of published services that are accessed by endpoints .
- Organization policy constraints An Organization Policy Administrator can use the constraints/compute.disablePrivateServiceConnectCreationForConsumers constraint to define the set of endpoint types for which users cannot create forwarding rules.
- If you connect a global access endpoint to a service that isn't configured for global access, traffic might be sent to unhealthy backends and dropped ( known issue ).
