can route flow logs from Logging to a destination of your choice as described in the Routing and storage overview in the Logging documentation.
- In the query editor field, enter a query: For example, to view flow logs for a specific source Cloud VPN tunnel, enter the following query: resource.type="vpc flow logs config" logName="projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/networkmanagement.googleapis.com%2Fvpc flows" jsonPayload.reporter="SRC GATEWAY" labels.target resource name="projects/ PROJECT NUMBER /regions/ REGION /vpnTunnels/ NAME " Replace the following: PROJECT ID : the Google Cloud project ID of the Cloud VPN tunnel PROJECT NUMBER : the project number of the Cloud VPN tunnel REGION : the region of the Cloud VPN tunnel NAME : the name of the Cloud VPN tunnel If you enabled VPC Flow Logs for a subnet by using the Compute Engine API, the query must target compute.googleapis.com .
- Log Resource type and log name networkmanagement.googleapis.com/vpc flows Collects logs for configurations that are managed by the Network Management API. resource.type="vpc flow logs config" logName="projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/networkmanagement.googleapis.com%2Fvpc flows" compute.googleapis.com/vpc flows Collects logs for configurations that are managed by the Compute Engine API. resource.type="gce subnetwork" logName="projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fvpc flows" Replace PROJECT ID with the Google Cloud project ID of the reporting resource.
- A resource is associated with more than one configuration if you create multiple configurations per resource or if you create multiple configurations and their scopes overlap as described in the following list: VPC Flow Logs is configured for the organization, and you have additional configurations for the organization or VPC networks, subnets, VLAN attachments, or Cloud VPN tunnels in any of the organization's projects.

Evidence snippets:
- VPC Flow Logs samples TCP, UDP, ICMP, ESP, GRE, and RDMA flows: Both inbound and outbound flows are sampled.
- Configuration scope Generates flow logs for these resources Steps to enable Organization All VM instances and Cloud Run resources in all subnets in the organization All VLAN attachments in the organization All Cloud VPN tunnels in the organization Enable VPC Flow Logs for an organization VPC network All VM instances and Cloud Run resources in all subnets in the VPC network All VLAN attachments in the VPC network All Cloud VPN tunnels in the VPC network Enable VPC Flow Logs for a VPC network Subnet All VM instances and Cloud Run resources in a specific subnet Enable VPC Flow Logs for a subnet: Recommended: Enable VPC Flow Logs for a subnet (Network Management API) Enable VPC Flow Logs for a subnet (Compute Engine API) VLAN attachment A specific VLAN attachment Enable VPC Flow Logs for a VLAN attachment Cloud VPN tunnel A specific Cloud VPN tunnel Enable VPC Flow Logs for a Cloud VPN tunnel You can use filtering to customize these configuration scopes.
- VPC Flow Logs samples the following packets: Packets that are sent from and received by virtual machine (VM) instances , including instances used as Google Kubernetes Engine nodes Packets that are sent from and received by Cloud Run resources configured with Direct VPC egress Packets that are sent through VLAN attachments for Cloud Interconnect and Cloud VPN tunnels You can view flow logs in Cloud Logging , and you can export logs to any destination that Cloud Logging export supports.
- You can: Monitor the VPC network Perform network diagnosis Filter the flow logs by VMs, serverless endpoints, VLAN attachments, and Cloud VPN tunnels to understand traffic changes Understand traffic growth for capacity forecasting Understanding network usage and optimizing network traffic expenses You can analyze network usage with VPC Flow Logs to optimize network traffic expenses.

- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 160
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Metric type Flow Analyzer uses RTT data from VPC Flow Logs to provide latency analysis for TCP traffic.
- You can choose one of the following four approaches to determine which VPC Flow Logs contribute to the computed metrics and how they are evaluated: Source endpoint : the number of bytes sent or packets sent reported at the source endpoint of a flow Destination endpoint : the number of bytes sent or packets sent reported at the destination endpoint of a flow Sum of source and destination endpoint : the sum of bytes sent or packets sent reported by both endpoints of a flow Average of source and destination endpoint : an average of bytes sent or packets sent reported by both endpoints of a flow if both the source and the destination information are available in VPC Flow Logs Traffic deduplication To prevent traffic reported at the source and destination VMs from being counted twice, you can choose the Average of source and destination endpoint sampling option.
- In Flow Analyzer, you can do the following: Query logs reported by VPC Flow Logs Use SQL filters to refine your queries Sort query results by total traffic, aggregate packets, or latency View traffic for a specific time period View the top five flows with the highest traffic or latency, for the selected time period View resources with the highest traffic or latency, for the selected time period View traffic details for specific source and destination pairs in your query results How it works VPC Flow Logs samples packets in your VPC network to generate flow logs, which can be stored in Cloud Logging or routed to supported destinations, such as BigQuery or a third-party platform through Pub/Sub.
- Flow Analyzer lets you quickly and efficiently understand your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) traffic flows without the need to write complex SQL queries for analyzing VPC Flow Logs.
