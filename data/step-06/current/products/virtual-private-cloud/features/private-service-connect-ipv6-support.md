Evidence snippets:
- To create an IPv4-only Private Service Connect subnet, do the following: POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /subnetworks { "ipCidrRange": " SUBNET RANGE ", "name": " SUBNET NAME ", "network": "projects/ PROJECT ID /global/networks/ NETWORK NAME ", "purpose": "PRIVATE SERVICE CONNECT" } To create a dual-stack Private Service Connect subnet, do the following: POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /subnetworks { "ipCidrRange": " SUBNET RANGE ", "name": " SUBNET NAME ", "network": "projects/ PROJECT ID /global/networks/ NETWORK NAME ", "purpose": "PRIVATE SERVICE CONNECT", "stackType": "IPV4 IPV6", "ipv6AccessType": "INTERNAL" } To create an IPv6-only Private Service Connect subnet, do the following: POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ PROJECT ID /regions/ REGION /subnetworks { "name": " SUBNET NAME ", "network": "projects/ PROJECT ID /global/networks/ NETWORK NAME ", "purpose": "PRIVATE SERVICE CONNECT", "stackType": "IPV6 ONLY", "ipv6AccessType": "INTERNAL" } Replace the following: PROJECT ID : the project for the subnet.
- Private Service Connect provides two methods to connect to published services: Endpoints (based on a forwarding rule) Backends (based on a load balancer) These endpoint types require slightly different producer configurations.
- To create an IPv4-only Private Service Connect subnet, do the following: gcloud compute networks subnets create SUBNET NAME \ --network= NETWORK NAME \ --region= REGION \ --range= SUBNET RANGE \ --purpose=PRIVATE SERVICE CONNECT To create a dual-stack Private Service Connect subnet, do the following: gcloud compute networks subnets create SUBNET NAME \ --network= NETWORK NAME \ --region= REGION \ --stack-type=IPV4 IPV6 \ --ipv6-access-type=INTERNAL \ --range= SUBNET RANGE \ --purpose=PRIVATE SERVICE CONNECT To create an IPv6-only Private Service Connect subnet, do the following: gcloud compute networks subnets create SUBNET NAME \ --network= NETWORK NAME \ --region= REGION \ --stack-type=IPV6 ONLY \ --ipv6-access-type=INTERNAL \ --purpose=PRIVATE SERVICE CONNECT Replace the following: SUBNET NAME : the name to assign to the subnet.
- When you configure ingress firewall rules for backend services, the source of traffic depends on the type of load balancer that your service uses: Category Source of traffic to backends Passthrough load balancers: Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer Internal protocol forwarding Port mapping service The IP address ranges of the Private Service Connect (NAT) subnets associated with the service Proxy load balancers: Cross-region internal Application Load Balancer Regional internal Application Load Balancer Regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer Secure Web Proxy The IP address ranges of the associated proxy-only subnets Services with health checks The probe IP address ranges of your load balancer type Publish a service To publish a service, you create a service attachment.

- For instructions that include creating a load balancer with a Private Service Connect backend, see the following: Create an internal Application Load Balancer to access Google APIs Create a global external Application Load Balancer to access a published service Roles The Compute Load Balancer Admin role ( roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin ) contains the permission required to perform the tasks described in this guide.
- Create a Private Service Connect NEG When you create a NEG, you choose which type of target it connects to: A published service A regional Google API A global Google API Create a NEG to connect to a published service When you create a Private Service Connect NEG that points to a published service, you need the service attachment URI for the service.
