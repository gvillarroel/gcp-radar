- Backends let you create configurations such as the following: Customer-owned domains and certificates in front of managed services Consumer-controlled failover between managed services in different regions Centralized security configuration and access control for managed services The following diagram shows an internal Application Load Balancer deployed with Private Service Connect backends that reference a published service.
- Backends are deployed by using network endpoint groups (NEGs) that let consumers direct traffic to their load balancer before reaching a Private Service Connect service.
- Private Service Connect lets you send traffic to endpoints and backends that forward the traffic to managed services, including Google APIs and published services.

- A dual-stack subnet can have one of the following configurations for its primary IP address ranges: Internal IPv4 range and internal IPv6 range Internal IPv4 range and external IPv6 range Each subnet in a VPC network can have a different configuration; you don't need to configure them all as dual-stack, for example.
- If you want to configure internal IPv6 address ranges on subnets in this network, complete these steps: In the Private IPv6 address settings section, select Configure a ULA internal IPv6 range for this VPC Network .
- To configure internal IPv6 address ranges on subnets in this network, complete these steps: In the Private IPv6 address settings section, select Configure a ULA internal IPv6 range for this VPC Network .
