- To read your Google Cloud project-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : projects/ PROJECT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --project= PROJECT ID To read your folder-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : folders/ FOLDER ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --folder= FOLDER ID To read your organization-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : organizations/ ORGANIZATION ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --organization= ORGANIZATION ID To read your Cloud Billing account-level audit log entries, run the following command: gcloud logging read "logName : billingAccounts/ BILLING ACCOUNT ID /logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com" \ --billing-account= BILLING ACCOUNT ID Add the --freshness flag to your command to read logs that are more than 1 day old.
- Service name App Engine audit logs use the service name appengine.googleapis.com .

Evidence snippets:
- To move from your own SSL certificates to Google-managed SSL certificates, or to add managed SSL certificates to an existing app with a custom domain, update your domain mapping: In the Google Cloud console, go to App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains : Go to Custom Domains Select the domain you want to secure, and click Enable managed security .
- After mapping a custom domain to your application and updating your DNS records , App Engine provisions a managed SSL certificate, renews the certificate, and revokes it when you remove the custom domain from your application.
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
- Disable managed SSL certificates To disable managed SSL certificates: In the Google Cloud console, go to App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains : Go to Custom Domains Select the domain and click Disable managed security .
