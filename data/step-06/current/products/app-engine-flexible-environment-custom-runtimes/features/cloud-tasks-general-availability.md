- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- The following limits apply to task queues according to their type: Push Queue Limits Maximum task size 100KB Queue execution rate 500 task invocations per second per queue Maximum countdown/ETA for a task 30 days from the current date and time Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a batch 100 tasks Maximum number of tasks that can be added in a transaction 5 tasks Default maximum number of task queues 100 queues.
- The Cloud Quotas system does the following: Monitors your consumption of Google Cloud products and services Restricts your consumption of those resources Provides a way to request changes to the quota value and automate quota adjustments In most cases, when you attempt to consume more of a resource than its quota allows, the system blocks access to the resource, and the task that you're trying to perform fails.
- Task Queue When a task executes, its associated requests count toward the application request quotas These limits apply to all task queues: Resource Daily limit Maximum rate Task Queue management calls (using the Google Cloud console) 10,000 n/a Resource Default limit Maximum number of queues (includes both push and pull queues but not the default queue) 100 queues.
- The Search API imposes these limits to ensure the reliability of the service: 100 aggregated minutes of query execution time per minute, within an app and an index .

Evidence snippets:
- With Cloud Tasks, HTTP requests are long-lived and return a response only after any asynchronous work ends.
- For long-running jobs, we recommend using Cloud Tasks .
- Avoid performing background work in your app, and review your code to make sure all asynchronous operations finish before you deliver your response.
- Handling asynchronous background work Background work is any work that your app performs for a request after you have delivered your HTTP response.
