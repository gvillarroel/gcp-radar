- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- App Engine continues to send health check requests and restarts the instance if an unhealthy instance continues to fail to respond to a predetermined number of consecutive health checks.
- As the instance goes through these health checks, the App Engine logs can indicate that the instance is in any of the following states: Healthy .
- If you need to extend the default behavior of split health checks to your application, you can customize the app.yaml file to configure two types of health checks: Liveness checks detect that a VM instance and its container are running.
- Health checking App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance is running, and to check that an instance is fully started and ready to accept incoming requests.

Evidence snippets:
- COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf create log dir configured in nginx.conf RUN mkdir -p /var/log/app engine Create a simple file to handle health checks.
- Google App Engine will send an HTTP request to / ah/health and any 2xx or 404 response is considered healthy.
- Enable billing in your new Google Cloud project by creating a new billing account or setting an existing one: Go to Billing Download and install the Google Cloud CLI and then initialize the gcloud CLI: Download the SDK Run the following gcloud command to create an App Engine application and specify in which geographical region that you want your app to run: gcloud app create Due to changes in the default behavior for how Cloud Build uses service accounts in new projects, and secure-by-default organization policy changes , you might need to grant additional roles to your deploying service account.
