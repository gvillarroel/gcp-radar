Evidence snippets:
- You can see a complete list of table upload options by visiting the Table Manifest guide or with: earthengine upload table -h external image To create an asset backed by an external image, run the upload image command with a manifest: earthengine upload external image --manifest /tmp/foo.json An example manifest is: { "name" : "projects/{project}/assets/cogdemo1" , "tilesets" : [ { "id" : "0" , "sources" : [{ "uris" : [ "gs://ee-docs-demos/COG demo.tif" ] }] } ], "properties" : { "source" : "https://code.earthengine.google.com/d541cf8b268b2f9d8f834c255698201d" }, "startTime" : "2016-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z" , "endTime" : "2016-12-31T15:01:23.000000000Z" } See the Cloud GeoTIFF guide and the Image Manifest guide for more details on constructing the manifest.
- The options are also described in the Image Manifest guide. table To upload a Shapefile, CSV, or TFRecord from Google Cloud Storage to an Earth Engine table asset, you can use any of: earthengine upload table --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/myUploadedShapefile gs://bucket/foo.shp earthengine upload table --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/myUploadedCSV gs://bucket/foo.csv earthengine upload table --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/myUploadedTFRecord gs://bucket/foo.tfrecord Note: when uploading Shapefiles, you only need to specify the path to the .shp file.
- You can learn more about the options for uploading images to Earth Engine in Uploading image assets: Advanced options .
- This will control how Earth Engine generates the pyramid of lower-resolution versions of your image: earthengine upload image --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/asset id --pyramiding policy=sample gs://bucket/image.tif You can use the --last band alpha to indicate that the mask for the image should be taken from an alpha channel in the last band: earthengine upload image --asset id=projects/my-project/assets/asset id --last band alpha gs://bucket/image.tif You can specify a no-data value using the --nodata value flag.

Evidence snippets:
- For more advanced options or externally trained models, integration with Vertex AI is provided, allowing models to be brought to Earth Engine's data or enabling the construction of deep learning models and neural network-based analyses.
- Page Summary outlined flag Google Earth Engine is a Google Cloud product that combines a large catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale computation for environmental research and applications.
- When ready, users can export raster and vector results to Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Google Drive, as well as download data locally in formats compatible with pandas, NumPy, and Xarray.
- It combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale computation to accelerate environmental research and applications.
