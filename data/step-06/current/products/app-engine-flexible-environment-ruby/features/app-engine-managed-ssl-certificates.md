### "Secure custom domains with SSL \_|\_ App Engine flexible environment \_\

- Final score: 173
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- To move from your own SSL certificates to Google-managed SSL certificates, or to add managed SSL certificates to an existing app with a custom domain, update your domain mapping: In the Google Cloud console, go to App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains : Go to Custom Domains Select the domain you want to secure, and click Enable managed security .
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
- Disable managed SSL certificates To disable managed SSL certificates: In the Google Cloud console, go to App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains : Go to Custom Domains Select the domain and click Disable managed security .
- To use and manage your own SSL certificates instead of Google-managed certificates: Make sure you have already set up your custom domain in your App Engine project.

- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
- Retrieve the DNS record information for your domain mappings: In the Google Cloud console, go to the Custom Domains tab of the App Engine Settings page.
- In addition, if you have other App Engine apps mapped to other subdomains, those mappings also have higher priority than any wildcard mapping.
- If you encounter the limit, App Engine keeps trying to issue managed certificates until all requests have been fulfilled.

### "How requests are routed \_|\_ App Engine flexible environment \_|\_ Google\

Evidence snippets:
- Inconsistent metrics when App Engine flexible environment uses Cloud Load Balancing The App Engine flexible environment dashboard displays all metrics only for requests routed through a flexible environment managed backend.
- Example URLs Here are some examples of URLs for App Engine, showing both the appspot.com domain that App Engine assigns to your app and a custom domain, which you can set up for your app .
- Otherwise, users can use your app's App Engine URL to bypass the load balancer, Cloud Armor security policies, SSL certificates, and private keys that are passed through the load balancer.
- Reuse the same SSL certificates and private keys that you use for Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Cloud Storage.
