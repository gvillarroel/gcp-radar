# Updated health checks

Product: App Engine flexible environment Ruby
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Updated health checks are the newer default health check system for new App Engine projects; Updated health checks provide separate liveness and readiness checks to confirm an instance is running and ready to serve content.

## Extended Definition

Evidence snippets:
- If you need to extend the default behavior of split health checks to your application, you can customize the app.yaml file to configure two types of health checks: Liveness checks detect that a VM instance and its container are running.
- By default, these health checks are enabled and are known as split health checks .
- App Engine continues to send health check requests and restarts the instance if an unhealthy instance continues to fail to respond to a predetermined number of consecutive health checks.
- As the instance goes through these health checks, the App Engine logs can indicate that the instance is in any of the following states: Healthy .

Evidence snippets:
- If your App Engine flexible environment app is not configured to use Shared VPC , the App Engine flexible environment creates up to two hidden VPC firewall rules, depending on whether your app uses split health checks (default) or legacy health checks.
- Direction of traffic : Ingress Action on match : Allow Source IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 and 130.211.0.0/22 Protocols and ports : tcp : 8443 (for legacy health checks) or 10402 (for split health checks) Priority : 1000 Preventing access to cached content The App Engine firewall sits behind mechanisms that cache content, for example web proxies and browsers.
- These hidden firewall rules allow serving traffic and health check traffic to the flexible environment: Network name : The network specified in app.yaml , or the default network if no network is configured.
- Service IP range for requests sent to the App Engine standard environment IP range for requests sent to the App Engine flexible environment App Engine Cron 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32 Compute Engine instances with external IP addresses External IP address of the instance External IP address of the instance Compute Engine instances without an external IP address 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Compute Engine instances without an external IP address using Cloud NAT for outbound connections 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Cloud Scheduler jobs using App Engine HTTP and App Engine tasks in Cloud Tasks (including App Engine Task Queues) 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.2/32 Cloud Storage or Blobstore 0.1.0.30/32 Not applicable URL Fetch 0.1.0.40/32 0.1.0.40/32 Warming requests 0.1.0.3/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny Not applicable Depending on your use case, these additional instructions might apply when configuring App Engine firewall rules: Requests from newly created or updated App Engine Cron jobs sent to either the App Engine standard or flexible environment come from 0.1.0.2 .

Evidence snippets:
- COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf create log dir configured in nginx.conf RUN mkdir -p /var/log/app engine Create a simple file to handle health checks.
- Health checking can be disabled in app.yaml, but is highly recommended.
- Enable billing in your new Google Cloud project by creating a new billing account or setting an existing one: Go to Billing Download and install the Google Cloud CLI and then initialize the gcloud CLI: Download the SDK Run the following gcloud command to create an App Engine application and specify in which geographical region that you want your app to run: gcloud app create Due to changes in the default behavior for how Cloud Build uses service accounts in new projects, and secure-by-default organization policy changes , you might need to grant additional roles to your deploying service account.
