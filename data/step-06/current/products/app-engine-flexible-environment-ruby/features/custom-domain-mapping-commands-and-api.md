Evidence snippets:
- Soft routing does not apply to custom domains; requests to them will return a HTTP 404 status code if the hostname is invalid.
- You can use the simple " . " URL notation with your own custom domains and with HTTP requests.
- For example, to describe version 20191023t101741 for the default service, enter gcloud app versions describe 20191023t101741 --service=default Domain name is included in the request data The domain name used for the request is included in the request data that is passed to your app.
- Example URLs Here are some examples of URLs for App Engine, showing both the appspot.com domain that App Engine assigns to your app and a custom domain, which you can set up for your app .
