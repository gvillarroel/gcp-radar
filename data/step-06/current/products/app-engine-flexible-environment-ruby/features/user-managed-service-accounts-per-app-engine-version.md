- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
- Delegating ownership to other Google Cloud users or service accounts If you need to delegate the ownership of your domain to other users or service accounts, you can add permission through the Search Console page.
- Otherwise, users can use your app's App Engine URL to bypass the load balancer, Cloud Armor security policies, SSL certificates, and private keys that are passed through the load balancer.
- Wildcard routing rules apply to URLs that contain components for services, versions, and instances, following the service routing rules for App Engine .
