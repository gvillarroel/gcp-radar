Evidence snippets:
- OK Download the Hello World app Choose one of the following to download the Hello World sample app from GitHub, to your local machine: Clone the Hello World sample app from the following repository: git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-custom-runtimes-samples Download the sample as a .zip file and then extract it to a local directory.
- Before you begin Before running the sample app in this quickstart, you need to set up your environment and create a new Google Cloud project for App Engine: Create a new Google Cloud project by using the Google Cloud console: Open the Google Cloud console: Go to Projects Click Create Project and then name your new Google Cloud project.
- Navigate to the nginx directory where the sample code is located, for example: cd appengine-custom-runtimes-samples/nginx Running Hello World on your local machine You can test the sample app by downloading and installing Docker , and then running the Hello World container on your local machine.
- The app.yaml file must reside in the same directory as the Dockerfile file. runtime : custom env : flex The runtime: custom entry tells App Engine to look for a Dockerfile that will define your runtime's image and env: flex specifies that you are deploying to the flexible environment.
