# App-level default service account selection

Product: App Engine flexible environment Ruby
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

App Engine applications can use any configured project service account as the app-level default service account during creation and updates.

## Extended Definition

App Engine applications can use any configured project service account as the app-level default service account during creation and updates.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

Evidence snippets:
- To create a your App Engine application and assign an app-level default service account, you can use one of the following: gcloud Run the gcloud app create command: gcloud app create --service-account = SERVICE ACCOUNT NAME @ PROJECT ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com Replace: SERVICE ACCOUNT NAME with the name of the service account that you created.
- There are two types of service accounts in App Engine and any service account in your Cloud project can be assigned to act as either the app-level default or per-version service account: App-level default service account - This service account is used for all of your deployed services when you don't configure a "per-version service account".
- Specify an app-level default service account during app creation During the initial App Engine application creation process, you can choose to assign a service account that you created or use the auto-created PROJECT ID @appspot.gserviceaccount.com service account to act as the default.
- All previously deployed versions will not use the new app-level default service account until you re-deploy that version. gcloud Run the gcloud app update command. gcloud app update --service-account = SERVICE ACCOUNT NAME @ PROJECT ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com Replace: SERVICE ACCOUNT NAME with the name of the service account that you created.
