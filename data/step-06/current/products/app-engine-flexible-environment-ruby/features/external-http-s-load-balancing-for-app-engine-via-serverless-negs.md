Evidence snippets:
- Interaction with other products or services Cloud Load Balancing If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless NEGs , note the following: The load balancer does not interfere or interact with App Engine firewall rules.
- Service IP range for requests sent to the App Engine standard environment IP range for requests sent to the App Engine flexible environment App Engine Cron 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.1/32 or 0.1.0.2/32 Compute Engine instances with external IP addresses External IP address of the instance External IP address of the instance Compute Engine instances without an external IP address 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Compute Engine instances without an external IP address using Cloud NAT for outbound connections 0.0.0.0/32 0.0.0.0/32 Cloud Scheduler jobs using App Engine HTTP and App Engine tasks in Cloud Tasks (including App Engine Task Queues) 0.1.0.2/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny 0.1.0.2/32 Cloud Storage or Blobstore 0.1.0.30/32 Not applicable URL Fetch 0.1.0.40/32 0.1.0.40/32 Warming requests 0.1.0.3/32, bypasses the default firewall rule if set to deny Not applicable Depending on your use case, these additional instructions might apply when configuring App Engine firewall rules: Requests from newly created or updated App Engine Cron jobs sent to either the App Engine standard or flexible environment come from 0.1.0.2 .
- If your ingress controls are set to receive internal-and-cloud-load-balancing traffic, leave the default App Engine firewall rule as is ( allow ), and use Google Cloud Armor web application firewall (WAF) rules .
- App Engine flexible example Your app running in the flexible environment has two services: frontend service and backend service , and has a firewall configured to deny traffic by default. frontend service uses Cloud Tasks with App Engine HTTP to send messages to backend service .

- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
- App Engine SSL support offers globally distributed SSL endpoints and built-in load balancing to serve your app securely, reliably, and quickly to a worldwide audience.
- If you want Cloud Load Balancing to manage incoming requests to your custom domain, see Migrate App Engine custom domain to Cloud Load Balancing .
- SSL certificate types App Engine supports the following certificate types: Single Domain/Hostname Self-signed Wildcard Subject Alternative Name (SAN) / Multi Domain It requires some things of your certificates and keys: Private Key and Certificate should be uploaded in PEM format.

Evidence snippets:
- When HTTP(S) Load Balancing is enabled for serverless apps , you can: Configure your serverless app to serve from a dedicated IPv4 or IPv6 IP address that is not shared with other services.
- For example, you can create a dispatch file to route mobile requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/mobile/ to a mobile frontend, and route worker requests like https://simple-sample.uc.r.appspot.com/work/ to a static backend: dispatch: Send all mobile traffic to the mobile frontend. - url: " /mobile/ " service: mobile-frontend Send all work to the one static backend. - url: " /work/ " service: static-backend Deploying the dispatch file To deploy the dispatch file using gcloud , run the following command: gcloud app deploy dispatch.yaml Routing with Cloud Load Balancing Cloud Load Balancing is a separate product that enables advanced network configurations for all of your applications running on Google Cloud.
- Requests that don't pass through Cloud Load Balancing are never intercepted and rerouted by the patterns that you have defined in your dispatch file: Sends the request to an available instance of a specific service and version: https:// VERSION -dot- SERVICE -dot- PROJECT ID .
- Inconsistent metrics when App Engine flexible environment uses Cloud Load Balancing The App Engine flexible environment dashboard displays all metrics only for requests routed through a flexible environment managed backend.
