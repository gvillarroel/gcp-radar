Evidence snippets:
- Direction of traffic : Ingress Action on match : Allow Source IP ranges : 35.191.0.0/16 and 130.211.0.0/22 Protocols and ports : tcp : 8443 (for legacy health checks) or 10402 (for split health checks) Priority : 1000 Preventing access to cached content The App Engine firewall sits behind mechanisms that cache content, for example web proxies and browsers.
- If your App Engine flexible environment app is not configured to use Shared VPC , the App Engine flexible environment creates up to two hidden VPC firewall rules, depending on whether your app uses split health checks (default) or legacy health checks.
- These hidden firewall rules allow serving traffic and health check traffic to the flexible environment: Network name : The network specified in app.yaml , or the default network if no network is configured.
- Overview The App Engine firewall is checked for all types of requests to your app, including: Regular web traffic routed to the app's appspot.com address or custom domain.

Evidence snippets:
- If you need to extend the default behavior of split health checks to your application, you can customize the app.yaml file to configure two types of health checks: Liveness checks detect that a VM instance and its container are running.
- App Engine continues to send health check requests and restarts the instance if an unhealthy instance continues to fail to respond to a predetermined number of consecutive health checks.
- As the instance goes through these health checks, the App Engine logs can indicate that the instance is in any of the following states: Healthy .
- Learn more about split health check behaviors in the Migrating to Split Health Checks guide.
