- Unsupported HTTP requests The following features are not supported by App Engine flexible environment: HTTP/2 traffic to the backend service.
- When deploying to Google App Engine, a webserver process such as Gunicorn will serve the app. app . run ( host = "127.0.0.1" , port = 8080 , debug = True ) Quotas and limits App Engine automatically allocates resources to your application as traffic increases.
- However, this is bound by the following restrictions: App Engine reserves automatic scaling capacity for applications with low latency, where the application responds to requests in less than one second.

- The following example demonstrates what a simple Custom Runtime app might require in the flexible environment: You can specify a unique name for your app.yaml files, but then you must specify the file name with the deployment command as well.
- An App Engine app is configured using an app.yaml file, that contains CPU, memory, network and disk resources, scaling, and other general settings including environment variables.
- For example, if you name your app.yaml file service-name-app.yaml or app.flexible.yaml , then you must deploy your app using either: gcloud app deploy service-name-app.yaml gcloud app deploy app.flexible.yaml All configuration elements For a complete list of all the supported elements in this configuration file, see the app.yaml reference .
