Evidence snippets:
- Deleting custom domains from your app In order to delete a custom domain mapping from your app, your account must have the App Engine Admin role ( roles/appengine.appAdmin ) or a custom role that contains the appengine.applications.update permission.
- In order to add or edit a custom domain mapping, your account must have the App Engine Admin role ( roles/appengine.appAdmin ) or a custom role that contains the appengine.applications.get permission.
- Alternatively, you can use gcloud commands or the Admin API to delete custom domains.
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.

Evidence snippets:
- To move from your own SSL certificates to Google-managed SSL certificates, or to add managed SSL certificates to an existing app with a custom domain, update your domain mapping: In the Google Cloud console, go to App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains : Go to Custom Domains Select the domain you want to secure, and click Enable managed security .
- If you use Cloud Load Balancing and serverless network endpoint group (NEGS) to route traffic to your App Engine app, we recommend that you map your custom domain to the load balancer instead of directly to your app, and use Google-managed SSL certificates that are created for the load balancer.
- After mapping a custom domain to your application and updating your DNS records , App Engine provisions a managed SSL certificate, renews the certificate, and revokes it when you remove the custom domain from your application.
- Disable managed SSL certificates To disable managed SSL certificates: In the Google Cloud console, go to App Engine > Settings > Custom Domains : Go to Custom Domains Select the domain and click Disable managed security .

- Example URLs Here are some examples of URLs for App Engine, showing both the appspot.com domain that App Engine assigns to your app and a custom domain, which you can set up for your app .
- For example, to describe version 20191023t101741 for the default service, enter gcloud app versions describe 20191023t101741 --service=default Domain name is included in the request data The domain name used for the request is included in the request data that is passed to your app.
- Routing with a dispatch file You can create a dispatch file to override App Engine's URL-based routing rules and define your own custom routing rules.
- REGION ID .r.appspot.com https:// CUSTOM DOMAIN Requests are received by any version that is configured for traffic in the default service.
