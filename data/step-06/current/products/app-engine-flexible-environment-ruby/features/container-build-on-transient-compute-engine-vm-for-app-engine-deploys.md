- To deploy new versions, a principal must have the Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) role on the assigned App Engine service account , and the Cloud Build Editor ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor ), and Cloud Storage Object Admin ( roles/storage.objectAdmin ) roles on the project.
- To deploy new versions, you must also have the Service Account User ( roles/iam.serviceAccountUser ) role on the assigned App Engine service account , and the Cloud Build Editor ( roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor ), and Cloud Storage Object Admin ( roles/storage.objectAdmin ) roles on the project.
