- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 257
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Similar to machine-learning models, training a Custom Speech-to-Text model is typically iterative and involves selecting a base model as a starting point, fine-tuning it with your text and audio datasets, then testing the recognition quality of the model.
- Using the API, without any code, you can create and train a Custom Speech-to-Text model to improve recognition accuracy from an existing Cloud Speech-to-Text model.
- Delete a custom model Before you start, make sure that there is no traffic routed to your Custom Speech-to-Text model through any endpoint, because deleting it will stop it from serving any requests.
- List your custom models By selecting the Models in the Custom Models section, you can also list all of your Custom Speech-to-Text models, including the ones that are training, active, and deleting.
