Evidence snippets:
- Setting the client IP resolution configuration for an environment in Apigee hybrid is available with hybrid versions 1.14.0 and later.
- Understand the client IP resolution configuration syntax The client IP resolution setting has this format: "clientIpResolutionConfig": { "headerIndexAlgorithm": { "ipHeaderName" : "X-Forwarded-For", "ipHeaderIndex": 2 } } The following example uses the True-Client-Ip header: "clientIpResolutionConfig": { "headerIndexAlgorithm": { "ipHeaderName" : "True-Client-Ip", "ipHeaderIndex": 0 } } where ipHeaderName is the header to use for the client IP.
- When to set the client IP resolution for an environment Although it's not required to set client IP resolution, you might want to if the default client IP address resolution does not meet your needs and you want to override it to provide a specified client IP address resolution for Analytics, Advanced API Security, or performing any other function that requires consistent and reliable information on client IP addresses.
- If the environment-level client IP resolution is not configured, or if the configured header does not exist or does not contain an IP address at the specified index, the client IP address variables are populated using the default client IP address resolution behavior.
