Evidence snippets:
- Go to the VPC Networks page in the Google Cloud console: Go to VPC Networks Required roles To get the permissions that you need to install the Apigee Extension Processor, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: Create and manage service accounts: Service Account Admin ( roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin ) on organization Create and manage service extensions: Service Extensions Admin ( roles/networkservices.serviceExtensionsAdmin ) on organization Create and manage network endpoint groups (NEGs): Compute Instance Admin ( roles/compute.instanceAdmin ) on organization Create and manage networking resources: Compute Network Admin ( roles/compute.networkAdmin ) on organization Create and manage backend services: Compute Load Balancer Admin ( roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin ) on organization Create and manage Apigee resources: Apigee Org Admin ( roles/apigee.admin ) on organization Create and manage traffic extensions: Apigee APIM Service Extension Admin ( roles/apigee.apimServiceExtensionAdmin ) on organization View traffic extensions: Apigee APIM Service Extension Viewer ( roles/apigee.apimServiceExtensionViewer ) on organization Manage long-running operations: Apigee APIM Service Extension Service Agent ( roles/apigee.apimServiceExtensionServiceAgent ) on the service agent in the Google Cloud project For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- Create the traffic extension using the following command to call the Extension Processor provisioning API: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN " \ https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ $ORG NAME /apimServiceExtensions?apimServiceExtensionId = TRAFFIC EXT NAME \ -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d \ '{ "extensionProcessor": " TARGET PROXY NAME " "lbForwardingRule": " LB FORWARDING RULE ", "network" : " NETWORK ", "networkConfigs": [ { "region": "$REGION", "subnet": "project/my-project/regions/$REGION/subnetworks/$SUBNET" } ], "extensions": [ { "name": " TARGET PROXY NAME ", "matchCondition": " CEL EXPRESSION ", "failOpen": FAIL OPEN , "hostname": " ENV GROUP HOSTNAME ", "supportedEvents": [ "REQUEST HEADERS", "RESPONSE HEADERS" ] } ] }' Where: TRAFFIC EXT NAME is is the name of the traffic extension you are creating.
- The response appears similar to the following: { "name" : "my-traffic-extension" , "extensionProcessor" : "my-extension-processor" , "lbForwardingRule" : "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/global/forwardingRules/my-forwarding-rule" , "network" : "projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network" , "networkConfigs" : [ { "region" : "us-west1" , "subnet" : "projects/my-project/regions/us-west1/subnetworks/my-subnet" } ] , "extensions" : [ { "name" : "organizations/my-org/apis/my-api-proxy" , "matchCondition" : "request.url.contains('1234567890')" , "failOpen" : true, "hostname" : "my-hostname.apigee.net" , "supportedEvents" : [ "REQUEST HEADERS" , "RESPONSE HEADERS" ] } ] } Update a traffic extension You can update the traffic extension using the updateMask parameter.
- Update Multiple Attributes (Global LB) To update the extensions and extensionProcessor attributes simultaneously, use the following command: curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN " \ https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ $ORG NAME /apimServiceExtensions/ TRAFFIC EXT NAME ?updateMask = extensions,extensionProcessor \ -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d \ '{ "extensions": [ { "name": " TARGET PROXY NAME ", "matchCondition": " NEW CEL EXPRESSION ", "failOpen": NEW FAIL OPEN , "hostname": " NEW ENV GROUP HOSTNAME ", "supportedEvents": [ "REQUEST HEADERS", "RESPONSE HEADERS" ] } ], "extensionProcessor": " NEW TARGET PROXY NAME " }' Where: TRAFFIC EXT NAME is the name of the Extension Processor traffic extension to update.
