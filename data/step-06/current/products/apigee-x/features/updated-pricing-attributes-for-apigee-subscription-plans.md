- Go to Apigee Entitlements and billing Whether the paid organization uses a Subscription or Pay-as-you-go pricing model, the items that are metered for billing purposes are: environments, API calls, and proxy deployments.
- Subscription plans make sense at higher consumption volumes - where there are larger numbers of environments, a high volume of API calls, or a large number of API proxies under management by Apigee.
- Paid organizations include those created as part of a Subscription or a Pay-as-you-go Apigee pricing model.
- Subscription plans allow you to pre-pay for entitlements, in exchange for significant discounts.
