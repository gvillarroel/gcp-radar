Evidence snippets:
- Create API proxies in Apigee To get started, you'll first need to register the following sample API proxies in your Apigee project: API proxy name Configuration details Base config Revision config Orders API Proxy template: Reverse proxy Target: https://mocktarget.apigee.net Change target endpoint to: https://mocktarget.apigee.net/xml Products API Users API Note: Ensure that each proxy has at least one revision deployed to an environment, and the environment must be part of an environment group.
- Objectives In this tutorial, you will complete the following steps: Step 1: Create an integration for custom curation Step 2: Set up custom curation in API hub Step 3: Edit existing plugin instance Step 4: Verify enriched API data Costs In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud: Application Integration Integration Connectors Cloud Storage Secret Manager To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage, use the pricing calculator .
- It also collates the response of each run in curatedAPIMetadataList , where each element of the array has the response from one particular run. /application-integration/docs/configure-private-trigger">Private Trigger (Enrich each API with spec) Trigger ID: private trigger/test-curate-1 Private 1 Invokes the sub-integration for each element in apiMetaData .
- Before you begin Before you begin this tutorial, ensure you have completed the following: Grant the following IAM roles to the service account that you want to use to create the connection: roles/secretmanager.viewer, roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor roles/storage.admin For information on granting roles, see Granting, changing, and revoking access .

Evidence snippets:
- Go to the VPC Networks page in the Google Cloud console: Go to VPC Networks Required roles To get the permissions that you need to install the Apigee Extension Processor, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles: Create and manage service accounts: Service Account Admin ( roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin ) on organization Create and manage service extensions: Service Extensions Admin ( roles/networkservices.serviceExtensionsAdmin ) on organization Create and manage network endpoint groups (NEGs): Compute Instance Admin ( roles/compute.instanceAdmin ) on organization Create and manage networking resources: Compute Network Admin ( roles/compute.networkAdmin ) on organization Create and manage backend services: Compute Load Balancer Admin ( roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin ) on organization Create and manage Apigee resources: Apigee Org Admin ( roles/apigee.admin ) on organization Create and manage traffic extensions: Apigee APIM Service Extension Admin ( roles/apigee.apimServiceExtensionAdmin ) on organization View traffic extensions: Apigee APIM Service Extension Viewer ( roles/apigee.apimServiceExtensionViewer ) on organization Manage long-running operations: Apigee APIM Service Extension Service Agent ( roles/apigee.apimServiceExtensionServiceAgent ) on the service agent in the Google Cloud project For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations .
- The XML specification for the proxy should appear similar to the following: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?> <APIProxy revision="1" name="extproc-sample"> <DisplayName/> <Description/> <CreatedAt>1739581781912</CreatedAt> <LastModifiedAt>1739582447868</LastModifiedAt> <BasePaths>/</BasePaths> <ProxyEndpoints> <ProxyEndpoint>default</ProxyEndpoint> </ProxyEndpoints> </APIProxy> Configure the EventFlow in the proxy: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?> <APIProxy revision="1" name="extproc-sample"> <DisplayName/> <Description/> <CreatedAt>1739581781912</CreatedAt> <LastModifiedAt>1739582447868</LastModifiedAt> <BasePaths>/</BasePaths> <ProxyEndpoints> <ProxyEndpoint>default</ProxyEndpoint> <EventFlow name="EventFlow" content-type="text/event-stream"> <Response/> </EventFlow> <HTTPProxyConnection> <Properties/> <URL>https://httpbin.org/sse</URL> </HTTPProxyConnection> </ProxyEndpoints> </APIProxy> Follow the steps in Deploy an API proxy to deploy the proxy to the environment you created earlier.
- Create the traffic extension using the following command to call the Extension Processor provisioning API: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN " \ https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ $ORG NAME /apimServiceExtensions?apimServiceExtensionId = TRAFFIC EXT NAME \ -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d \ '{ "extensionProcessor": " TARGET PROXY NAME " "lbForwardingRule": " LB FORWARDING RULE ", "network" : " NETWORK ", "networkConfigs": [ { "region": "$REGION", "subnet": "project/my-project/regions/$REGION/subnetworks/$SUBNET" } ], "extensions": [ { "name": " TARGET PROXY NAME ", "matchCondition": " CEL EXPRESSION ", "failOpen": FAIL OPEN , "hostname": " ENV GROUP HOSTNAME ", "supportedEvents": [ "REQUEST HEADERS", "RESPONSE HEADERS" ] } ] }' Where: TRAFFIC EXT NAME is is the name of the traffic extension you are creating.
- Update Multiple Attributes (Global LB) To update the extensions and extensionProcessor attributes simultaneously, use the following command: curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN " \ https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ $ORG NAME /apimServiceExtensions/ TRAFFIC EXT NAME ?updateMask = extensions,extensionProcessor \ -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d \ '{ "extensions": [ { "name": " TARGET PROXY NAME ", "matchCondition": " NEW CEL EXPRESSION ", "failOpen": NEW FAIL OPEN , "hostname": " NEW ENV GROUP HOSTNAME ", "supportedEvents": [ "REQUEST HEADERS", "RESPONSE HEADERS" ] } ], "extensionProcessor": " NEW TARGET PROXY NAME " }' Where: TRAFFIC EXT NAME is the name of the Extension Processor traffic extension to update.
