Product: Apigee X
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Apigee updated service limits by increasing maximum API proxy endpoints per proxy and defining API base path limits per organization.

## Extended Definition

Apigee updated service limits by increasing maximum API proxy endpoints per proxy and defining API base path limits per organization.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

- See Limits for the maximum number of environments in a single organization.
- Go to Apigee Entitlements and billing Whether the paid organization uses a Subscription or Pay-as-you-go pricing model, the items that are metered for billing purposes are: environments, API calls, and proxy deployments.
- Apigee users Apigee users make up the organization's API team, which can include people such as administrators, API proxy and API product creators, or users monitoring analytics and other statistics.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-2`
- Final score: 127
- Re-rank relevance: WEAK
- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- Before creating the API proxy, set the following environment variable: export PUBLIC DOMAIN NAME = $( gcloud ai index-endpoints describe $INDEX ENDPOINT ID --region = $REGION --project = $PROJECT ID grep "publicEndpointDomainName" awk '{print $2}' ) To create a proxy for use with semantic caching: Go to the API proxies page in the Google Cloud console.
- If your Apigee organization is in an unsupported region, you will have to create index endpoints in a different region than your Apigee organization.
- Deploy the index to the endpoint using the following command: INDEX ENDPOINT ID = $( gcloud ai index-endpoints list \ --project = $PROJECT ID \ --region = $REGION \ --format = "json" jq -c -r \ '.[] select(.displayName=="semantic-cache-index-endpoint") .name split("/") .[5]' \ ) && INDEX ID = $( gcloud ai indexes list \ --project = $PROJECT ID \ --region = $REGION \ --format = "json" jq -c -r \ '.[] select(.displayName=="semantic-cache-index") .name split("/") .[5]' \ ) && gcloud ai index-endpoints deploy-index \ $INDEX ENDPOINT ID \ --deployed-index-id = semantic cache \ --display-name = semantic-cache \ --index = $INDEX ID \ --region = $REGION \ --project = $PROJECT ID Note: The command to deploy the index to the endpoint requires jq .
- Increase quotas for dependent services If you experience performance bottlenecks resulting from higher queries per second (QPS), you may need to increase the following quotas for dependent services in your Google Cloud project: Online prediction requests per minute per region (select by region) Regional online prediction requests per base model per minute per region (select by region and the textembedding-gecko model) Matching Engine stream update requests per minute per region (select by region) To increase a quota for one of these services: Go to the Quota & System Limits page: Go to Quota & System Limits In the filter bar, enter name of the specific quota you want to increase, along with the region and model , name if relevant.

- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-2`
- Final score: 122
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The XML specification for the proxy should appear similar to the following: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?> <APIProxy revision="1" name="extproc-sample"> <DisplayName/> <Description/> <CreatedAt>1739581781912</CreatedAt> <LastModifiedAt>1739582447868</LastModifiedAt> <BasePaths>/</BasePaths> <ProxyEndpoints> <ProxyEndpoint>default</ProxyEndpoint> </ProxyEndpoints> </APIProxy> Configure the EventFlow in the proxy: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?> <APIProxy revision="1" name="extproc-sample"> <DisplayName/> <Description/> <CreatedAt>1739581781912</CreatedAt> <LastModifiedAt>1739582447868</LastModifiedAt> <BasePaths>/</BasePaths> <ProxyEndpoints> <ProxyEndpoint>default</ProxyEndpoint> <EventFlow name="EventFlow" content-type="text/event-stream"> <Response/> </EventFlow> <HTTPProxyConnection> <Properties/> <URL>https://httpbin.org/sse</URL> </HTTPProxyConnection> </ProxyEndpoints> </APIProxy> Follow the steps in Deploy an API proxy to deploy the proxy to the environment you created earlier.
- Create the traffic extension using the following command to call the Extension Processor provisioning API: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN " \ https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ $ORG NAME /apimServiceExtensions?apimServiceExtensionId = TRAFFIC EXT NAME \ -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d \ '{ "extensionProcessor": " TARGET PROXY NAME " "lbForwardingRule": " LB FORWARDING RULE ", "network" : " NETWORK ", "networkConfigs": [ { "region": "$REGION", "subnet": "project/my-project/regions/$REGION/subnetworks/$SUBNET" } ], "extensions": [ { "name": " TARGET PROXY NAME ", "matchCondition": " CEL EXPRESSION ", "failOpen": FAIL OPEN , "hostname": " ENV GROUP HOSTNAME ", "supportedEvents": [ "REQUEST HEADERS", "RESPONSE HEADERS" ] } ] }' Where: TRAFFIC EXT NAME is is the name of the traffic extension you are creating.
- The response appears similar to the following: { "name" : "my-traffic-extension" , "extensionProcessor" : "my-extension-processor" , "lbForwardingRule" : "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/global/forwardingRules/my-forwarding-rule" , "network" : "projects/my-project/global/networks/my-network" , "networkConfigs" : [ { "region" : "us-west1" , "subnet" : "projects/my-project/regions/us-west1/subnetworks/my-subnet" } ] , "extensions" : [ { "name" : "organizations/my-org/apis/my-api-proxy" , "matchCondition" : "request.url.contains('1234567890')" , "failOpen" : true, "hostname" : "my-hostname.apigee.net" , "supportedEvents" : [ "REQUEST HEADERS" , "RESPONSE HEADERS" ] } ] } Update a traffic extension You can update the traffic extension using the updateMask parameter.
- Update Multiple Attributes (Global LB) To update the extensions and extensionProcessor attributes simultaneously, use the following command: curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN " \ https://apigee.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ $ORG NAME /apimServiceExtensions/ TRAFFIC EXT NAME ?updateMask = extensions,extensionProcessor \ -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d \ '{ "extensions": [ { "name": " TARGET PROXY NAME ", "matchCondition": " NEW CEL EXPRESSION ", "failOpen": NEW FAIL OPEN , "hostname": " NEW ENV GROUP HOSTNAME ", "supportedEvents": [ "REQUEST HEADERS", "RESPONSE HEADERS" ] } ], "extensionProcessor": " NEW TARGET PROXY NAME " }' Where: TRAFFIC EXT NAME is the name of the Extension Processor traffic extension to update.
