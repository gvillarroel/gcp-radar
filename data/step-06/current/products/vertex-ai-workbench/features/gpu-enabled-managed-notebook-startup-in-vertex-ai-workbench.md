- Because the training service is fully managed, Vertex AI automatically provisions compute resources, perform the training task, and ensure deletion of compute resources once the training job is finished.
- Learning Objectives Vertex AI experience level : Beginner Estimated reading time : 15 minutes What you'll learn : Benefits of using a managed service for custom training.
- If you want to host and deploy the resulting model on the Vertex AI managed inference service, you'll need to configure an inference container.
