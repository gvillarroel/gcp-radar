- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 220
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Although the use of custom virtual machine (VM) images or Deep Learning VM images with Vertex AI Workbench instances can be possible, Vertex AI Workbench doesn't provide any support for unexpected behaviors or malfunctions when using those images.
- Vertex AI Workbench instances are prepackaged with JupyterLab and have a preinstalled suite of deep learning packages, including support for the TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks.
- Create instances with third party credentials You can create and manage Vertex AI Workbench instances with third party credentials provided by Workforce Identity Federation.
- Introduction to Vertex AI Workbench Vertex AI Workbench instances are Jupyter notebook-based development environments for the entire data science workflow.

- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 206
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, you can grant users roles/notebooks.viewer permissions at the project level so that they can view all Vertex AI Workbench resources in the project, and then you can grant each user roles/notebooks.admin permissions on a specific Vertex AI Workbench instance so that they have all of the admin abilities to administer that instance.
- Vertex AI Workbench uses IAM to manage access to instances and an access mode to manage access to each instance's JupyterLab interface.
- Custom roles If the predefined IAM roles for Vertex AI Workbench don't meet your needs, you can define custom roles.
- Therefore, Notebooks roles define permissions and access to the use of Vertex AI Workbench.
