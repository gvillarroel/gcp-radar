- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Although the use of custom virtual machine (VM) images or Deep Learning VM images with Vertex AI Workbench instances can be possible, Vertex AI Workbench doesn't provide any support for unexpected behaviors or malfunctions when using those images.
- If you have specific compliance or regulatory requirements related to the keys that protect your data, you can use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) with your Vertex AI Workbench instances.
- Custom containers You can create a Vertex AI Workbench instance based on a custom container.
- Using a custom container that isn't derived from the Google-provided base container ( gcr.io/deeplearning-platform-release/workbench-container:latest ) increases the risks of compatibility issues with our services and isn't supported.
