- Final score: 85
- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- To see an example of using the Vertex AI SDK as part of a more comprehensive workflow, run the "Custom training and online prediction" notebook in one of the following environments: Open in Colab Open in Colab Enterprise Open in Vertex AI Workbench View on GitHub Understand the Vertex AI SDK and client library differences When you install the Vertex AI SDK for Python, the Vertex AI Python client library is also installed.
- Write code with the Vertex AI SDK for Python To use the Vertex AI SDK for Python: Install the google-cloud-aiplatform package, which includes both the Vertex AI SDK for Python and the Vertex AI Python client library, by running the following command in your virtual environment: pip install -- upgrade google - cloud - aiplatform Use the following code to import the google.cloud.aiplatform namespace: from google.cloud import aiplatform Preview: To use features for the Vertex AI SDK for Python that are still in preview , import vertexai.preview : import vertexai.preview If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user account: gcloud auth application-default login You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
- Use Vertex AI Python client library and SDK together If you use the Vertex AI SDK for Python and discover you need greater flexibility or control, or if you need a method not included in the Vertex AI SDK, you can use the Vertex AI Python client library in the same workflow.
- Python reference for Vertex AI : contains reference documentation for all of the namespaces, classes, methods, and properties in the google-cloud-aiplatform package, which includes the Vertex AI SDK, the Vertex AI SDK preview, and the Vertex AI Client libraries.

Evidence snippets:
- Notebooks To see examples of how to enable Profiler for a custom training job, run the following notebooks in the environment of your choice: "Training, tuning and deploying a PyTorch text sentiment classification model on Vertex AI": Open in Colab Open in Colab Enterprise Open in Vertex AI Workbench View on GitHub "Get started with Vertex AI Distributed Training": Open in Colab Open in Colab Enterprise Open in Vertex AI Workbench View on GitHub "Run hyperparameter tuning for a TensorFlow model": Open in Colab Open in Colab Enterprise Open in Vertex AI Workbench View on GitHub "Vertex AI TensorBoard custom training with prebuilt container": Open in Colab Open in Colab Enterprise Open in Vertex AI Workbench View on GitHub "PyTorch distributed training with Vertex AI Reduction Server": Open in Colab Open in Colab Enterprise Open in Vertex AI Workbench View on GitHub "Custom training and batch prediction (image classification)": Open in Colab Open in Colab Enterprise Open in Vertex AI Workbench View on GitHub "Custom training and online prediction (image classification)": Open in Colab Open in Colab Enterprise Open in Vertex AI Workbench View on GitHub Video Training custom models Send feedback Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License , and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .
- You can use this option if all of the code needed to execute your training application is in one Python file and one of the prebuilt Vertex AI training containers has all of the libraries needed to run your application.
- For an example of packaging your training application as a Python Source Distribution, see the notebook tutorial Training, tuning and deploying a PyTorch classification model .
- As you build out more complicated workflows, it's likely that you'll use the Vertex AI SDK for Python to configure, submit, and monitor your training jobs.
