- Final score: 185
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, you can grant users roles/notebooks.viewer permissions at the project level so that they can view all Vertex AI Workbench resources in the project, and then you can grant each user roles/notebooks.admin permissions on a specific user-managed notebooks instance so that they have all of the admin abilities to administer that instance.
- This page describes how to use Identity and Access Management (IAM) and an access mode to manage access to Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks resources.
- Vertex AI Workbench uses IAM to manage access to user-managed notebooks instances and an access mode to manage access to each instance's JupyterLab interface.
- To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you migrate your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances .
