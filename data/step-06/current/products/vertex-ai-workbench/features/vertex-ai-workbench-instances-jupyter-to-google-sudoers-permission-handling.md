### Vertex AI Workbench instances access control \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- URL: [https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/iam](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/iam)
- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 246
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Vertex AI Workbench uses IAM to manage access to instances and an access mode to manage access to each instance's JupyterLab interface.
- For example, you can grant users roles/notebooks.viewer permissions at the project level so that they can view all Vertex AI Workbench resources in the project, and then you can grant each user roles/notebooks.admin permissions on a specific Vertex AI Workbench instance so that they have all of the admin abilities to administer that instance.
- Types of IAM roles There are different types of IAM roles that can be used in Vertex AI Workbench: Predefined roles let you grant a set of related permissions to your Vertex AI Workbench resources at the project level.
- Control access to an instance's JupyterLab interface with the access mode You control access to a Vertex AI Workbench instance's JupyterLab interface through the instance's access mode.

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 218
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Vertex AI Workbench instances are prepackaged with JupyterLab and have a preinstalled suite of deep learning packages, including support for the TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks.
- Introduction to Vertex AI Workbench Vertex AI Workbench instances are Jupyter notebook-based development environments for the entire data science workflow.
- Although the use of custom virtual machine (VM) images or Deep Learning VM images with Vertex AI Workbench instances can be possible, Vertex AI Workbench doesn't provide any support for unexpected behaviors or malfunctions when using those images.
- When you use Access Context Manager and Chrome Enterprise Premium to protect Vertex AI Workbench instances with context-aware access controls, access is evaluated each time the user authenticates to the instance.
