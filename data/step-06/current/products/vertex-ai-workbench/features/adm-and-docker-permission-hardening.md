- Source ID: `site-docs-reference-2`
- Final score: 67
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, you can grant users roles/notebooks.viewer permissions at the project level so that they can view all Vertex AI Workbench resources in the project, and then you can grant each user roles/notebooks.admin permissions on a specific managed notebooks instance so that they have all of the admin abilities to administer that instance.
- Types of IAM roles There are different types of IAM roles that can be used in Vertex AI Workbench: Predefined roles let you grant a set of related permissions to your Vertex AI Workbench resources at the project level.
- Therefore, Notebooks roles define permissions and access to the use of Vertex AI Workbench.
- The basic roles provide permissions across Google Cloud, not just for Vertex AI Workbench.
