- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 246
- Re-rank relevance: WEAK
- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- When you use Access Context Manager and Chrome Enterprise Premium to protect Vertex AI Workbench instances with context-aware access controls, access is evaluated each time the user authenticates to the instance.
- To use accelerators with Vertex AI Workbench instances, the accelerator type that you want must be available in your instance's zone.
- Adding conda environments lets you use kernels that aren't available in the default Vertex AI Workbench instance.
- Although the use of custom virtual machine (VM) images or Deep Learning VM images with Vertex AI Workbench instances can be possible, Vertex AI Workbench doesn't provide any support for unexpected behaviors or malfunctions when using those images.

- Re-rank relevance: WEAK
- Re-rank rationale: Fallback relevance because reranking failed.

Evidence snippets:
- To see an example of using the Vertex AI SDK as part of a more comprehensive workflow, run the "Custom training and online prediction" notebook in one of the following environments: Open in Colab Open in Colab Enterprise Open in Vertex AI Workbench View on GitHub Understand the Vertex AI SDK and client library differences When you install the Vertex AI SDK for Python, the Vertex AI Python client library is also installed.
- The Vertex AI SDK is available for Python and a Vertex AI client library is available for Python, Java, and Node.js.
- Write code with the Vertex AI SDK for Python To use the Vertex AI SDK for Python: Install the google-cloud-aiplatform package, which includes both the Vertex AI SDK for Python and the Vertex AI Python client library, by running the following command in your virtual environment: pip install -- upgrade google - cloud - aiplatform Use the following code to import the google.cloud.aiplatform namespace: from google.cloud import aiplatform Preview: To use features for the Vertex AI SDK for Python that are still in preview , import vertexai.preview : import vertexai.preview If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user account: gcloud auth application-default login You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
- Use Vertex AI Python client library and SDK together If you use the Vertex AI SDK for Python and discover you need greater flexibility or control, or if you need a method not included in the Vertex AI SDK, you can use the Vertex AI Python client library in the same workflow.

- Source ID: `site-iam-reference`
- Final score: 230
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- For example, you can grant users roles/notebooks.viewer permissions at the project level so that they can view all Vertex AI Workbench resources in the project, and then you can grant each user roles/notebooks.admin permissions on a specific Vertex AI Workbench instance so that they have all of the admin abilities to administer that instance.
- Types of IAM roles There are different types of IAM roles that can be used in Vertex AI Workbench: Predefined roles let you grant a set of related permissions to your Vertex AI Workbench resources at the project level.
- Access control This page describes how to use Identity and Access Management (IAM) and an access mode to manage access to Vertex AI Workbench resources.
- Therefore, Notebooks roles define permissions and access to the use of Vertex AI Workbench.
