- Source ID: `site-docs-root`
- Final score: 196
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- The use of a user-managed notebooks image or managed notebooks image to create a Vertex AI Workbench instance isn't supported.
- Vertex AI Workbench instances expect images from the cloud-notebooks-managed project.
- To edit a Vertex AI Workbench instance's underlying VM, use the projects.locations.instances.patch method in the Notebooks API or the gcloud workbench instances update command in the Google Cloud SDK.
- If you have specific compliance or regulatory requirements related to the keys that protect your data, you can use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) with your Vertex AI Workbench instances.
