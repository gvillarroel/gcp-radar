- Example: Savepoint support (Click to expand) The following example shows how to enable and disable savepoints support in the Spanner JDBC driver. try ( Connection connection = DriverManager . getConnection ( String . format ( "jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/%s/instances/%s/databases/%s" , "my-project" , "my-instance" , "my-database" ))) { // Savepoints can only be used when AutoCommit=false. connection . setAutoCommit ( false ); // Disables setting a savepoint. connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SAVEPOINT SUPPORT='DISABLED'" ); // The following statement fails because savepoints have been disabled. connection . setSavepoint ( "my savepoint1" ); // Enables setting a savepoint and releasing a savepoint. // Rolling back to a savepoint is disabled. connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SAVEPOINT SUPPORT='FAIL AFTER ROLLBACK'" ); Savepoint mySavepoint2 = connection . setSavepoint ( "my savepoint2" ); connection . createStatement (). execute ( "insert into my table (id, value) values (1, 'One')" ); connection . releaseSavepoint ( mySavepoint2 ); connection . commit (); // Enables setting, releasing and rolling back to a savepoint. connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SAVEPOINT SUPPORT='ENABLED'" ); Savepoint mySavepoint3 = connection . setSavepoint ( "my savepoint3" ); connection . createStatement (). execute ( "insert into my table (id, value) values (2, 'Two')" ); connection . rollback ( mySavepoint3 ); } What's next Learn how to connect JDBC to a GoogleSQL-dialect database .
- The Spanner JDBC driver supports three alternatives for executing partitioned queries: SET AUTO PARTITION MODE = true RUN PARTITIONED QUERY sql PARTITION sql followed by multiple RUN PARTITION 'partition-token' Each of these methods are described in the following sections.
- The Spanner JDBC driver (Java Database Connectivity) supports session management statements, which let you modify the state of your connection, execute transactions, and efficiently execute batches of statements.
