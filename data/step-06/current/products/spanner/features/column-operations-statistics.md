### "Best practices for using Spanner as a gaming database \_|\_ Google Cloud\

- Final score: 112
- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Evaluate Spanner needs for production When you move from development to testing, and then into production, it's important that you reevaluate your Spanner needs to insure your game can handle live player traffic.
- With the scalability of Spanner, it means that data doesn't need to be sharded into separate database instances when more performance or storage is needed; instead, you can add more nodes.
- In the following diagram, adding an IndexPartition column to the schema after the launch resolves the hotspot issue, and players are evenly distributed across the available Spanner splits.
- Warm up the database before game launch Before you launch your game, we recommend that you warm up your database to take advantage of the Spanner parallelization features.

Evidence snippets:
- Database schema The queries and execution plans on this page are based on the following database schema: CREATE TABLE Singers ( SingerId INT64 NOT NULL , FirstName STRING ( 1024 ), LastName STRING ( 1024 ), SingerInfo BYTES ( MAX ), BirthDate DATE ) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId ); CREATE INDEX SingersByFirstLastName ON Singers ( FirstName , LastName ); CREATE TABLE Albums ( SingerId INT64 NOT NULL , AlbumId INT64 NOT NULL , AlbumTitle STRING ( MAX ), MarketingBudget INT64 ) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId , AlbumId ), INTERLEAVE IN PARENT Singers ON DELETE CASCADE ; CREATE INDEX AlbumsByAlbumTitle ON Albums ( AlbumTitle ); CREATE INDEX AlbumsByAlbumTitle2 ON Albums ( AlbumTitle ) STORING ( MarketingBudget ); CREATE TABLE Songs ( SingerId INT64 NOT NULL , AlbumId INT64 NOT NULL , TrackId INT64 NOT NULL , SongName STRING ( MAX ), Duration INT64 , SongGenre STRING ( 25 ) ) PRIMARY KEY ( SingerId , AlbumId , TrackId ), INTERLEAVE IN PARENT Albums ON DELETE CASCADE ; CREATE INDEX SongsBySingerAlbumSongNameDesc ON Songs ( SingerId , AlbumId , SongName DESC ), INTERLEAVE IN Albums ; CREATE INDEX SongsBySongName ON Songs ( SongName ); CREATE TABLE Concerts ( VenueId INT64 NOT NULL , SingerId INT64 NOT NULL , ConcertDate DATE NOT NULL , BeginTime TIMESTAMP , EndTime TIMESTAMP , TicketPrices ARRAY<INT64> ) PRIMARY KEY ( VenueId , SingerId , ConcertDate ); You can use the following Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements to add data to these tables: INSERT INTO Singers ( SingerId , FirstName , LastName , BirthDate ) VALUES ( 1 , "Marc" , "Richards" , "1970-09-03" ), ( 2 , "Catalina" , "Smith" , "1990-08-17" ), ( 3 , "Alice" , "Trentor" , "1991-10-02" ), ( 4 , "Lea" , "Martin" , "1991-11-09" ), ( 5 , "David" , "Lomond" , "1977-01-29" ); INSERT INTO Albums ( SingerId , AlbumId , AlbumTitle ) VALUES ( 1 , 1 , "Total Junk" ), ( 1 , 2 , "Go, Go, Go" ), ( 2 , 1 , "Green" ), ( 2 , 2 , "Forever Hold Your Peace" ), ( 2 , 3 , "Terrified" ), ( 3 , 1 , "Nothing To Do With Me" ), ( 4 , 1 , "Play" ); INSERT INTO Songs ( SingerId , AlbumId , TrackId , SongName , Duration , SongGenre ) VALUES ( 2 , 1 , 1 , "Let's Get Back Together" , 182 , "COUNTRY" ), ( 2 , 1 , 2 , "Starting Again" , 156 , "ROCK" ), ( 2 , 1 , 3 , "I Knew You Were Magic" , 294 , "BLUES" ), ( 2 , 1 , 4 , "42" , 185 , "CLASSICAL" ), ( 2 , 1 , 5 , "Blue" , 238 , "BLUES" ), ( 2 , 1 , 6 , "Nothing Is The Same" , 303 , "BLUES" ), ( 2 , 1 , 7 , "The Second Time" , 255 , "ROCK" ), ( 2 , 3 , 1 , "Fight Story" , 194 , "ROCK" ), ( 3 , 1 , 1 , "Not About The Guitar" , 278 , "BLUES" ); Note: You can run queries and retrieve execution plans even if the tables have no data.
- The following query uses a semi join to find which singers do have an Album: SELECT FirstName , LastName FROM Singers WHERE SingerId IN ( SELECT SingerId FROM Albums ); / -----------+----------+ FirstName LastName +-----------+----------+ Marc Richards Catalina Smith Alice Trentor Lea Martin +-----------+---------- / The plan segment appears as follows: Anti-semi apply An Anti-semi apply operator is similar to a semi apply operator, except that it returns the input table columns only when a match doesn't occur on the map side.
- SELECT si . firstname , ( SELECT so . songname FROM songs AS so WHERE so . singerid = si . singerid LIMIT 1 ) FROM singers AS si ; / -----------+--------------------------+ FirstName Unspecified +-----------+--------------------------+ Alice Not About The Guitar Catalina Let's Get Back Together David NULL Lea NULL Marc NULL +-----------+-------------------------- / The query populates the first column from the Singers table, and the second column from the Songs table.
- In cases where a SingerId existed in the Singers table but there was no matching SingerId in the Songs table, the second column contains NULL .
