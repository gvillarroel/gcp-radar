# SPANNER_SYS Query statistics table

Product: Spanner
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

The SPANNER_SYS Query statistics table was enhanced with new columns including LATENCY_DISTRIBUTION and RUN_IN_RW_TRANSACTION_EXECUTION_COUNT.

## Extended Definition

The SPANNER_SYS Query statistics table was enhanced with new columns including LATENCY_DISTRIBUTION and RUN_IN_RW_TRANSACTION_EXECUTION_COUNT.

## Evidence Summary

Fallback definition because synthesis failed; coverage was derived from supporting-page quality.

Evidence snippets:
- The following columns in the SPANNER SYS statistics tables: Transaction statistics : TOTAL LATENCY DISTRIBUTION and OPERATIONS BY TABLE Query statistics : LATENCY DISTRIBUTION Lock Statistics : SAMPLE LOCK REQUESTS We recommend using the following JSON-compatible string representation columns instead: Transaction statistics : TOTAL LATENCY DISTRIBUTION JSON STRING and OPERATIONS BY TABLE JSON STRING Query statistics : LATENCY DISTRIBUTION JSON STRING Lock Statistics : SAMPLE LOCK REQUESTS JSON STRING TABLESAMPLE We recommend that you apply a custom function F , which converts a row to TEXT or BYTEA .
- In the following example, we use CONCAT as our function F : -- Given the following schema CREATE TABLE singers ( singer id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, first name VARCHAR(1024), last name VARCHAR(1024), singer info BYTEA ); -- Create a hash for each row (using all columns) WITH hashed rows AS ( SELECT , ABS(MOD(spanner.farm fingerprint( CONCAT( singer id::text, first name, last name, singer info::text ) ), 100)) AS hash value FROM singers ) -- Sample data SELECT FROM hashed rows WHERE hash value < 10 -- sample roughly 10% LIMIT 10; / Optional: LIMIT to a max of 10 rows to be returned / VALUE IN UNNEST(ARRAY(...)) Use the equality operator with the ANY function, as shown in the following example: SELECT value = any(array[...]) GoogleSQL dialect function differences GoogleSQL function PostgreSQL dialect recommendation ACOSH Use the formula of the function explicitly, as shown in the following example: SELECT LN(x + SQRT(x x - 1)); APPROX COSINE DISTANCE No recommendation available.
- Use a subquery with the ORDER BY or LIMIT clauses, as shown in the following example: SELECT FROM ( (expression) UNION ALL SELECT NULL, … -- as many columns as you have ) AS rows ORDER BY 1 NULLS LAST LIMIT 1; ARRAY CONCAT AGG You can use ARRAY AGG and UNNEST as shown in the following example: WITH albums AS ( SELECT ARRAY['Song A', NULL, 'Song B'] AS songs UNION ALL SELECT NULL UNION ALL SELECT ARRAY[]::TEXT[] ) SELECT ARRAY AGG(song) FROM albums, UNNEST(songs) song; ARRAY FIRST Use the array subscript operator, as shown in the following example: SELECT array expression[1]; Note that this will return NULL for empty arrays.
- ARRAY INCLUDES Use the equality operator with the ANY function, as shown in the following example: SELECT search value = ANY(array to search); ARRAY INCLUDES ALL Use the array contains operator, as shown in the following example: SELECT array to search @> search values; ARRAY INCLUDES ANY Use the array overlap operator, as shown in the following example: SELECT array to search && search values; ARRAY IS DISTINCT Use a subquery to count distinct values and compare them to the original array length, as shown in the following example: SELECT ARRAY LENGTH(value, 1) = ( SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e) FROM UNNEST(value) AS e); ARRAY LAST Use the array subscript operator, as shown in the following example SELECT (value)[ARRAY LENGTH(value, 1)]; This returns NULL for empty arrays.
