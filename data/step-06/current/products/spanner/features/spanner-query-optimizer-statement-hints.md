- Example: Savepoint support (Click to expand) The following example shows how to enable and disable savepoints support in the Spanner JDBC driver. try ( Connection connection = DriverManager . getConnection ( String . format ( "jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/%s/instances/%s/databases/%s" , "my-project" , "my-instance" , "my-database" ))) { // Savepoints can only be used when AutoCommit=false. connection . setAutoCommit ( false ); // Disables setting a savepoint. connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SPANNER.SAVEPOINT SUPPORT='DISABLED'" ); // The following statement fails because savepoints have been disabled. connection . setSavepoint ( "my savepoint1" ); // Enables setting a savepoint and releasing a savepoint. // Rolling back to a savepoint is disabled. connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SPANNER.SAVEPOINT SUPPORT='FAIL AFTER ROLLBACK'" ); Savepoint mySavepoint2 = connection . setSavepoint ( "my savepoint2" ); connection . createStatement (). execute ( "insert into my table (id, value) values (1, 'One')" ); connection . releaseSavepoint ( mySavepoint2 ); connection . commit (); // Enables setting, releasing and rolling back to a savepoint. connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SPANNER.SAVEPOINT SUPPORT='ENABLED'" ); Savepoint mySavepoint3 = connection . setSavepoint ( "my savepoint3" ); connection . createStatement (). execute ( "insert into my table (id, value) values (2, 'Two')" ); connection . rollback ( mySavepoint3 ); } What's next Learn how to connect JDBC to a PostgreSQL-dialect database .
- ROLLBACK ; Data Boost and partitioned query statements The partitionQuery API divides a query into smaller pieces, or partitions, and uses multiple machines to fetch the partitions in parallel.
- OPTIMIZER STATISTICS PACKAGE { TO = } { 'package' '' } Sets the optimizer statistics package to use for all following statements on the connection. <package> must be a valid package name.
- OPTIMIZER VERSION { TO = } { 'version' 'LATEST' '' } Sets the version of the optimizer to be used for all the following statements on the connection.

Evidence snippets:
- Spanner again displays the Singers table's Spanner Studio page with a new query tab that contains the same INSERT and SELECT statements.
- The Google Cloud console displays the Singers table's Spanner Studio page with a new query tab that contains the INSERT statement that you edit to insert a row in the Singers table and view the result of that insertion: GoogleSQL -- Add new values in the VALUES clause in order of the column list. -- Each value must be type compatible with its associated column.
- When finished, the Results tab shows that the statement inserted one row: GoogleSQL PostgreSQL In the Explorer, click more vert View actions next to the Singers table, and then click Insert data .
- The Singers table now has two rows: GoogleSQL PostgreSQL Run a query in the Google Cloud console On the database Overview page, click Spanner Studio in the navigation menu.
