# Spanner read leases

Product: Spanner
Coverage: MEDIUM

## Step 02 Summary

Read lease regions for Spanner allow strong reads to be served locally from designated non-leader regions in multi-region or dual-region instances, reducing latency by avoiding leader-region round trips.

## Extended Definition

Read lease regions for Spanner allow strong reads to be served locally from designated non-leader regions in multi-region or dual-region instances, reducing latency by avoiding leader-region round trips.

Evidence snippets:
- Performing a ROLLBACK of a read-write transaction clears any buffered mutations, rolls back the transaction on Spanner, and releases any locks the transaction held.
- Committing a read-write transaction makes all updates of this transaction visible to other transactions and releases all of the transaction's locks on Spanner.
- Example: Savepoint support (Click to expand) The following example shows how to enable and disable savepoints support in the Spanner JDBC driver. try ( Connection connection = DriverManager . getConnection ( String . format ( "jdbc:cloudspanner:/projects/%s/instances/%s/databases/%s" , "my-project" , "my-instance" , "my-database" ))) { // Savepoints can only be used when AutoCommit=false. connection . setAutoCommit ( false ); // Disables setting a savepoint. connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SAVEPOINT SUPPORT='DISABLED'" ); // The following statement fails because savepoints have been disabled. connection . setSavepoint ( "my savepoint1" ); // Enables setting a savepoint and releasing a savepoint. // Rolling back to a savepoint is disabled. connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SAVEPOINT SUPPORT='FAIL AFTER ROLLBACK'" ); Savepoint mySavepoint2 = connection . setSavepoint ( "my savepoint2" ); connection . createStatement (). execute ( "insert into my table (id, value) values (1, 'One')" ); connection . releaseSavepoint ( mySavepoint2 ); connection . commit (); // Enables setting, releasing and rolling back to a savepoint. connection . createStatement (). execute ( "SET SAVEPOINT SUPPORT='ENABLED'" ); Savepoint mySavepoint3 = connection . setSavepoint ( "my savepoint3" ); connection . createStatement (). execute ( "insert into my table (id, value) values (2, 'Two')" ); connection . rollback ( mySavepoint3 ); } What's next Learn how to connect JDBC to a GoogleSQL-dialect database .

### "Best practices for using Spanner as a gaming database \_|\_ Google Cloud\

- Source ID: `site-docs-root`

- Re-rank relevance: N/A

Evidence snippets:
- Even when using Spanner to hold all of your game data worldwide, it offers read-write transactions with even stronger than conventional atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties.
- We also recommend using the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) v4 , because it spreads the player data across DB nodes and can help you get increased performance out of Spanner.
- Similar to other relational databases, an inventory table in Spanner has a primary key that is a globally unique identifier for the item, as illustrated in the following table. itemID type playerID 7c14887e-8d45 1 6f1ede3b-25e2 8ca83609-bb93 40 6f1ede3b-25e2 33fedada-3400 1 5fa0aa7d-16da e4714487-075e 23 5fa0aa7d-16da d4fbfb92-a8bd 14 5fa0aa7d-16da 31b7067b-42ec 3 26a38c2c-123a In the example inventory table, itemID and playerID are truncated for readability.
- In load tests, this model does an acceptable job of distributing the secondary index read and write load across multiple Spanner splits, as illustrated in the following diagram: Although the synthetic data used in the load test is similar to the eventual steady state of the game where Attribute values are well distributed, the game design dictates that all players start with Attribute=50 .
