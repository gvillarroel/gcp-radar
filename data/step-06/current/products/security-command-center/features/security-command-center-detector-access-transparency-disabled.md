- Standard, Premium, and Enterprise service tiers The Vulnerability Assessment for Google Cloud service detects software vulnerabilities in the following resources on the Google Cloud platform: Running Compute Engine VM instances Nodes in GKE Standard clusters Containers running in GKE Standard and GKE Autopilot clusters For each detected vulnerability, Vulnerability Assessment for Google Cloud generates a Vulnerability class finding in the Software vulnerability or OS vulnerability finding category in Security Command Center.
- In the Enterprise or Premium tier of Security Command Center, the Risk Engine detects groups of security issues that, when they occur together in a particular pattern, create a path to one or more of your high-value resources that a determined attacker could potentially use to reach and compromise those resources.

Evidence snippets:
- Note : If Security Command Center is activated at the organization level at any tier, then this detector uses an organization's existing IAM policies as context.
- Cloud IDS detects layer 7 attacks by analyzing mirrored packets and, when a threat event is detected, sends a threat-class finding to Security Command Center.
- If Security Command Center activation is only at the project level, then the detector uses only the project's IAM policies as context.
- All Security Command Center roles Logging roles : control access to an organization's logs roles/errorreporting.
