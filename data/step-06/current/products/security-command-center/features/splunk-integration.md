- In addition, Security Command Center can automatically send findings, assets, audit logs, and security sources to Splunk .
- The following features and capabilities of the Enterprise tier are new to Security Command Center: Multicloud support : You can now connect Security Command Center to Amazon Web Services for the following capabilities: Detect threats and vulnerabilities Assess the risk exposure of your high-value AWS resources Assess compliance with security standards A new Security Operations console for global security operations tasks SIEM and SOAR capabilities for security operations Security investigation and event management (SIEM) capabilities: Ingest and normalize logs from Google Cloud, AWS, Security Command Center findings, and resource metadata from multiple sources Detect the most important cloud threats with curated threat detection Search across consolidated SIEM data Security operations and response (SOAR) capabilities: Manage detections, investigations, and responses with cases Automate response workflows with playbooks Focus on posture and threat findings with dedicated views in the Security Operations console Integrate with IT service management products, such as Jira and ServiceNow, for posture management Search across consolidated SOAR data The following attack exposure scoring features are in General Availability: Attack exposure scores now calculated for high-value resources Severities of vulnerability findings can vary to align with attack exposure scores Optional automated assignment of resource values with Sensitive Data Protection Vulnerability and misconfiguration detections Security Health Analytics includes the following enhancements: New misconfiguration detectors for AWS resources Detectors are mapped to new security standards You can now manage the remediation of critical and high severity vulnerability and misconfiguration findings using cases that are automatically opened for you.
- Threat detection and investigation Detect threats in your AWS deployments Investigate and respond to incidents with SIEM-like capabilities across 90 days of cloud logs Manage the investigation of and response to threats by using cases Define response workflows and automated actions in response to threats by using playbooks Mandiant Attack Surface Management integration Mandiant Attack Surface Management scans your external attack surfaces to identify vulnerability and misconfiguration findings Sensitive Data Protection integration The Risk overview page of Security Command Center in the Google Cloud console now shows data security findings from the Sensitive Data Protection discovery service Findings from Sensitive Data Protection that indicate the sensitivity and data risk levels of your data can inform the automated assignment of resource values for the attack path simulation feature Gemini artificial intelligence features Natural language search for threat findings AI investigation widget for cases Compliance, security standards Support for AWS security standards Validate infrastructure as code (IaC) against organization policies and Security Health Analytics detectors.
- Security Command Center will also begin preventing the manual creation of findings under the exact same name as a source that is automatically managed by Security Command Center in order to prevent the creation of findings that can never be resolved.
