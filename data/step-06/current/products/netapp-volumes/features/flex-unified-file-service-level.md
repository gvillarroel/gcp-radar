Evidence snippets:
- Create a storage pool: gcloud beta netapp storage-pools create POOL NAME \ --project = PROJECT ID \ --location = LOCATION \ --capacity = CAPACITY \ --service-level = Flex \ --network = name = NETWORK NAME \ --type = UNIFIED \ --mode = MODE \ --total-iops = IOPS \ --total-throughput = THROUGHPUT \ --allow-auto-tiering = true \ --hot-tier-size = HOT TIER SIZE \ --enable-hot-tier-auto-resize = ENABLE HOT TIER AUTO RESIZE Replace the following information: POOL NAME : the name of the pool you want to create.
- Select a service level: Flex Standard Premium Extreme For the Flex service level, configure the following options: Type : you can select either the File or Unified type.
- For Flex Unified (Preview) and Flex File custom-performance zonal pools (generally available (GA)): you must enable auto-tiering during pool creation.
- Optional: for the Flex Unified service level, enable the Large volume option to create large volumes .

### Manage auto-tiering \_|\_ NetApp Volumes \_|\_ Google Cloud Documentation

- Re-rank relevance: MODERATE
- Re-rank rationale: Fast mode kept the lexical match without page-level LLM reranking.

Evidence snippets:
- Flex type volumes Auto-tiering is available for Flex Unified and Flex File custom-performance pools.
- Auto-tiering doesn't affect the throughput and IOPS capability of the Flex Unified and Flex File custom-performance pools, but accessing cold data results in higher latency and reduced throughput.
- The cooling threshold is defined at the volume level and can be set between 2 to 183 days for the Flex, Premium, and Extreme volumes.
- For Flex Unified and Flex File custom performance pools, auto-tiering can only be enabled during storage pool creation.
