- When you use the detailed usage cost data in BigQuery, note the following: The table schema for the detailed Cloud Billing data export can change over time, such as when new fields are added to the detailed export.
- Detailed usage cost data schema In your BigQuery dataset, your detailed Google Cloud usage cost data is loaded into a data table named gcp billing export resource v1 <BILLING ACCOUNT ID> .
- When selecting or creating a BigQuery dataset for your detailed usage cost data , you can select any dataset location that is supported for use with Cloud Billing data .
