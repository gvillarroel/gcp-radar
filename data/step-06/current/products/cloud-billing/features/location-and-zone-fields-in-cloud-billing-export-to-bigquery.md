- When you enable the standard usage cost data export for the first time in Cloud Billing, if you select a dataset configured to use a multi-region location (EU or US), Cloud Billing data will be available retroactively from the start of the previous month.
- If you enable the standard usage cost data export and select a dataset that's configured to use a supported region location , your Cloud Billing data will be available starting from the date when you enabled the export.
- When you use the standard usage cost data in BigQuery, note the following: The table schema for the standard Cloud Billing data export can change over time, such as when new fields are added to the standard export.
