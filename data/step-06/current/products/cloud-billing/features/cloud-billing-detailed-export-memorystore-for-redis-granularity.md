Evidence snippets:
- Prerequisites to generate and run a query To generate a query from a Cloud Billing Report , ensure you and your Cloud Billing account meet the following requirements: On your Cloud Billing account, Cloud Billing data export to BigQuery must be enabled, for either the standard usage cost data or detailed usage cost data .
- To ensure you have a complete set of Cloud Billing data for your custom analysis needs, we recommend you enable billing data export to BigQuery when you first set up a Cloud Billing account.
- A new browser window opens for BigQuery Studio, and a SQL query is generated, configured to query your exported billing data with the equivalent parameters in use on your Billing Report.
- Note: If both standard and detailed cost data exports are enabled, when you generate a query, the query is created for the detailed usage cost data.
