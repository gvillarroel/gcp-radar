- Common values used in the example standard cost queries The query examples in this section use the following value for Table name : project.dataset.gcp billing export v1 XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX These query examples also work with the detailed usage cost data exported to BigQuery, although they aren't written to retrieve any of the resource-level information that's provided with the detailed usage cost export option.
- Detailed usage cost table : In your BigQuery dataset, this table is named gcp billing export resource v1 <BILLING ACCOUNT ID> .
