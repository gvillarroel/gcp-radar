Evidence snippets:
- As of January 1, 2022, the following data is available in the Cloud Billing reports: Project hierarchy : Project hierarchy is the project's ancestry, the resource hierarchy mapping of a project (Organization > Folder > Project).
- Understand and analyze changes in project ancestry For the time range you're analyzing, it's possible for the same Project to be listed in more than one row in the report table.
- The Cloud Billing reports don't support filtering or grouping by zone .
- To view the cost reports for your Cloud Billing account, including viewing the cost information for all of the Google Cloud projects that are linked to the billing account, you need a role on your Cloud Billing account that includes the following permissions : billing.accounts.get billing.accounts.getSpendingInformation To gain these permissions using a predefined role , ask your administrator to grant you one of the following Cloud Billing IAM roles on your Cloud Billing account: Billing Account Viewer Billing Account Costs Manager Billing Account Administrator For more information about Cloud Billing permissions, see: Overview of Cloud Billing access control Create custom roles for Cloud Billing Understanding predefined Identity and Access Management roles for Cloud Billing To view all costs for an individual Google Cloud project, you need billing-specific permissions on the Google Cloud project .
