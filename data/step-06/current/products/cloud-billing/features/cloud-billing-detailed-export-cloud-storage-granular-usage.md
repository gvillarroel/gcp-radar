Evidence snippets:
- The detailed export includes granular cost information about the following services: AlloyDB for PostgreSQL App Engine BigQuery Bigtable Cloud Data Fusion Cloud Deploy Cloud Run functions Cloud Logging Cloud Run Cloud SQL Cloud Storage Compute Engine Dataflow Managed Service for Apache Spark Metastore Firestore and Datastore Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) To view a breakdown of GKE cluster costs in a detailed data export, you must also enable cost allocation for GKE .
- Return the resource-level costs on an invoice Sum costs for each resource, per invoice Return details by cost type for each resource, per invoice month Get breakdown of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster costs Filter GKE cost breakdown Because the detailed usage cost schema includes all of the fields from the standard usage cost schema, the query examples provided for the standard data exported to BigQuery also work with the detailed data that's exported.
- When you enable the detailed usage cost data export for the first time in Cloud Billing, if you select a dataset configured to use a multi-region location (EU or US), Cloud Billing data will be available retroactively from the start of the previous month.
- If you enable the detailed usage cost data export and select a dataset that's configured to use a supported region location , your Cloud Billing data will be available starting from the date when you enabled the export.
