Evidence snippets:
- Cloud Billing export to BigQuery lets you export detailed Google Cloud billing data (such as usage, cost estimates, and pricing data) automatically throughout the day to a BigQuery dataset that you specify.
- For your BigQuery datasets containing standard usage cost data or detailed usage cost data , the type of location you configure on the dataset impacts the timing of when your Google Cloud billing data is exported to the dataset: If you configure the dataset to use a multi-region location (EU or US), the dataset includes Google Cloud billing data incurred from the start of the previous month from when you first enabled the export.
- On the example queries page, you'll find various SQL examples, including the following: Return the total costs on an invoice Query your data using labels Return data about your committed use discounts Query costs and credits by project for a specified invoice month Join pricing data with detailed usage cost data Cost of use Using BigQuery to store and analyze billing usage and cost data typically incurs minimal fees.
