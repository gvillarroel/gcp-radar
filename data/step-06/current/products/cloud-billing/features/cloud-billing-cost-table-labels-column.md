Evidence snippets:
- The Cloud Billing report shows you the cost data for a specific label only after the label was added to a resource.
- Analyze the report when grouped by Project hierarchy You can sort the table data on different columns to view the project hierarchy costs in different ways: To visualize all of the projects that have the same project hierarchy, sort the table by the Project hierarchy column.
- Negotiated savings: When you set the report time range by Invoice month , starting with the May 2021 invoice, Cloud Billing accounts associated with a custom pricing contract display Negotiated savings as a savings column, separate from the List cost column.
- If your Cloud Billing account is associated with a custom pricing contract and your report settings result in the display of the Negotiated savings column, you will see a List cost column in your CSV download .
